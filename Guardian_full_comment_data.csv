lately i have heard both men and women addressed as guys in america this is not pejorative
that now refer in a pejorative way to their sexual relations
i realised that bossy among children was applied exclusively to girls not in this family its applied to two boys and a girl and it is unacceptable regardless of gender
i hate being called madam a double glazing person came to my door yesterday and called me madam i asked him if thought i ran a brothel he looked surprised and i explained that most women i know dont like being called madam he forgot all about replacement doors and windows and moved on very quickly
words evolve and develop nuances over time for all sorts of reasons yup and sometimes it really is sexism
master is not without negative connotations some that cannot be mentioned in polite society and do not forget the negative nouns that apply only to men such as philanderer what shall we do with those what shall we do about the nouns and adjectives that have been used deliberately to abuse and denigrate groups within society words like fairy and darkie shall we pretend those meanings do not exist or have never existed
one of the great strengths of the oed has always been its descriptive rather than prescriptive nature now that the computerbased study of mindbogglingly enormous corpuses has become possible the study of collocation rests on ever more certain bases no one doubts that rabid frequently is collocated with feminist but the statistic that i have not seen the oed produce in its defence is the relative frequency of the collocation of these two words visavis its collocation with other words for example rabid rightwinger rabid communist rabid fan etc not rabid dog as mentioned in the comments section as that would be a literal use i look forward to their letting the world know what the statistics are viz in a corpus of nmillion words rabid collocates with feminist on m occasions with communist on p occasions etc
mostly round here its squirrels that are rabid
it was once used as a slur against homosexuals that the word was reclaimed is a good thing really so i agree if homophobic people hadnt commandeered the word to insult gay people then gay people would never have needed to reclaim the word
thanks for the etymology i was referring to modern usage but i certainly take your point i think both words are on their way out anyway
as are antracism antihomophobia and feminism cuts both ways
wonderful article my bugaboo is the contrast between emasculate and effeminate to emasculate is to diminish a man by reducing his masculinity to effeminate is to there is nothing wrong apparently with depriving a woman of her femininity there is no verb to effeminate but there should be as is its an adjective that diminishes a man by attributing to him feminine characteristics
i always have a giggle at madam chairman
i got moderated for typing n word really i mean not full version the actual in es n word i hope this one doesnt disappear but maybe it will japs is derogatory in the same way the n word is it was used for hateful abuse thats we dont use it
its a living language and the times are always changing i was brought up when it was acceptable to apply the word man to a generic person or men to a collection of people of no particular gender now most people dont do that mind you i think the british can and have made insults or euphemisms out of more words than most people imagine nudge nudge
not quite in the genre of pig curmudgeon prick dick head etc language is a great leveler of position and the most egalitarian of human abilities if we only care to learn one
fair enough i guess i just assumed you were addressing women in general with the victim card comment seeing as victim card kind of implies the holder would be the victim of in this case sexism not just anyone who recognises sexism my bad
but whatabout teh menz tho if you do have a brain somewhere beneath that rather prominent cock and balls perhaps you should engage it in a more careful reading of the article
japanese people themselves do not like the term their ambassador has told us this so really we shouldnt use it just as we dont call the scots scotch its called being polite
a good gender neutral term that we currently lackperson has always served me quite well though
actually if you look into the origin of bachelor we see youthful knight novice in arms someone with an implied career someone with some autonomy status and honour according to societal diktat someone of a higher class if you will spinster has origins in someone poor forced to do small scale odd jobs from their home because they have no support no autonomy no career or future as society would understand it so as the very least it is classist in origin if the words had equal status thered be no sexism
condemn a languageexcept the writer never did that did he in truth most of these words have been out of use for quite a whileno shit because this is an article about the history of the languagethe history of terms that refer to women shows how deep negative attitudes go
wag rake lad queer puff nancy loafer tosser wet whimp all terms for men that were not their original meanings nobody seems upset by this sexism works both ways or does it cant you find anything worth writing about other than this drivel
 gay has been commandeered over the past  years at least fifty years in common usage as a description of homosexual men promiscuous heterosexual males from the s onwards were described as gay amp its current usage evolved from there so its had a double meaning since before you were born i very much doubt you actually used it much in its original form anyway if youre really being honest with yourself vicar thats a simply divine flower arrangement so gay
and catamite
it is not a living thing therefore it is neuter
this whole article is lifted directly from a lecture in sociolinguistics delivered to me in  at manchester university the feature being used here was described as unequal lexical pairings the same words were used as examples too i still have the notes and used them when i taught english language a level women sometimes get both genders of an animal hurled at them a woman can be equally a bitch or a dog if a man is described as a dog it is often in a phrase which is in some way admiring such as he was a salty old sea dog whereas a woman who is a dog is of loose morals andor standards of cleanliness and presentation
theres nothing particularly thankful about language being gender neutral i think its utterly stupid for a woman to be called an actor or a princess to be called a prince or to abolish the words he and she if you take the argument to its logical conclusion women are quite capable of looking after themselves without all this pc nonsense and its thoroughly demeaning to tell them they have to adopt the male form to get anyway how sexist is that
using man to mean man and woman is the very definition of sexist no it isnt its the definition of the economic use of language to use humankind or womankind in place of mankind requires the superfluous use of an extra syllable
if you only spoke esperanto and not english it would
there was a tv show called the manageress starring cherie lunghi
please clarify
even woman really in anglosaxon a man could be either sex a male was a wapman weaponman and a female a wyfman wifeman whilst that is sexist enough it does have a good gender neutral term that we currently lack overtime man became normative and a woman a sort of qualified man
sorry i was just being a scamp
governess is a curious choice as the obvious one to make the same point would be manager and manageress a manageress typically manages a cafe a shop a hairdressers but if a woman ever got to rule the roost at the bank of england you can be pretty sure she would call herself manager
you use a wench to tighten a bolt while you use a skwewdwivew to tuwn a skwew
well this is certainly damning prose concerning the political incorrectness of the english language so well researched and presented an article can do nothing if not impress the readerwhy am i not impressed could it be because the whole precept is tripeeight whole words to condemn a language that includes in its lexicon words from every major culture on the planet and quite a few not so major ones i wonder just how many derogatory word can be attributed to the male sector of the populationin truth most of these words have been out of use for quite a while when was the last time you referred to someone as a trollop yeah the twerp missed that one
tramp
the idea that x isnt exceptional if y and z are similar is however of interest it helps put x in perspective
some think that the term japs is a derogatory term and should not be used but this is pure nonsense we adopt slang abbreviations of lots of nationalities does anyone thing brits is a derogatory term i doubt it the problem with the word japs is that there was a period when the word was spoken in anger and so to be politically correct we are being told that this is some sort of bad word not we must forever use the long formal version of the japanese nameor perhaps just until everyone who has ever seen a ww film from the s and s has died off slang for americans is yanks i wonder if the japs used that term during ww and if so do their speech police do like us and require obedience
because its a truism my guess is you are not deeply into etymology which is what is being discussed here rather than the history of civilization
yes those are all gender neutral
nevertheless it existsin fiction the yanks won ww single handed according to fiction so what we are talking about reality the trend of eliminating female suffixes that is now the normindeed thankfully we are moving to gender neutral its nothing to do with the suggestion of powerits entirely to do with that female versions of words are nearly always inferior to their male counterpart eliminating gender distinctions and just treating the person as a person not as male or female is a positive step forward for gender balance thats the point of the article
wasnt scot a form of tax and nothing to do with scotland you may be right about welching though
with all due respect i really dont think im missing the whole point of the oed im calling into question the oeds value judgement on what are to me essentially neutral words but which are presented in the dictionary with examples that suggest that they have a specific slant in everyday usei dont normally encounter that slant and hearing them is jarring so to me that is an unpleasant bias on their part and it wont be too much worse than it is today thats very comfortable but im hoping that things will improve on what they are today
yes plenty of indians would call gandhi a dictator and the emergency a dictatorship enforced sterilization co opting of national media and the massacre of political opponents sure sounds like dictatorship
my first collocation to pop was goes the weasel i must be a subliminal weaselword user 
why should they be kept for plurals and how is it clumsy many people if not a majority now use it automatically in spoken english and it is used increasingly in written english too im sure that any attempt to introduce a new madeup pronoun would be doomed to failuremany languages have pronouns which are multipurpose
and
for example although the japanese language does not use gender in grammar no one would say japanese culture is nonsexist the japanese are not really sexist they just seem that way
humanism egalitarian
all english nouns have a gender what is the gender of table
dont worry so much some languages attribute gender to every noun
shrill relates to high frequency sounds have we actually gotten to the point where its sexist to observe that women normally have higher voices absurd
what about describing a drunkard or a drunk personis the given examples inclusive of womenor hornyor bonehead
nevertheless it exists i agree with you that prison governor is probably used now for women as well but that would be in line with the trend of eliminating female suffixes that is now the norm actor instead of actress etc and words like authoress and even governess tend to sound oldfashioned its nothing to do with the suggestion of power
using man to mean man and woman is the very definition of sexist i feel like im in a twilight zone episode
the beauty of language is that we can see history within the words the words for animals and meat in english gives a good insight into medieval england the beef being french and eaten by the normans the saxons were not afforded such luxury usually only tending the animals should we be outraged at the word beef as it is oppressive to saxons no
yes but and feel free to disagree with medoesnt the use of bitch about males generally mean this is gangstaworld as i understand it a man beaten down by or under control of someone else ie occupying the position or status that a woman normally occupies in a gangsta relationshipso used to insult to a man by implying that he is no better than a servile secondclass human being ie a woman
has catlady been added to the dictionary yet
angry but not quite rabid they leave that to the feminists
our society has been patriarchal since adam thats what language reflects it isnt sexism how can you claim a patriarchal society isnt sexist with a straight face
youd be happy with a spinster of science degree then would you i wouldnt be unhappy i wouldnt go as far as saying id be happy as it is a matter of complete indifference to me male by chance
i cant see universities offering their female students degrees called spinster of artsspinster of science in the near future can you
im amazed brewster hasnt been hijacked to define a bearded craft microbrewery owner based in hoxton
canineaphobic you fell into his trap are youby any chancea feline
the lovely word to mean happy and carefree very simply expressed as gay has been commandeered over the past  years or so to mean something completely different
dutch cap
its utterly disgusting to hear such bigoted viewpoints from anybody even more so if its coming from a woman why is it more disgusting coming from a woman women can be just as bigoted as any man particularly leftwing guardian reading ones
yes nothing like a bit of bigotry to spice things up
yes when living in the black country s i noted that wench is used there in the same way that we use lass in lancashire definitely not derogatory gg
unless they lived in the black country where its still in everyday use
actually you are incorrect mankind is an abbreviation of human kind when it is lower case m then it is man or the human race when it is man with a capital then it equates to the male i think that is the right way around so how the word is presented and also its usage dictates what the word means it is not sexist except when people incorrectly declare it so
rabid dog

hark the shrill clarion call for censorship somewhere in the wind the objective of the oed in keeping with the principles of lexicography is descriptive not prescriptive if the corpus of empirical data indicates that rabid in its extended and not literal use collocates more frequently with feminist than with say communist or psychopath then so be it if the guardian feels strongly enough about the lack of some desired ideological slant in the oed project then surely it can petition campaign raise funds and so on for an alternative lexicographical endeavour the end product would be a an ephemeral compendium of politically correct gobbledygook for a socially privileged and lucrative market of the anxious and controlinclined it would be amusing to read such a dictionarys euphemistic wrangling around deeply offensive words such as she he fact actuality realism etc
i fully agree with your argument about mrs and miss and support the use of ms but im not sure what you have against the word spinster where i come from bachelor and spinster are unmarried men and women full stop so no sexism there and both are frankly a bit oldfashioned unfortunately society tends to stigmatise unmarried women as they get older but thats the fault of society not the language per se
sexism is like racism homophobia or xenophobia in that when inspiration fails it is a subject from which one can squeeze out an article
and so the same dictionary lists the emotive use of the word literally if one doesnt use words properly their meanings distort over time and since the population is way too stupid to use words properly and its not in vogue to say that said habit is a failing mark of lower intelligence or lack of breeding take what you get whats hysterical however is you trying to turn this into a feminist rant for sure fur sure
you linked me to fiction were talking about reality a google of prison governess suggests i include results for prison governor gee i wonder why excluding prison governor results only links a list of fiction in reality a woman who governs is a governor as in my real example of sarah palin why wasnt she a governess
you have not heard of biggus dickus he wanked most highly in wome
arise sir january for you are a true white knight
have the achievements of the feminist movement percolated down through the many layers of our language the feminist movement has a much shorter history than our language changes in language seem to be quite gradual things so i expect its going to take time to encompass equality changes
how many female dictators have there been we have not had as many female leaders as males however even within the tiny choice we have had gandhi and thatcher both of whom had the makings of a dictatordictatress
i dont think you are quite correct on the spinster one on my grandmothers marriage certificate she is described as both a spinster and a spinner being her marital status and her occupation respectively 
try and tell all those ladies that love their bodice ripper books that words like spinster hussy tart wench trollop and mistress are demeaning are you going to start a campaign to get rid of the masculine terms too like hunk stallion rascal handsome and bachelor
doctor is also a latin masculine noun do you call female doctors doctress
how they evolve illustrates society correct our society has been patriarchal since adam thats what language reflects it isnt sexism its history and lets face it the wench example is just silly at least we can hope that future etymologists will notice a change in the pattern from the th century onwards
i believe wench originally meant an infant of either sex
such blatant lies and you are a contributor most people now know only the radical farleft men hating feminists are given the oxygen of publicity as somehow they are supposed to represent the views of mainstream society when nothing could be further from the truth feminists always shut down debate when it suits them get people fired from their jobs who disagree with them and turn a blind eye to the real rape culture in rd world nations feminism is a total and utter sham and should be renamed to antieuropeanism thank you for providing the most perfect and apposite example of the point i was making
i used as did my friends and others wench in the south west growing up s agree that it was more affectionate than derogatory
to say sexism is at the heart of the language is bullshitis it though there are many historical words core to the language that showcase sexism some have died out some havent why was sarah palin leaving aside her politics for the moment elected governor palin rather than governess palin for example the male form has power and prestige the female form not so much its interesting and i believe important to understand why
all english nouns have a gender for example duck is feminine and drake is masculine these two genders apply to nouns that describe living creatures all other nouns are neuter gender functions only in language in life it is sex which is why official forms like visa applications ask for an individuals sex and not gender
once in elementary school a child came up to me in the playground and informed me with an arch smile that he had asked his father what the word nignog meant and that his father had replied that it was a person of african descent if you can understand why the report of that parents dry earnest wouldbe definition was all the more offensive and harmful then i think you can easily grasp why in the present instance an authoritative reference source should not permit itself to be in the business of reproducing demeaning portrayals of women on a related note the persistent white male kickback against every single public discussion of social inequality nowadays is proof of two things some of the members of this demographic are feeling sore further progress towards equality will be a war of attrition
feminism the belief that men and women should be treated equally you dont believe in that
dont know what outcontrollable means im certainly against the infantilization of women which the guardian brand of feminism seeks to do on a weekly basis the idea that women are delicate flowers and need special protection from words or slight transgressions is insulting to everyone an article in the observer last sunday link below by a feminist was a welcome change and greeted positively by most commentators httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejanpinkpremiumpricingretailerswomen
its a feeble response from oup and oxford dictionaries in the examples rabid fan and rabid supporter rabid is almost certainly being used in an affectionately sarcastic way so using those phrases as examples in the dictionary would be misleading more than that the statement that oup reviews all its example sentences to ensure they reflect current usage on an ongoing basis makes no sense at all as any of its lexicographers will confirm all the dictionary can do is look at past usage and record that
also dictionaries are constantly rewritten as meanings change thats how language works
i the article does mention that these are usages not definitions ii the rabid example was the one tweeted to the publisher and endorsed by them
i thought my definition was relatively sterile and unbiased i admit no such thing although i find it hard as im not sure what you mean definitions should reflect the current meaning of a word in its cultural context with no judgments passed
of course it only covers one usage its only applicable to the definition for that one example other uses would have different definitions which i assume they already have sorted although id love to see a definition and example of the word rabid being used in an affectionate context
actually forget all that bollocks and  all murderers are human recent research by snowyjohn suggests that  of british murderers are male a random illustrative example of a murderer in a british book being female would fly in the face of reasonableness
i was parodying jiangwenmings response to you
thought experiment my error sorry
okay my final minutes on this a its a though experiment no i have no such list but i know for a fact that a theoretical one exists unlike say a unicornb the list is very large lets imagine back to neolithic times and for the whole planetc even if you randomly picked  or  there would be a fair chance that theyd all be man if you picked a  the chances of getting a woman would be infinitesimal to to point of being negligiblec incidentally the victims would also be almost all male as for the adjective shrill why pick a human voice rather than a bird song probably male by the way and then why pick a female to illustrate a generally unpleasant quality murderers on the other hand can only be human and as i say they are just about always male bye
an example a single example from any published work ever in which rabid is used as a positive adjective i havent been able to think of one have you language is powerful more powerful than we like to think perhaps our words shape our thoughts even though our common assumption for everyday purposes is the other way round so im completely on the side of feminists and all who urge us to be more aware of the language we use and how it forms our thoughts the feminist objection here is the very fact that you cant come up with a positive use of the word rabid rabid happiness rabid equality rabid generosity its literal meaning describes the condition of having a fearful disease all other uses are therefore metaphorical a tremendously powerful linguistic trope because the literal meaning is carried over and remains active within the metaphor so attaching the adjective rabid to something implies that its to be feared as one would fear rabies its easy to understand therefore why feminists and all who are opposed to bias and discrimination object to the expression rabid feminist especially but not exclusively in a dictionary to avoid this problem lexicographers would need to come up with an actual usage involving something universally loathed if there is one its important to remember that this was just one example among many misogynistic expressions being used as examples in the dictionary some of which may be easier to replace but whether theyre replaced with acceptable alternatives or not discriminatory examples have to go
language always has been dictionaries jusr codify this
the dictionary publisher part of oxford university press was taken to task by the canadian anthropologist michael omanreagan after he noticed that the word rabid defined by the dictionary as having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something used the example phrase rabid feminist omanreagan tweeted about it to the publisher suggesting they change it heres a good definition of those actions absolute dick
are dictionaries now to become tools of social engineering
the oed distinguishes as it should between the two meanings of rabid and provides different examples so the adjective rabid to describe a belief is the word under discussion and the connotations of the word that means to be infected with rabies are not relevant here
fun fact the rabid feminists sentence in the oed which like the others is an example of actual usage not something made up by the compilers is taken from the autobiography of ann oakley a distinguished british sociologist feminist and writer wikipedia also congratulations to alison flood for i failing to acknowledge that all these sentences are examples of actual usage not stuff made up by the oed and ii speaking of the example sentence as though the offending phrases were the only examples offered instead of being a few tendentious cherrypicks from a much broader and more diverse range of examples
just found out this is a hoax well done guardian you should have checked your sources before publishing
to each her own
it doesnt have to be positive but it can be neutral which is equally nonnegative the proper sense of the word for instance affected by rabies objectively denotes a phenomenon with no negative connotations
i wish people would stop apologising after a twitter storm i dont think an apology is necessary what people are asking for is an update of the examples that refer to womanfemale in a not complimentary way in the oed in the old days he or other male pronouns were sometimes used to denote humans in general but today complaints about the patriarchy or sexism or any other such argument have led to more inclusive changes to words such as people he or she brother or sister etc most people would accept that these are desirable changes in stc society surely its time for the oed to rethink some of its definitions eg i would think that rabid doganimal would be much more appropriate and effective than rabid feminista rabid dog is a fact whereas a rabid feminist is a judgement or an opinion
most modern feminists are clearly not working for equality the definition you gave is an obvious red herring
most recent example should have been followed by of manhating apologies for the mistake
most recent example ltof manhatinggt sorry
women having higher pitched voices is sexist
canadian anthropologist michael omanreagan a doctoral candidate has just provided an sterling example that phd is an acronym for piled higher and deeper or in lessdisguised english he is full of excrement the oed explanations cited in this article may be stereotyped but they are not sexist they are examples of real world usagebut give the boy an a in selfpromotion and never a second glance for his anthropology
i do hope that we dont get any nagging daily telegraph readers
this michael omanreagan did he go oh man reagan in 
write everday sexism articles
what are we then to do with academics with big chips on their shoulders or perhaps simply dying for the publicity a comment or tweet about a politically fashionable issue triggers who would have even heard of the wellmeaning canadian anthropologist outside his particular scientific field had he not taken oxford to task did his tweet serve any really meaningful purpose one would reasonably expect more than that from a person of science
i accept that rabid can be applied to bibliophiles in a nonnegative manner but firstly it is the exception rather than the rule and secondly both sentences do not fit the subdefinition of having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something
are you sure he isnt a rabid oed fanatic
reminds me of a postcard i once saw drawn in s orwell style man tells daughter susan youre not being logical daughter replies i dont fucking care legend underneath susan suddenly saw logic as a male domination thing beneath a couple of crows wearing shades on a tree armed with tommy guns another reads the war of the sexes will never be won too much fraternising with the enemy
nagging adjective constantly harassing someone to do something
a nagging husband might
oh these wacky rabid feminists what will they do next
ah dear but the rabid pc brigade are out in force on this one ho hum
you wouldnt hear a nagging feminist say that
ive got a nagging doubt about that maybe if you changed your avatar
why on earth would a dictionary be sacred
what was the weird idea
bit dated though i prefer to worry about rank imbeciles
in what way
but it probably was  years ago which is when the oup get their news thats the real issue here
some people have far too much time on their hands
i do it myself i also understand the limits to its usefulness which is what ive been addressing above my original comment was admittedly a bit academic but i wanted people to step back from their assumptions and refresh their thinking and not to be in thrall to dictionary definitions which ask any lexicographer will only ever be a snapshot of the past
your intellectual honesty is far from verified
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvrqupxdhnge i guess nobody knows exactly but in my experience women do whatever they like so if there are fields like engineering it maths etc with virtually  males then its most likely because they women enjoy socializing over mechanical things rather than because they are scared off by mysoginy feminist christina hoff sommers did a good interview about how radical feminists have taken over academia and how they are running genderstudies classes in the usa httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjunafinvr also the reason why we get endlessly bombarded by everything is sexist nonsence is due to research which comes out of genderstudies where they believe that any difference between men and women is due to sexismhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvrqupxdhnge
oup enters st century with aplomb
my mother claimed that the male equivalent of nagging was always leaving a mess behind them for her to clean up again which was why she nagged one of my sons friends noticed that if a woman came into the house and saw say a pile of washing up in the sink she would set to and clean it a man would only do so if prompted
of course but occasionally its useful to check an unfamiliar word in reading or even more occasionally in writing
if youre writing a scientific paper youve already had to learn the language of that science which will not be the same as those of other discourses the crucial thing is that others in your field will understand you i remember hearing a particle physicist trying to describe the standard model in plain english and eventually having to conclude my paraphrasing its a shame you need to understand advanced mathematics to see this landscape because its beautiful
ok thanks for the links though surely environmental factors play a major part in personal choices
clearly this just proved the point of rabid feminist i am sure there are many entries including the female pronoun shall we have them removed for equality feminist is not a female pronoun it is a description of a nongendered political position that advances the cause of the female to be recognised as a human being entitled to equal protection respect and treatment under the law some consider such a basic position to be radical which is incomprehensible
a feminist can refer to both a men or women gender is not the problem in this example
i am engaged in an ongoing debate on this with my yearold son who refuses to understand why his mother hits the roof when he uses the word nagging to describe helpful maternal interventions re deadlines getting out of bed in the morning etc i would expect the term to be found in the oed and to be identified as derogatory demeaning insulting or some other blanket term to cover abusive language
ok be honest of all the words you have at your disposal how many of them did you learn from a dictionary and how many did you learn naturally from listening to others
well just like you can find other types slanders like the n word hysterical should be included with a proper definition to explain its context its normal that hysterical is appropriated to women its derivative of hysteria back when they tough our angry uterus would make us go crazy because humanity can be dumb as a rock sometimes
yes i used to call it semantic clarity but now ive evolved to calling it a georgeorwell
feminists are men also because the basic premise that women are recognised as human beings entitled to equality protected under law is a nobrainer it is incomprehensible how can anyone be described as rabid for work related towards the stated feminist politicalsocial objectives people are successful in life not because they know something other than the ability to manipulate words people can seek to attempt to convey a particular knowledge or try to achieve greatness in awareness or learning yet with the dexterity and plasticity of language all knowledge is lost and worthless to scientific advancement words provide the means for playground antics and political domination in crude reductive animal aggression of humans and cater a veneer by which the violent sadistic human might veil the true horror of the human inhumanity
lesserflorican isnt it time we abandoned dictionaries altogether linguistics has moved on since the th century and its now widely accepted that words dont have fixed meanings how could you ever write a scientific paper if this were true perhaps you are a politician
yes we interpret what we hear all the time a have a look at this letter from sally what do you make of it b cool trainers dude theyre sick man c well jonathan i was at that press conference and i have to say the president sounded pissed a a remark we might address to our closest friend b a remark we might hear from a young person c a remark we might hear from a us political commentator pissed in the us means annoyed and for us readers pissed in the uk means drunk theres the speakers meaning and the hearers meaning and theyll never be exactly the same we get by on close approximations but you must have experienced being misunderstood it happens all the time on these threads when i was young gay meant pretty or happy then it came to mean homosexual it began to transform again into a nonspecific putdown that shirts gay man like bastard which stopped meaning illegitimate when illegitimacy lost its stigma although that positive change reflecting the process of homosexuality losing its stigma was halted by an outcry from those who didnt understand the diachronic linguistics enough there are more pressing issues but dictionaries really arent much help when it comes to the current meaning of words
well yes but the context for this debate is the meaning of words in the english language so it is a fair descriptor
i agree they know full well the etymology of the word and its not positive
concombremalina dictionary like the oed is a record as well as a book to look up the current meanings of words in english is a sexist language as can be seen from the examplesthe grand old duke of york he had  men which means one thing ampthe grand old duchess of york she had  menwhich means something quite different the oed may become pc in future but i hope it will continue to illuminate the history of the language accurately ie without casting a pc veil over it
nagging headache ive never heard that usage actually doubt collocates but perhaps the oed has doubt and wife as its main examples if so thats still accurate
the dictionaries job however is to say how the word is used now it might be reasonable to comment on it but it shouldnt pretend usage is other than what it is
its
its a fairly common view amongst feminist academics she systematically picks apart the existing science about the brain to dispel what she believes is a growing assumption that men and women are wired differently from birth she argues that almost all of our characteristics are learnt she said in an interview with the guardian last year httpwwwtheguardiancompoliticsrealitycheckwithpollycurtisdecwomenchildren this documentary spoke to some gender academics at  minshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvplrdwxwampindexamplistllqfhwrgvvxevkvoniiq the entire basis behind genderas and positive discrimination and promoting the so called wage gap is based on their belief that women arent going into various disciplines due to discrimination or because of environmental factors rather than due to personal choices
well spotted mea culpa perhaps you will allow me use the word to refer to really bad tv
correction worlds premier british english dictionary
dictionaries recognise that words change meaning but the give us a handy imperfect reference point
isnt the dictionary caught its job is to reflect usage not to set it or direct it if a word like say nag is overwhelmingly used against women then the dictionarys example needs to reflect that
again i feel that the entry you e is justified in that it explains the otherwise puzzling etymology of the word this is how hysteria came to get its name it is not saying that hysteria is a specifically female problem but merely that this what was thought by the medical profession at the time it was named however i agree that your proposed addition of allegedly would improve it
well is it misogyny i agree that that as lesser florican says inclusion of the words sexism and feminist  would predictably cause the pc brigade to attack and perhaps the lexicographers could have taken greater care over the balancing of the gender of their example sentences but all the same it seems to me that such exquisite sensitivity is a bit ott who for example would take seriously anyone who complained that pennythems rabid dog was misandrous i feel that one of the concomitants of relatively equal treatment of women in modern british society should be a relatively thick female skin i suppose if they had wanted a genderless example they could have had a rabid tory
our point is that rabid isnt necessarily a negative adjective and that example sentence neednt be negative either our example sentences come from realworld use and arent definitions what an absurd statement from a representative of the worlds premier dictionary perhaps they can find an example a single example from any published work ever in which rabid is used as a positive adjective
more reasons why im not a feminist feminism continues to reveal its totalitarian colors
at least most of you could not be called rabid misologists
and therein lies the rub youve made the point succinctly for everyone being a feminist does not mean being rabid that people are encouraged to see it thus is not a good starting point particularly for a movement that is meant to be about equality
men are often victims of accepted norms hence we dont have enough male nurses or male primary school teachers men who want to take time off work to spend with their children risk being seen as a bit weird and not ambitious enough men who dont want to play team sports are excluded from social groups when we have a situation whereby our gender should not necessarily be seen as a precursor for how we should behave or what we get paid well be getting there
uh but words must have fixed meanings otherwise we wouldnt be able to communicate now on this forum unless i have misunderstood your phraseology or did i just write blahblahblahblahblah amp youve just interpreted it to fit your own sensibilities search me
not at all these examples are all quite sensible and should be corrected forthwith
its on par with men demanding the removal of the phrase manhating or the reference of typically by men in the oed definition of rape committed by a man actually and am i wrong or isnt it a matter of english law that rape can only be perpetrated by a man while if its a woman doing it its called sexual assault or something of that kind also the most recent example in the oed is from margaret atwood he thinks theyre a bunch of manhating hairylegged whiptoting feminists i suspect it wont be men who clamour the loudest for its removal once twitter gets wind of this
i think you mean shrill misandrists
gendered definitions with usage for the word nurse including he was gradually nursed back to health except this particular example doesnt specify a gender for the person doing the nursing only that of the person being nursed so not a very good example of the malepositive femalenegative assertion
pc gone mad 
omanreagan is a from the usa hes studying in canada
i guess it was only to be expected that inclusion of the words sexism and feminist would bring the reactionaries out in force
even the most rabid football fan  the funny thing is this is probably popular because generations have been mishearing  avid football fan
no problem as such so please say away but dont be surprised when someone makes the obvious point about the logic of your comment
ive experienced decades of changes to my own first language english and the meaning of words is documented in every piece of writing so im also informed by the history of english literature ive no problem with for example the oed documenting the history of the usage of words however the idea that you can learn the contemporary meaning of words from a dictionary is now outdated
well if you do not pretend that what is your problem with me having my say 
talk about whataboutery
is a dictionary a sacred object should it not evolve in time
how exactly did you come to believe that such an eventuality may be possible are you psychotic
true but there are so many and while i know an internet comment broad is not representative it is still just so depressing to see it play out like this so often
you clearly havent checked the source material you should try it sometime you might find it enlightening
dont agree with me youre sexistdont agree with me youre racistdont agree with me youre homophobic and so you go on hurling abuse while at the same time decrying abuse
you obviously dont believe in freedom of expression but this is cif ergo par for the course
i think you will find many more billionaire white guys than you will find billionaire black jewish lesbians that seems to be at least part of the the actual point although of course i agree with your first point but being gay does not negate the privilege of being white nor does being working class the privilege of being rich does not save you from the disadvantages of being female jewish or lesbian
backpeddling from backpeddling thats fairly impressive
yes freedom and responsibility are the same things
white males never have horrible denigrating things said about them excuse me but here on cif thats about the only treatment they get they seem to be the source of all evil especially in the view of feminist bloggers
you have to take the good with the bad any serious discussion about sexism on this forum will bring out the sexists same with racism and homophobia its inevitable
language has the power to construct reality language has the power to present views of reality
you obviously have no idea what political correctness actually means certainly not common courtesy someone please define it for people like this i havent got the patience
luckily the ownership of corporations is public do the names goldwyn and mayer mean anything to you
its called paraphrasing end of
lolado attempt to ignore the commentary below that supports your point while it is profoundly disheartening to read the tide of bile and bollocks that follows any article of this kind and while i continue to marvel at the lack of compassion historical and contemporary context of the average its all the pc brigade innit wanker there are also people in my life who i love and who love me who are part of the seething tide you describe i can only conclude this is due to genuinely different life experiences or missing brain cells it is a truly astonishing sign of our times
you only see backpedaling because you believe it should happen i do not backpeddle from anything
rap music has played a large part in normalising the term niggeryes because the word ngger was basically unheard of before the nwa started normalising it
good job you didnt add bald to that it would have been politically unacceptable otherwise
do we know each other because you make a lot of assumptions what facts exist that jews as an ethnic minority monopolize the media
a perfect example of the pc mindset incapable of objective assessment of facts due to rigid dogma
well there are several conspiracy theories which say that jews do run the entertainment industry there are also some who say that five jews live deep inside the earths core and control the worlds infrastructure sometimes you need actual evidence to make your point not rhetoric and wild accusations
immigration not integration
the purpose of political correctness is thought control and silencing dissent nothing to do with politeness that is simply what it hides behindfor example if youre all for unlimited integration you are quite free to say so conversely if you are opposed to it simply to express that opinion is deemed unpc and those ohsonice pc people to whom politeness and respect is supposedly so important will feel free to abuse you with impunity this is the hypocrisy of the left
i believe you used the word monopolise which implies something else but go on you backpedal faster than gary oldman
its usually the same social group white men why do they feel so threatened when their default mode negative linguistic assumptions are challenged because everyone of all genders and ethnicities have a similar default mode white men are held accountable due to their privileged position and in this case a white man stands to lose his entire career moreso because hes a public figure of course i have little sympathy for the man because im sure if he were to lose his career it wont leave him destitute oldmans over arching argument that its ok or acceptable in certain circumstancescontexts to act out the tropes of any isms this is the whole point of the polemic here that it should never be alright i agree that it never should be alright and the cost of that is eternal vigilance but oldmans stance from what i read is that people can be prone to a moments weakness a single moment and with a celebrity that single moment is most likely captured are we all able to say that we have never acted irrationally or had our internal politeness police shut off for a moment and done something we regretted not that its an excuse for it or does it diminish the crime we should always make amends for any wrong doing on our part but with celebrities these kinds of single fleeting moments haunt for years
so is it or isnt it
behind closed doors with your mates fine say what you like we all do this is typical of all hypocrites who defend double standards one for them and one for usme if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen in this context it means that life is tough and unfair and often unpleasant at best if you cant take life the way it is then you have one obvious choice and that isnt to tell other people how to think talk or act simply because you believe that what you think is good is what everyone else should agree is good and what you think is bad is what everyone else should think is bad that kind of policy leads only to tyranny which is what todays pc which like all other forms of pc throughout history started out with the best intentions is finally all about its too bad that all the worlds hypocritical and sanctimonious those who claim that theyre better than everyone else because they dont put their real opinions and beliefs on display in public but only behind closed doors with their mates tyrants want to execute the social as well as the religious apostates and heretics just what is it that makes people like you so much better than the rest of us runofthemill human beings
not a theory that jews own much of the media and are the pioneers of hollywood it is documented fact to say otherwise without evidence to the contrary is to be a liar or ignorant
as opposed to your jooish conspiracy theories look out there are jooz everywhere
i am not saying that hollywood being monopolized by jews is a bad thing youre all heart some of the more sensitive antisemites should put that phrase on an inspirational poster
have you a cogent argument i have not seen one just blustering bloviation
gary oldman showed how far antipc brigade sentiment has come or has it it seems that the main thing shown is that it is impossible to speak the simple truth the idea that facts are sacred seems to be under siege all over our western hemisphere i am not saying that hollywood being monopolized by jews is a bad thing but the fact that we cannot even discuss it though it is demonstrably true and books have been written about it means that we are free to believe that something sinister may be afoot
lennys view is we need more black actors appearing on the bbc nothing wrong with diversity itvs midsomer murders could use some colour maybe the producers will actually give minority actors some speaking parts if its allowed i mean i paraphrase but thats my understanding of the es i read perhaps you should actually read the article about him if youre unsure of what he said
persecution ofendedds oppression offendeds angry minorities offfendeddswho needs cogent arguments when youve got a catchphrase
how exactly do those like miss okolosie the author of the article control thought processes and attitudes is she a telepath like one of the mutants from the xmen and does she relay her strange powers through your computer or other digital device when you are looking at the online version of the guardian perhaps readers of the print version lose control of their senses due to something in the ink the guardian is printed on also the guardian has a circulation of less than  a miniscule proportion of the united kingdom population of  how does miss okolosie manage to control the thought processes and attitudes of nonguardian readers i see you believe that she would have everyone conform to a political dogma although you yourself appear to be remarkably untainted by whatever dogma miss okolosie is supposedly peddling this strongly suggests you have free will finally if you suspect miss okolosie andor other guardian writers of infiltrating your brain why not use that free will to just stop reading the guardian
we seem to have lost their insight in our timewhen people of colour were introduced to england things change grow up and deal with it
i realize gays are the only ones who ever got their feelings hurt from time to time we still get beaten up or even killed shortly after being called fucking faggots its not just about hurt feelings its about being put in fear of your life
there can be no doubt that the various media offendeds have become the new inquisition and they enjoy their auto de fes as much as their spanish predecessors did when they find a victim to vomit their faux outrage over but finally censorship is cheap and easy and a pretty lazy and stupid way of getting your point across perhaps the offendeds are so thick that they genuinely believe that by using the good old totalitarian tactics of suppressing comment they are actually expunging the ideas and feeling from society they are wrong being part of a racial minority or sexual orientation is not actually judgement worthy in themselves in society persecution of those so misguided to imagine that they in some way pejorative is only giving those individuals an actual cause that didnt exist before second the inevitable extremes to which the various developing offended industries must go to maintain the rage means that they inevitably begin to parody themselves thus risking looking more ridiculous than those they seek to anathematize finally for inquisitions to work at all they need a totalitarian society in a functioning democracy mostly they just get in their own way free speech logic and denying bigots chauvinists and homophobes a cause is the way to marginalize their ridiculousness rather than becoming ridiculous oneself that is not to say that the law should not guarantee every citizen safety in their own skin but minority vigilantism is counter productive no matter how much of an emotional rush it may be
nhscom or ukprisonservicecom lol
i really dont care if one is improved or not it is not about the feelings or the betterment of the speaker bigots can carry on whining and pouting all they want about not being able to casually trod groups of people under their heels anymore one doesnt get to use racial slurs cruel epithets or bigoted language anymore without expecting to be challenged because discrimination isnt just morally wrong it is just plain illogical welcome to the st century
the fact is that life is not fair indeed unfortunately for you bigger boys say you cant use words like nigger or kike its unfair but youll just have to suck it up lifes like that
gary oldman should come to australia where the right to be a bigot is enshrined in law
its a dumb comment because okolosie herself is clearly able to resist allowing her reality to be determined by what oldman has supposedly said how has she managed to achieve this and why is she so pessimistic about the ability of others to achieve the same level of discrimination in relation to the language that they hear or read
it fascinates me that there are so many abusive terms for gays women blacks and jews but so few for white men but then i guess thats just how power works so there are no white male gays or white male jews then is a parttime white male cleaner really so much more powerful than the billionaire black jewish lesbian who employs him
sapirwhorf hypothesis generally ignored these days reality is reality regardless of the language people use about it
did anders breivik teach you that stuff about cultural marxism he used to read the guardian didnt he he ed bits from it in his manifesto
so if i call you a boy that would have no subtext at all youd think nothing at all of it go ahead im not bothered by it at all should i be
and guess what the victims of racism decided they didnt like being referred to by the word negro or its derivative nigger get over it and stop whining about it negro is actually a derivative of the classical greek word for necro meaning death do you moan about negro not meaning death anymore
oldmans 
call me a putrid scrote and ill just laugh at you and wonder at your intemperance those who indeed are might not oldhams original remark in full context and his obviously ironic apology both bear more thought there is too much reaction here and not enough reflection on all sides
could you supply us with an example of the left using or even suggesting the implementation of the prosecutory power of the state to impose politeness and criminalise the impolite does the left have a policy to arrest and possibly charge convict and imprison anyone who fails to say good morning to others could you post a link to any such policy document i look forward to your reply many thanks
curb speech and you curb freedoms for some but you can allow for greater equality hence why hate speech and defamation laws exist no free society has to tolerate the intolerant thats a very authoritarian approach that society might start controlling speech that is intolerant of course we have to ask what happens when conservatives or the religious feel someone is being intolerant towards them let them outlaw said criticism no thanks i prefer freedom and that means allowing some people to say rude things really sad that such an authoritarian post became a guardian pick how things change
nice bit of guilt by association there well done
mel gibson still makes great films i would not want to invite him to a synagogue or be in the road with him after hapy hour but he makes great films
the funny thing about that was that the version broadcast was on a cd which was a compilation of s songs put out by the bbc
no it isnt
one can by changing the delivery and adding emphasis or sarcasm manage to convert a politically correct label into a much larger insult than the short but incorrect one you started out with one recalls basil fawlty and the dont mention the war technique
i wouldnt be surprised
the tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum maybe because this is something being forced down their throats and people naturally want to spit it out perhaps people have always rejected improvement being imposed on them from be it the supression of paganism or the collectivisation in the s in the soviet union or the joys of free markets in modern britain folk are contrary not like the guardian and its commentators would have them be
do you require in depth scientific evidence you obviously get confused when somebody states a personal observation or impressionby the way just wondering who the rest of us is exactlyyour wielding of the mail and telegraph using them as weapons against the evil right wingerridiculous and so wrong why would i want to read the pro ukip islamophobic right wing pressyou obvious like to make suppositions about people whilst crusading around the comments page if you actually read my comment you would see i actually stated i agreed with the articleif you disagree fair enough but perhaps next time you could produce the research which may make me change my mind 
as i pointed out in my reply to another posting martin luther king frequently uses the word negro in his famous i have a dream speech the word had no derogatory connotation at the time ive been on cif for a few years now and been called a lot of things but never a racist before but i suppose youve got to expect it sooner or later its always the last resort of people who are losing the argument
the right has consistently trounced political correctness but many adept rightwing politicians regularly use it to their advantage nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive luckily for us you are here to point out their political errors and castigate them for their crimethink
who is policing what people thinksay in a bar have you been arrested for thinking about something in a bar is this seriously something that has happened to you or anyone you know
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone and as the borg said resistance is futileresistance must be crushed so we can all be the same homogeonised humanity thinking the same with the same pc jokes and chatter oh brave new world that awaits us get a life
i agree and teaching good manners to children should be a function of parenting and not just left to teachers teaching good manners to adults however is patronising at best and at worst a foolish attempt at behaviour modification
note i didnt say agree i said recognise both men make controversial statements but only one gets attacked why should there be more black faces on tvthis is racism selection for employment on ground of race sheer hypocrisy
the monitors are usually selfappointed ninnies who take pleasure in catching people out sometimes they are journalists hoping to get an article about someones social gaffe or someone who has had one too many and actually says what he or she thinks rather than what they should think in businesses equal opportunity officers whose job i think is actually a valuable one frequently go over the top in advice on disciplinary issues especially in large and bureaucratic organisations teachers tend to overplay the pc speak and apply it to adults as well as their charges my feeling is that you probably do not work in the public sector or in a large organisation with significant equal opportunities input or indeed a significant hr group i may be wrong i often am
not me lennys view is we need more black actors appearing on the bbc because if they cant get roles in the uk then they will join a drain of black talent to america i mean i paraphrase but thats my understanding of the es i read
on what planet do you live where everyone uses these epithets in a friendly manner this is just another pathetic attempt like oldmans to justify a refusal to abandon the racist and sexist language of the past that made its users feel ohsocomfortably superior i have been called a faggot more than a few times in my life never in a friendly manner and a couple of the people who called me that got blood all over their faces
yes if you will it to be so
these are guardian reading liberal men i take it nuff said
i was brought up by parents who survived the second world war that generation and their parents who survived the first war took the line sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me ill take their steer on the issue of offence and hurtful words its a british value you might say they knew the difference between words and actions we seem to have lost their insight in our time
good advice next time i see a disabled person getting abuse in the street ill just ignore it and carry on with my day i dont want to be seen as an intolerant pc bully
many with a tough upbringing in the white working class will not agree with gary oldman so lets not stereotype the white working class and whats the comparison with lenny henry whose fan base includes black and white working class people he simply said he thought there should be a few more black faces on television hardly controversial gary oldman white actor says something offensive lenny henry black entertainer says something that isnt spot the difference
interesting idea fundamentally right in that the modern usage of the term originates in leninist dogma id love to know where you got this gem about the srs using it ironically it wouldnt be surprising since they were already being persecuted and subjected to show trials under lenin never mind stalin got a reference a date you should tell the oed their entry on this is poor
the view of political correctness as humourless language policing is so normalised it can be used as a cover for bigoted language almost all humor is based on violating some social norm or expectation
this rather misconstrues oldmans argument by ing his words out of context whilst at the same time rather ironically demonstrating the point he was trying to make theres a fair bit of contrived outrage in this piece and i find phrases like the rubric of free speech more sinister than his clumsy efforts to challenge political correctness
putting a label on someone does not change their views it only makes them feel they have no right to free speech im not following your logic because you seem to be saying that you want to have the right to put a label on other people but that noone has the right to do it to you because it makes you feel that your rights have been violated
pc language in someways has become a mask for the growing inequality pc language is simply a way of using language so the mainstream do not offend minorities racism religious bigotry and sexism on the other hand is the way our media elites and political elites can build false bonds boost digital markets and of course mobilise vote banks stop the boats and ditch the witch were just crude political chants to activate digit mobs and construct a shared notion of the mainstream by defining who to hate our politicians seek created a false shared political space us versus them this xenophobia is hard to construct in modern politics where our conservative politicians are constructing advantage for multi national and corporate pay masters who want access to cheap overseas labor via  visa etc what is sad is that the actual basis of post war australian politics was to extend opportunity and equality aboriginal rights and womens rights and other movements were not minority claims they were actually an extension of the bedrock notion of a fair go away from the pc battle ground of linguistic rules we see a growing gap between those with generous housing education and employment opportunities and those with less and less opportunities a us down under society is emerging and abbotts budget may not swear and demean minorities but it rips away funding and opportunity in a far more profound way in fact abbott uses the language of feminism to promote an expensive parental scheme while executing a class war in his budget on those on middle and low incomes needing material aid for education and access to affordable childcare the new bigotry of our fat cat political class is cunning and will coopt pc language when it suits their ugly agenda an unaustralian agenda that is to look after their political donors and increase inequality in australia
that sounds like a great workplace where should i send my cv
no he said that all people used racist and homophobic slurs did you even read the article
its a funny thing but when i call blokes putrid scrotes in times of anger they dont applaud me for my lack of pc they kind of take it personally and say stuff like do you hate all men i would have thought given their strident views about being able to take verbal abuse on the chin they would have been a bit more robust and stoic
its not complicated do you have this reply ready to be posted whenever theres an article about political correctness it might help your thought process to comment on the situation in question rather than a broad overview this is about gary oldman the next article will be about someone else
in the s my father ran a building firm the nearby hardware store was taken over by a man of asian origin to the men he had a totally unpronounceable name but it was something like suthanata our men shortened it to sooty we had an albino man who sooty called chalkey chalkey became godfather to sootys first child there was not a hint of racismjust a celebration of difference where have we gone wrong
thought crime is a reference to george orwells  and his big brother society where people are oppressed by words their writing and unwriting i do mind being called names im only human but what is far far worse is those people with power and influence who discriminate against and oppress minorities in essential areas of education health housing legal and employment the media etc silence on those matters but a hell of a hullabaloo on a bit of name calling i can ignore
no it didnt and malcolm x didnt like the word but it was objected to by mlk other civil rights movements and the naacp the media only really started to mention the objections to the term in the sixties but that doesnt mean there werent objections earlier you are also playing silly buggers when you know full well what the situation is around certain words dishonest and racist
is being called a nigger really comparable to being called fatty
i expect more from the man who repeatedly put his career his marriage his sanity and his own life on the line in order to protect gotham city from the forces of evil and corruption for almost the entirety of his adult life
did anders breivik teach you that stuff about cultural marxism
manufactured outrage
language seems to develop to accommodate things that begin to crop up often and require better description the sort of family relationships described in the article are outliers and nobodys going to learn a new terminology to accommodate them unless they become much more common
still accurate though
the current government was perfectly happy to collaborate with farages racist party to get the country to leave the eu come again ukip havent even got an mp at the moment
all cultures have a form of political correctnessthere was far more censure about language  years ago it was just about different things
as with so much in life it depends even knowing some basic information such as blood groups might rule out possible ancestors
few say cloured people nownot sure ive ever heard anyone say that at all but in seriousness the public castigation for anyone benedict cumberbatch for example who mixes up his coloured people and his people of colour and momentarily forgets which one is currently allowable and which one is a grievous sin is simply ridiculous
nieceinlaw
momi suppose it was inevitable like going to the fg prom
the chip on your shoulder is showing
as to the idea that this stems from a small minority who want to demand the world bend to their image from my experience some of those with the biggest issues or objections to the idea of two husbands or two mothers etc are those who object to there being others in the world that dont reflect their own expectations of what is right and proper wow thats a mouthful
few say coloured people now and the politically motivated black has come to be compromised by the term people of colour coloured people being replaced by people of colour is hardly on a par with developing opposable thumbs is it
one of you aint related to them and people doing a spot of genealogy yes that should be our priority in all of this
it does matter though it has consistently been found that children having no male influence father figure is damaging particularly for boys i would think the same applies to children with no mother figure although this is less common in family breakdowns
they also have a father or fathers although you have chosen not to allow them that relationship or title and factually speaking they only have one mother of course as they learn the birds and the bees there will be some confusion
i remember being considered posh at school because my siblings and i all called our parents by their first names when we were kids a teacher of my older brother actually raised it as a concern with my dad who told him where to stick his concern
the writers point surely is to explicitly answer the accusation of wishing to destroy the traditional family no the negative in nothing wrong gives the game away
its very simple we keep our traditional titles and you can make do as you see fit its not for you to demand change from others
their descendants will be confused one of you aint related to them and people doing a spot of genealogy are not going to be happy with two women on the birth certificate nor are people trying to find inherited diseases
there are probably better ways of putting what you write but yes society as a whole does see the two parent heterosexual parent as normal or perhaps normative
massive condescension is the only explanation for that preemptive rebuttal an alternative explanation would be that hes used as many people who have alternative family formations to being told that suggesting that a family doesnt have to be nuclear is seeking to destroy the concept
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family phew glad you cleared that up the guilt was becoming too much
yep and this scenario is not going to change
if youve adopted that way of doing things youre calling them auntie or uncle because you recognise they deserve respect or affection and have chosen to give that titleif youre an indigenous person calling an elder auntie or uncle the fact that they teach and rule on tribal law awards them that respect you wouldnt get away with calling a judge hey you and if they werent up to the task of being a good tribal elder the tribe would have dealt with them
quite im not married but i still prefer to call my betterhalf my girlfriend partner always sounds a bit like your embarrassed
whats cis anyway id never dream of asking such personal questions how utterly rude
despite what some are claiming here the reality is that there is an increasing amount of family formations that dont reflect the traditional nuclear families gay married couples single parents coparenting arrangements adopted children stepblended families heterosexual couples conceiving via assisted reproduction this is not a niche issue but one that is relevant to an increasing number of us and i think that as a result of that language and our perception of social institutions will evolve people are coming up with their own terms and the concept of biological primacy is being continually challenged and adapted whether through the extension of who can be registered on birth certificates samesex marriage parental responsibility being obtained by those who are not just biological parents and will continue to do so i think its not so much a matter of it must change but a matter of when will it as to the idea that this stems from a small minority who want to demand the world bend to their image from my experience some of those with the biggest issues or objections to the idea of two husbands or two mothers etc are those who object to there being others in the world that dont reflect their own expectations of what is right and proper
if you cant stand the heat
i think there its agreement through sense the not a man i meet results in a plural concept and he is known not to one in particular but to oneandall their common friend if you manage to dig out the chaucer it would be interesting
but if they were a boy and a girl they should not marry because they are half siblings it would be incest
the trouble is language tends to evolve organically and most attempts to manipulate it such as the french academy or esperanto have not succeeded however i agree with the basic sentiment
yep youve nailed it liberal authoritarism our language is a fruit of our evolution you just cant change the way we talk to favour a give ideology political correctness is a form of censorship too
it is a majority nearly half with dependant or grown up children plus cohabiting couples ditto also some one parent families will be relics of a heterosexual couple he didnt specify marriage only families
oh noes people breaking gender norms run for the hills
thanks andrew great article wellneededas long as we are all respecting accepting relaxed and human the language doesnt matter that much we cant force it as you demonstrated it will and does happen by itselfignore the naysayersfrom a single lesbian parent of adopted children and joint parent of a birth child
no evolution is a consequence not a need or desire to do something i think you need to read darwin again as a consequence of new more fluid family forms language must change it is inevitable however it is likely to be led by a combination of emergence and personal initiative choice few say cloured people now and the politically motivated black as come to be compromised by the term people of colourjudging by what you say linguistic change will take place wholly behind your back with little input from yourself which is a shame
not really no i imagine you in your daily life talk about what you want or should happen and manage not to be accused of dictating to others
preemptive rebuttal my butt it was a patronizing expression of the fact that hes perfectly happy to tolerate the way in which  of the worlds population lives who in their right mind would do otherwise so no preemptive rebuttal needed massive condescension is the only explanation for that preemptive rebuttal
nah nuclear families are still the norm despite the handwringing from a bunch of muesli munching saddos in islington
yeah we dont need you to tell us that come now we know that had that statement not been included the usual suspects would bang on about how he wants to destroy the family
maybe its revenge for you calling him bio boy although actually i really like that as a name do youwould you refer to a daughter as genetic girl
youve met my extended family 
just trying to
another way of looking at it is that relatively small numbers of people should not dictate to the majority about how they should speak and think not that hes dictating anything
but i think the point is that why biologically they may be related there is little to no connection there and they would not even know of this family were it not for a chance encounter i believe that to be true in a number of cases with the old style of halfsiblings sometimes a man would keep two families going at different ends of the country or just abandon one and start another the offspring are still halfbrothers and sisters though
well quite
when your descendants get themselves dnaprofiled because they are hoping they might be vikings or something this will become readily apparent surely it will only become readily apparent if the descendents also get him amd his partner dnaprofiled
i think he may mean heterosexual family which is monoracially white but i hope i am wrong evidence general tone of the article
nontrans works just fine
yes he is presumably meaning must be changed but wants to avoid sounding authoritarian
but they can only be used where the gender of the person is indeterminate shakespeare used they when he knew the gender theres not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their wellacquainted friend comedy of errors so does chaucer though youll have to take my word of it as i cannot remember a e not that shakespeare and chaucer doing something makes it correct necessarily just to show that this has been going on for a long time its not some new thing
yep people have often asked me intrusive personal questions that they would never dream of asking someone whos straight
thats the thing the engineers want intervention legal intervention ultimately
along with their infant mortality rates and their laid back attitudes to rape at least you wont have marital rape if you dont have marriage
its a pretty nonsensical headline surely because if something needed to evolve it would
rapidly abbreviated to jaux jauy and jauz which then evolve to maybe juxjay and juz but juxxy juzzy told me i could
i think gender is society defined sex is physical resulting odd notions of how men or women behave are all over the place because of social stereotypes for example people have an attitude that writing poetry is a female activity despite most poets being male ditto any artistic activity or the desire to wear flamboyant or silky clothes try this lot of stereotypical idea on someone like marlowe a poet and possibly flamboyant dresser among others
homer simpson welcome to cif
i just find it interesting that lately anything outside the norm is immediately shouted down by yes the professionally offended the author has made the mistake here in providing ammunition for them with an illconsidered sentence that same e has been lifted half a dozen times already and criticism of it upvoted by the masses so well done in playing along
no
thats a very good idea the article gave me a headache trying to follow the mommy mummy mama daddy papa scenariosi do get the point that language hasnt kept up with changing social situations but this article didnt shed any light on the problem i think the problem is that the article isnt clear as to whether its about the terms a family uses internally and the terms used to identify relationships from outside the family
explaining a wider distribution of responsibilities among biological and nonbiological parenting figures carries the risk of similar ostracism in our ecstatic embrace of the nuclear family we are told that a child needs a mother and a father i know of children of single parent families both single mothers and in one case a single father who are of the opinion they would like to have had both a father and a mother i also know of children of single parents who never think about the issue
and before i get accused of sexism when my daughter is in her s i will not be pleased if she is dating someone my age even if we are likely to like the same music and remember the same old football matches
i am not a fan of the state taking over either but as i said elsewhere in response to another post which in part answers what you sayyou posit the state and biological family unit as in some way opposites but this is not really true the state both supports and undermines biological tyranny for example it will remove children from biological homes to place in foster homes if it feels those children are being abused or neglected similarly it will insist a biological father or mother is financially responsible for a child until a point when the main carer usually the mother enters into a state certified marriage with a new partner but yes the state takes as its default position the biological unit and supports it as best it canhowever there is now increasing complexity families always were complex as the dominant narrative of the post war nuclear family is declining in favour of more fluid relations which predate the nuclear family where blended families and more communal support structures were also prevalentthe reality is that individualised childcare gives great power to the state both hitler and stalin were great fans of the superstructured nuclear family anti gay making divorce difficult 
same here there are no aunties or uncles in our family just people with their own perfectly adequate names 
as well to leave this kind of thing alone as tinkering is likely to create a mess and before you know it bobs your aunty and fannys your uncle
theyre adults who presumably play a role in your upbringing and deserve respect and often affection its just easier what if they dont deserve respect or affection
i would have thought it would be practical and appropriate to have terms that describe the types of relationship we actually have rather than those we might wish we had also fail to see what bearing the population size of china and india would have on what terms english should use
interesting article i note you call your partner your husband so clearly you see him as the head of the family well maybe i am making as assumption because thats what we use nouns for labels for boxes of assumptions when i became an orthodox christian i came across the concept of spiritual father and it has shades of meaning for us that are probably absent for most english speakers my assumptions as to what my brethren mean by it will probably not be the same as yours brethren is an old word too not used much today its roughly the same as the invention kinsperson and has no sexual connotation nor even describes the closeness of the relationship except that it is closeish i find that i agree with the article concerning the language i cant condone sexual relations outside of marriage of course we do need new words that dont carry the baggage of the past i loved maddy maybe we should use paddy for spiritual fathers they are usually priests
yeah the race part was bizarre glad others thought so just pure divide and rule
just merely highlighting that simply pronouncing something correctly doesnt make it acceptable to use
so they came up with maddy if thats what works for that familyunit then thats great for them you dont even need to be nontraditional maureen lipman and jack rosenthal were known as mod and dod by their small children apparently i dont see anything wrong with uncle aunt and cousin being used loosely my wifes brothers son is my nephewbymarriage but thats a bit clumsy his halfsisters wifes brothers partners children from a previous marriage are what niecebymarriage once removed thankfully they are all adults now so we can use first names equally
yeah the race part was bizarre
lourdepaul h ago said language will evolve when theres a societal need for it to andor when some one or more people come up with new wordsterms that are catchy enough to stick and enter the general language
indeed as another irish person i can agree the power to remove children from their parents should be the most supervised and accountable power that there is it should never have an ideological agenda why should we presume that children are better off with their biological parents than with anyone else thats exactly what we must presume unless we have a very strong case for believing otherwise we should certainly not presume that those in power know better
i think what psodal is saying is this sorry if i am mistaken psodal the author of the piece seems to be asking for new terms to be invented to cover new family relationshipspsodal is saying that in english new terms are not imposed from above by some language committee but are invented by common users of the language and either catch on or dont like texting sometimes proprietary brandnames also become new words like googlingso yes of course our language changes all the time to include necessary new words but there is not really a way we can ask for these words we cannot write to the editor of the oed suggesting they come up with a term we think there is a need for instead we all use whatever words we think are most appropriate and the best ones will eventually catch on my sisters girls call her by her name or mum they refer to their biological mother as tummy mummy which i quite like
huh not sure what your drug habits have to do with the conversation as it happens they wereare excellent parents and hes a fine young man with a very successful career
this is absolutely true in gujarati you can distinguish between a female cousin who is your maternal aunts daughter from your paternal aunts daughter and so on down to quite distant cousins if youre a hindu these relationships also show where you cannot marry exogamy is the rule you cannot marry you cousin because her relationship to you is considered to be that of sister routinely cousins are addressed as bhai or ben brother or sister usually with forename in front eg ilyaben
lets have a fiesta of new vocabulary for these new forms of relatedness how about a macron for the situation where you are married to a woman old enough to be your mother cant see the habit catching on somehow
well said have a recommend from me
whats wrong with cis we need a word that is the opposite of trans
too right only blood can wash away the stain of dishonour ah sorry wrong century
to be honest the boot isnt on the other foot nobodys agitating to oppress oppositesex marriages i think the line the op is objecting to is bad writing more than anything political
speaking as someone who has no living relatives i simply refer to myself by the familial term one lucky bastard
oh look another book plug from someone who seeks to tell us how to think and to think the guardian used to be a newspaper rather than a mouthpiece of social justice norms we dont need your approval to know that there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent family most people understand that at an instinctive level and yeah ive taken your monoracial sentiments out it has no place except in your race baiting world where everyone is defined by colour rather than character
true people must be happy they must be made happy in the following way by following the dictates of guardian journalists glad we cleared up
you are number six
another way of looking at it is that relatively small numbers of people should not dictate to the majority about how they should speak and think the vast majority of people are still the offspring of a male and a female who had heterosexual sex
you posit the state and biological family unit as in some way opposites but this is not really true the state both supports and undermines biological tyranny for example it will remove children from biological homes to place in foster homes if it feels those children are being abused or neglected similarly it will insist a biological father or mother is financially responsible for a child until a point when the main carer usually the mother enters into a state certified marriage with a new partner but yes the state takes as its default position the biological unit and supports it as best it canhowever there is now increasing complexity families always were complex as the dominant narrative of the post war nuclear family is declining in favour of more fluid relations which predate the nuclear family where blended families and more communal support structures were also prevalentthe author merely wants to embrace that complexity and not promote the colourless dystopia you have invented for yourself
so true
you are their uncle or aunt since your spouses nephews and nieces are yours too divorce makes it a bit difficult am i still related as uncleaunt to my ex husbands nieces and nephews who are my childrens cousins i think the relationship probably still applies as we have a biological connection
why do so many articles articles in this newspaper insist on telling us what must happen and what people must do and what society must do a strange desire to improve our society and peoples lives you may not agree with their suggestions but its pretty obvious that theyre trying to make some unhappy people happier
im with you yesdear its the obvious and simple solution my children started calling me by my given name when they were about  or  we spent a lot of times at festivals and in that environment calling mummy was not helpful  women turned round calling my given name made much more sense my eldest had the idea and within a few months it was all they called me they are now in their s and still use my given name strangely my daughter was talking about it to her  year old this morning and he said he felt he was still too young to even call her mum and wanted to carry on saying mummy i absolutely hate the using of aunty and uncle for anyone in our extended family the terms mum dad nanny and granddad are the only ones used every other adult is known by their given name it makes life much more simple love respect and the actual relationship are not determined by a specified word you use but actions
brothers and sisters have i nonebut that mans surrogate maddy is my second primary parents son
how about numbered villagers as it does take a village etc on a serious note language is a shared communication mechanism for which a degree of papering over subtleties provides a massive increase in utility you managed to e plain
exactly my thoughts language will evolve itself as and when there is a requirement the actual words used are not the problem here it is the societal presumption of ideal family that is in question and inventing a new name for a surrogate mum or a sperm donor dad isnt going to fix that language should be left alone to evolve except where loss of apostrophes is concerned
wow thats top notch parenting there if he pronounces cocaine correctly would they let him use it
i agree i dont see a sensible alternative to existing laws around financial responsibility for children whether planned unplanned wanted or unwanted there is an imbalance here though choice lies only with the pregnant mother but longterm financial responsibility lies with both i am also not a fan of the state taking over responsibility from the individual including and possibly most importantly that of childcare the end game of that approach is involuntary state sterilisation and state control over sexual relationships a brave new world indeed
how does your partner feel about it
this is the vast majority of most families in  there were  thousand families in the uk  thousand were married couple families with dependent children a further  thousand were opposite sex cohabiting couples with dependent children there were  lone parent families with dependent children and  thousand married couples with no children there were  thousand opposite sex cohabiting couples without children overall  of families cleave to the model of two heterosexual parents married or cohabiting with dependent children another  have non dependent grown up children so its not a majority even if you count the families with grown up children who have moved out httpswwwonsgovukpeoplepopulationandcommunitybirthsdeathsandmarriagesfamiliesdatasetsfamiliesandhouseholdsfamiliesandhouseholds

if a driver wants to go to the centre of town ____ needs to turn left at the lights if a driver wants to go to the centre of town they need to turn left at the lights so whats the problem here
i dont think so i know german best and it is still necessary to say lehrerlehrerin to distinguish malefemale including in job adverts this is much more than in english where many feminine forms like actress have fallen from usage then of course we have the frau hat gesagt discussion which is a bit like the herstory discussion in english
the history of the word they itself indicates what criteria have to be met for a change like this to last the word they along with other th third person plural pronouns mne their them entered old english from old norse and replaced an existing set of third person plural pronouns that like oe singular third person pronouns began with h so for example the old english form of them was him the exact same form as the singular third person pronoun the change began in the areas of the danelaw and became widespread because it made it much easier to distinguish between singular and plural among third person pronouns and that i would argue will be the deciding factor here does a change like this add greater clarity to what a person is saying if it does it will stay if it doesnt it wont
social and grammatical gender are actually unrelated things grammatical gender is simply an arbitrary effect of the way languages elvoved it has nothing to do with social gender oppression they are two different concepts which share the same name basically due to the conventions set up by nineteenthcentury philology which classified indoeuropean words as masculinefemenineneutral rather than as say abc arguing that changing words will improve anybodys lot is delusional it is like arguing that the verb to sing oppresses the verb to play because the first is strong and the second weak
ms munir is going to be a world class pain in the arse
no it is not a doctor is orvos male or female a firefighter is tűzoltó male or female there are not even separate words for brother or sister merely testvér sibling there are honorifics or bácsi male and néni female but these are usually attached to given names which would often gender identify anyway traditional marriage name taking was pretty sexist but this is dying out among the young previously the woman would take her husbands entire name eg monika kiss marries ferenc fekete she could become ferenc feketené woman of ferenc fekete i agree with adriango language here may be genderless but sexism is well established
its the web they want
youre right kiz but this isnt change singular they has been in nonremarkable use for at least  years its just the purist logicians that claim that its new which for them is enough proof that its a mistake
i was just supposed to understand that language excluded me because i was a girl i was out except when it came to naming hurricanes and referring to ships but i dont know of any objects that are referred to as he so this doesnt make sense also the rise of transgender celebrities might better e replaced with a certain media fixation with transgender celebrities
you wouldnt say i saw daniel earlier they said they were doing fine it just doesnt flow surely no one is suggesting that but someone has left their keys behind is useful clear and surely in the year  unobjectionable to all but the most obdurate dogmatists
see above at least to the polyglot doubly so for myself since in my native dialect hen is most definitely not genderneutral when applied to people even in some swedish dialects it will be pronounced closer to heyn rather than henn just sounds awful
they is a plural pronoun and as such is not appropriate when doubling for a singular noun i remember even  years ago things like each pupil is responsible for their own books if you dont know whether thats a boy or a girl ask them
ive always used they as a genderless singular pronoun i didnt know it was controversial
plural used to be the plural form but is now ie last several centuries used for both exactly the same as they since at least shakespeares times so yes they is the most often used and thus correct genderneutral third person singular personal pronoun in english that said the whole idea that meaningless labels for semantic variables which is what pronouns are make the language sexists is loopy
the guardian keeps wondering why it is mocked on social media this is another reason
the author should also look up the word concise i quit reading after  words
itt this doesnt affect me so why on earth would anyone ever care
im male and have been using they as a preferred pronoun where gender is not relevant for as long as ive been able to write just because it sounds better to me im aware some people regard the pronoun he to sometimes refer to both he ampor she but i think they is just as usable pluralisation can easily be derived from the context people tend to get up in arms about incorrect use of the plural they but i think that they need to get their old fashioned heads out of their arses language is will be and always has been everevolving
not sure of the grammatical explanation but if you take the following sentences and substitute one you see why it doesnt work at the start of  the good folks of the american dialect society got together to crown their word of the year one see what im doing here have decided that the word could now be used as a singular pronoun flexing the english language so a plural could denote a singular genderless individual
i suppose a lot of grammar purists would be up in arms but it seems sensible to formalise this colloquial use of pronouns as the article shows it would solve a lot of awkwardness it has been recommended by usage guides from reputable publishing houses including the oup since the s
nit picking
at the start of  the good folks of the american dialect society got together to crown their word of the year they see what im doing here have decided that the word could now be used as a singular pronoun flexing the english language so a plural could denote a singular genderless individual yes we see what you are doing using the correct plural pronounthat is theyin conjunction with your use of the plural folks in the previous sentence not exactly sure why you needed to point that out though
i cant speak for the entire  years but i was taught to use the singular they  years ago and both my parents used it i find it hard to imagine that we used some unique dialect
they is the correct pronoun for a person of undefined sex efl textbooks for teaching english to foreigners have been agreed on that for years and years and all state that he is completely incorrect and he or she is awkward and oldfashionedive always used they in these cicumstances even as a boy in the s and everyone spoke like that as far as i can rememberenglish is not a grammardriven language the ideas and context are more important than in languages like spanish english speakers also use they and plural verbs for singular words expressing ideas of a group of people the committee are meeting is prefered to the committee is meetingalso unless you want to sound as if you are a th century timetraveller whom and the subjunctive i were are disappearing again modern efl textbooks state that whom is unusual and normally only seen in written english that native speakers prefer who for accusative and dative forms and that i was is fast replacing the subjunctive i were language is a living thing it adapts or better put it is a tool that the speakers adapt as required
dear person your gender does not concern us punch being ridiculously sarcastic about j s mills proposed amendment to make the  parliamentary reform bill genderneutral which would have given women the vote hence the horrified sarcasm by the male establishment httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilemills_logic_jpg in most situations in life a persons gender indeed does not concern us
no going a bit too far
funnily enough we can comment on this sort of thing
she went with her to see the ship being christened she said to her afterwards that she looked magnificent but she wasnt sure that she was ever going to leave port how is that any clearer
the two are not mutually exclusive
the fact that someone can earn a presumably comfortable living writing execrable nonsense like this gives me a sense of doom far greater than the supposed climate change does i visualise some hyper civilised roman writing something similar just before the fall of the empire
it heshe manwoman person who honestly cares
woman in finnish is nainen clearly related to hungarian nő but its also related to concepts of marriage and fucking naida can mean both marry and fuck the romanticism is a bit of a stretch not sure if férfi has a current cognate in finnish
during a party leader election recently i heard the bbc presenter studiously say that when the new leader was elected they would all very correct and making sure the necessary boxes were ticked but of course completely nonsensical which is obviously a secondary consideration in some circleshaving said that maybe it was a clever reference to the twosided nature of politicians
so people from america want to try amp tell others how to speak my countys language may be firstly they need to stop using insulting derogatory terms like folk get that sort of thing right first amp in the future we the english might listen to their ideas about our language
also in english even though they are not assigned a gender the sun is generally regarded as masculine and the moon as feminine although there is said to be a man in the moon in paganism and celtic mythology the phases of the moon are seen as the maiden the goddess and the hag not terribly polite but it isnt my term
if they got a transgender doctor do you think theyd be satisfied
so what was the feminine nominative plural in old norse
what do you suggest for all of the other languages which have noun classes that distinguish between male and female possibly among many other distinctions its not a plot you know had english evolved from chinese say there would have been no he or she just ta but oh dear in writing new forms of ta have appeared to be understood as female or divine but still pronounced ta
imo could of is mainlydistracting in informal written english
urk im talking about pronoun use and i use the wrong pronoun murphys law all pronouns have suffered from ambiguity and we deal with it
never can understand how englishenglish doesnt get around to using yous i suspect snobbery is at the base of it both for english people in general and for nonworkingclass scots you is the plural form and in common with many indoeuropean languages is also the polite singular its just that in english the polite singular ended up being used all the time the singular is thoutheethine i am guessing that the scots form yous is the new thing following the normal route of adding an s to make a plural like how brothers replaced brethren not the englishenglish form being stuckup
how old are you under  years old well theres the explanation for your amazement for others of us there is nothing amazing about it our amazement is that this habit of the singular they is now run amok
well i certainly do understand what is being discussed and i agree with claretjimmy
try google its at wwwgooglecom thats a web address and is called a search engine
that does not necessarily follow what they seem to be commenting on is its lack of importance for an internationally acclaimed newspaper its more a comment on the woeful state of the guardian rather than the burning need to use a common word in a way which is already widespread
it makes me wince every time i get a notification from facebook that bob smith or sally brown has updated their status
you dont understand what is being discussed
my hip dictionary is the oxford university press dictionary of english it says they singular used to refer to a person of unspecified sex my chambers and the online cambridge agree in fact im not quite sure where im going to find a suitably unhip dictionary that says otherwise
inherently associated with hmq and that really wont do
all pronouns have suffered from ambiguity and we deal with them this isnt an argument against using they as a singular allgenderembracing pronoun
one can use this construct when the person is undefined but in other circumstances it doesnt work if a driver wants to go to the centre of town ____ needs to turn left at the lights of course theres another solution to this a driver wanting to go to the centre of town needs to turn left at the lights i guess the question is how unpleasant is the use of they in the singular how great a length should one go to avoid it personally i avoid it most of the time but i dont have a problem with other people using it its a perfectly reasonable substitution for a word that is simply missing in english
are you a nonfemale by any chance
why is it inherently sexist to have different pronouns for males and females are we automatically assuming the poor females are the longsuffering victims yet again is the female pronoun in some way more demeaning than the male oneat least english doesnt have the tiresome practice of assigning genders to genderless entitiesi think the g is really scraping the barrel on this one
so you want to restructure the english language i guess that will mean having all the great works of literature amended so they comply with the new rules as many of the authors are deceased well just have to take it upon ourselves to make the alterations but i think this will pass you might just be having a bad week
would you say if i were you is clearly wrong yet it breaks the rules really i was taught that that was the correct way to say it subjunctive mood and all thathttpsgrammarpartyblogcomifiwereyouandothersubjunctivestumpershttpwwwenglischhilfendeengrammarif_i_were_youhtm
surely there would be occasions when one would need to know when the reference is to men or women they avoids this seems like correctness going a bit too far i have the greatest respect for women for it is they who bore the human race and in certain respects direct it as well
they are grammatically genderless but not genderless as such its still perfectly possible to refer to men and women in both good and bad ways
things become a little more tricky when you start using every and any which more often than not suggest more than one person might be consideredhere are two examples from sylvia chalkers current english grammar will everyone please bring their passports with them andif anybody calls tell them i am out this by the way has nothing to with sex or gender
it wasnt in common use for  years or it should have already been natural and normal usage long before anyone now living was born but thats not the case
what do you mean by you need a specific for plurals and by you do you mean me or people in general
yes she will
as a man i find this attitude totally unacceptable he is only perfectly acceptable to refer to a male person such as myself or yourself marmaduke and i always use humankind rather than referring only to the male section of the human race a good and wise female friend gave me a hint once she and i are both frequently involved in writing speeches for public utterance about using nongenderspecific language it should not if at all possible draw attention to itselfusing the composite heshe fails in this regard because the reader or listener is immediately alerted to the fact that you are being deliberately nonsexist the fact that english has used genderspecific terms for the last  years is not an excuse for going on with the discriminatory practice except in the north of england people who speak english no longer use thee and thou i imagine when the use of you began there were people who objected because thee is perfectly acceptable but it is in the very nature of language to keep improving
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate taken from a guardian article last year
should one use the singular or plural form of the verb where they is used in place of he or she my concise oed says that it is now generally acceptable to use they to refer to a person of either sex it gives the following example anyone can join if they are a resident shouldnt it be  they is a resident
oh but in the groaniad it is
gods a hit see above by andrew n smith
call him or her it youll soon find out
they is preferable to he or she or she it is also preferable to the traditionalist he ultimately the court of language users will decide
colleague singularthey plural possibly this would make a spouse suspicious i suspect
all small problems should be ignored until the largest ones are gone thats guaranteed to work isnt it
explain the first part of your comment the bit where you swapped man for woman and then nothing happened but you felt you had refuted the argument
is there any serious resistance to it being used in this way my hand is raised yes i oppose it i oppose it seriously and in every other way i was born and raised in a time when no selfrespecting native english speaker should have used that construction a time when had i said that any responsible adults within earshotmy parents or any otherswould have corrected me on the spot and would have expected to have been thanked for their interest and concern rather than told to mind their own business using they or their to refer to an individual was then considered an indication that one had never learned proper grammar in those days people could actually take pride in their knowledge rather than in their ignorancefor which latter people were actually known to feel embarrassment yes i know these things sound incredible but i swear theyre true
but thou thee etc are gender neutral perhaps its time to bring them back
how can you tell when someones from yorkshire theyll mention it in the first two minutes of meeting them
i agree with a lot of this we need to remove inherent prejudice from our language but they has long been used in the singular in english but not to denote genderlessness i cant substantiate this with empirical evidence but i think youre wrong here they has been used precisely to avoid saying he or she for a long time its a bit clumsy as i wish we had a alternative but any other way tends to draw attention to gender rather than obscuringignoring it alternating he and she is just distracting and any created word zhe sounds like it is a statement of queer politics nothing wrong with queer politics but neither he nor she is different from either he or she so they it is but since when is this new
is this something you copied from the movie the oxford murders 
uptight and cannot deal with any thing that hints at sex
not available to ask
oxford dictionaries defining the word rabid with the example a rabid feminist or housework with she still does all the housework i am completely on your side in this debate but do not spoil your argument with such carelessly wrong statements oxford dictionaries does not define the word rabid with rabid feminist it uses that phrase as an illustrative example this was an unfortunate choice and should be changed but it is not part of the definition the same goes for what you say about housework
plus lots of people already do this this is the rules changing to reflect common usage not the other way around
when i next find myself conversing with an old norse speaker ill bear that in mind
english is lucky the swedes have had to invent the abominable hen to cover a genderneutral pronooun whats abominable about that sounds remarkably inoffensive to me
youve successfully destroyed an argument that nobody was making well done
because it looks st and it takes the flow out ouf sentence i use they
meanwhile some women cant leave the house without a mans permission are stoned for adultery or have their genitals mutilated
or if one just works a bit harder in school one can drive there in a nice car
one works very well in both english and in other languages but the leftist will say it is classist id like to see the formal and informal returned to use in english
sorry what is the problem with one
in the os at school we were taught to use they for impersonal situations the equivalent of on in french and man in german in my adult life i was always surprised how radical this was perceived maybe my small northern comprehensive was ahead of the field on this subject
isnt that because there isnt a distinction between the two in english as far as im aware you only used gendered words in english to refer to natural gender or assign gendered characteristics to a nongendered object eg ships and storms
tha would say that wouldnt tha
yes but the discussion is much less uptight than the  newspeak in the uk and it does make some job adverts look crazy nurse might be better in english if it had a male and female form as today it all to often means a woman how do my kids know if to expect a woman or a man for a teacher why dont they insist on dropping both mr and ms in names
god is a gas
what is the problem with one
the other day a chinese colleague said that they represent good by combining two symbols girl and boy its not quite girl and boy the written representation of hao is actually a combination of the radicals for woman son which puts a slightly different historicalcultural slant on things
yes you have put it well and more politely than i would the sentence i would write would be weeping millennial laying bare its soul to an audience is it a millenial which will now get moderated
i think the only problem is that it sounds wrong we pick up most grammar by listening to others rather than through rules they was commonly used as a plural pronoun so sounds a bit weird used in the singular but as you say the arguments in favour of its use far outweigh that minor niggle
talking about language as if it remains stable is ridiculous shifting the goalposts might seem like a noble goal at the time but it will seem like waste of time  years down the line when its all changed by itself again there is no progress to be made here just imaginary progress the next generation will never want to talk like the previous one and this has nothing to do with the sexes
well to a certain extent its all a matter of opinion the author is ok with ladies personally i would never call women ladies from a guy it sounds either like a bloke from the bowls club talking or a latin gigolo depending on how its said
and not just for women by men derbyshiresouth yorks blokes often call each other loveduck etc
i can also assume that women will stop referring to each other as girls because its patronising to each other women over the age of  should defer to comments such as im going out on the town with the women or im having a women night in etc
behold the language police
because youre not fat
woman sounds shocking in a scottish accent
too truewomen keep calling me ducki rather like it even though i am not a duck
you seem to spend a lot of time in your local coop chatting to the romanian woman but to answer your question okay to call customers love as she doesnt know their names and has no relationship with them but not okay to call the manager love as she does know herhis name and has a work relationship with herhim plus makes no difference whether the customer or manager is a she or a him easy difference to understand by most people id have thought
his reference to fruity little tarts is undoubtedly forbidden too
pupils obviously
the article was far more balanced than the title suggested and that programme was really interesting
i frequently call male friends and colleagues darling andor love i also often call them pet flower treacle princess and chick they do the same in return
it depends on the tone of voice and the intention behind the term used my parents or aunties calling me love because they do actually love me doesnt bother me in the slightest a patronising will you make the coffee love from a male collegue most certainly does
male shop assistants tend to call me mate and occasionally and very slightly unsettlingly since i am a rather conventional  year old male dude female shop assistants tend to call me hun or love i dont have a problem with either given the context i do think i would have found it odd if a male primary school teacher had called my daughters darling or love or indeed had called my son mate
i hate being called mate just hate it im not a fan of love either but really who cares its my problem not the person saying its
i dont disagree with your general argument in fact i think it is the real one that should be had rather than the one which is had a middleclasseducated elite concerned solely about language taking offence on behalf of others and policing the behaviour of less educated and poorer people who have fewer life chances when in fact tonight some women in the uk will be physically abused by partnersexpartners tonight an army of working class women will be caring for sick and disabled relatives our mainstream media outlets will be as you rightly say objectifying women in a way that they do not do to men but what do we get do we get middle class people enjoining sometimes uncomfortably with their working class and disabled counterparts do the chatteratti ever notice the position of working class men too their continued place in a system that crushes them as well or do we get an article repeated from about  months ago complaining about language language is organic it follows culture the reason some of the more offensive racial epithets are not so common now is not because someone middle class decided that they should be banned it was because culture changed we start with that not language
admitedly within military slang you can add to that shipmate skipper chief boss lofty sonnymejimbo fella mucker and a host of other less common phrases most often said with affection and respect these will doubtless go the same way as love etc as people get offended when no offence is intended
youre always safe with that one
and then theres duck in nottingham used to male and female alike often as ayup meduck
like everyone taking offence at ken clarke calling may a bloody difficult woman apparently you can pretend woman is an epithet if you try hard enough
little did you know that queen was probably meant as an insult
i for one thought it was a good article and i agree with everything in it a girl is a female child and in a lot of instances women are referred to as girls by men mostly as a way of denying them and refusing to acknowledge the fact that they are adults its an age old patriarchal power play tied up in established linguistics
hey girl can you do this for me do you work in a department store in the s
calm your pretty little head it cant be that bad
well blow me down it reminds me of the exchange in one of reginald hills dalziel and pascoe books dalziel is sitting in his office raises a cheek and lets rip a thunderous fartin the outer office ds wield says sorry sir i didnt catch thatdalziel repliesif youd caught that wieldie it wouldve broken your bloody wrist
dont ever go north of watford or you will be mightily offended
i dislike terms such as love darling etc regardless of whether they are said by or aimed at a man or woman i really dislike being called love or darling by a stranger the idea of them being a term of endearment or affection is negated by the fact that they are generally said to all and sundry without any consideration of affection or anything else when such terms are thrown around willynilly at anyone they speak to they become just cheap meaningless nothings what terms do they use for people for whom they actually do have affection
not the point that was being made it was the teachers unthinking use of very different pet names and endearments for the genders that was being criticised
youre over thinking it and becoming offended by everything its not healthy and very sad
but then sometimes youll say woman as a man and the person youre talking to cant help but hear an inflection thats not there as if youd said bloody woman its all about social context as people here are trying to say you wont get a national or international consensus on this if you did some way down the line someone would want the goalposts moved again until everyone is sir like the later female starbuck in your battlestar galactica very dreary
one feminist writer here at the guarn got upset by some northern men calling their woman my tart deeply offensivebut a couple of northerners posted btl that my tart is nothing to do with being a prostitute but a short form of my sweetheart
absolutely pleasantness even in old ladies has no place in modern life and should not be tolerated
yes how dare you apologise to yourself immediately
was buying something in a shop in bristol recently and after paying at the till and saying thank you the female shop assistant referred to me as my lover the cheek i have never met this woman before and deny ever having had any relationsthankfully my wife wasnt there to witness this innuendo
id say stick to comrade 
colleagues copresenters sure but i imagine having been working together for a while they are friends too
not sure if you realise but youre coming across quite patronising
though i have to say its not quite as bad as young wan which is used down south i know it comes from the irish for woman but it was always horrifying on lovehate when some dublin crim talked about roidin a young wan
at work i have been frequently referred to as girl by customers as in hey girl can you do this for me i wouldnt mind except that my male colleagues arent referred to as boy or even man but as sir by those same customers on the other hand a good proportion of my other customers will refer to me as love or darling or hun but they refer to my male colleagues as mate or fella and i dont mind that because in terms of the level of respect its pretty equal and they use it only in the same way as he and she are used to refer to male and female this kind of thing is always massively about context if girls is being used to belittle at work its very different to when you talk about having a night out with the girls
instead misread
so sugar tits is definitely not on then
why on earth would you object to being treated politely the term is very much a part of us culture you should not travel in or live in countries whose culture you find offensive
if i bump into rebecca i will call her granma
it was meant be ironic
ok instead you as saying love was one of the terms you object to at work
i call most women mate
some boys like their role as boys some girls like their role as girlssome little boys like to play with tanks some little girls like to play with dolls and when i say some i do of course mean the vast majority enough of this niche silliness
its ignorantly discourteous to wear a jolly smile and address an elderly lady as girl madam is more appropriate to her dignity and experience a person in a wheelchair or an elderly person should not be addressed in a patronising manner or with patronising words
one male primary school teacher called the girls love and darling and the boys fella and mate it doesnt seem the crime of the century and with male primary school teachers already being a minority endangered species with all the potential problems that causes for boys in primary school its probably worth cutting the guy a bit of slack
whoooosh
he didnt seem to mind either seem being the important word here would you walk up to a stranger and call him a marsupial pillock and if you did would he be likely to be offended by it
i know it does and i didnt say it didnt i cant see how your comment relates to my comment
stop being offended by everything it must make for a miserable life
i am not the queen the only person who is addressed as maam in blighty
reckon her nappall be knacking getting her heid roond this an all
what a wanker you are
i know and wee girl isnt always that bad but it can sound really infantilising youd never refer to a man as a wee boy unless you were being totally derogatory or predatory he brought this wee girl back to his flat
the sisterhood tends to remind me
how tiring life must be for poor rebecca and others like her fretting over the inconsequential if older men refer to girls it is not because they are being patronising it is because they have done so all their lives young men become old men and many of us retain the morals and manners of an earlier time while also adding the modern ones if we judge them worthwhile i have always referred to boys girls or chaps regardless of age or sex rebecca is unhappy with girls and ladies i presume that women would also be offensive i know women young and old who would be offended if a stranger called them dear or darling whats left that is ungendered and inoffensive oi perhaps and why is it that men dont care what we are called it is not because we are privileged by our gender it is surprising that so many people these days want their individuality respected on every level these very same people do not protest when society herds others into groups that they then disparage muslims fundamentalists gays arabs all of north korea all of iran those spring immediately to mind but i am sure more can be added
the romanian lass at my local coop recently asked me if it was ok to call me loveshe is trying to perfect her english and is doing a course in informal and colloquial englishim  yo and a regular customer i said that love was finethen she asked me if it was ok for her to call the  yo male manager loveany comment as to her calling the manager love
thought police alert
and how do you define ugly kevin
as a group of male friends we often refer to ourselves with the collective noun of the boys are we being sexist to each other
you should not trivialize his name the church will drop using it as its sacred religious content is being usurped just like christmas or easter just say jeeeezus
boys night out one of the boys boys toys here come the boys the boys are back in townthe diminutive terms boy and girl are used in an informal setting in the english language to describe adults in certain settings and you shouldnt be offended by this if there is no ill intent by the speaker
it explored the idea that pupils were treated differently depending on their gender often unthinkingly unthinkingly because our ability to discern between males and females is something immediate subconscious and innate you can no more stop yourself from determining whether or not someone is male or female than you can stop yourself breathing in and out its that fundamental change the pronouns to whatever the fuck you like teachers arent going to be walking into classrooms giving it wow all i see are humans now i cant tell whos a boy and whos a girl
i am not gonna do anything sweetie but i am going to say that if i were in australia i might be referred to as cobber
i call most women i meet love and most men either fella or mate and im not going to change now
skin is a naval term of endearment alright skin
true i have mature female friends and colleagues who would be quite happy to be referred to as girls but i would definitely be cautious in a work context as some people would find it patronising my generalisation was a bit too sweeping
paul hollywood never said girls he said geurlzs
i hope you shouted her down pointed out the horror of that greeting and then retreated to your safe space in the alcohol aisle
babe
 naturally as a feminist i hate nice things and fun  hmm
when i worked for british railways as was part of my job was liaison with traffic control personnel in other parts of the uk quite a few people nearly all of them men and me a man as well in regional control york would address me as flower took a bit of getting used to but then one takes things in ones stride there was also an aussie working at york known affectionately as wogga bill or marsupial pillock and he didnt seem to mind either
it sounds like the cia has got you pushing too many pencils
i like it when shop staff bus drivers and the rest call me sonny fwiw im  yo
i divvin na hinny
about being  or being called son
maybe im old fashioned but i really cant be bothered to get wound up by such trivial things life is too short to be annoyed a stanger has called you son or girl
the girl doth protest too much methinks
and did he continue to refer to you that way
i like it when strangers use friendly familiar terms when addressing me it makes me feel like the exchange is between humans rather than drones darling love hun lover scout dude all good i draw the line a sugartits though that one is not cool
agreed i also would not call a stranger babe but if the local term of endearment in a particular part of the country is babeluvtreacle then the person using it is probably being friendly
on calling a woman a girlin june a year and a bit ago i returned from the local coop supermarket and started a comment to my partneri said ive just been speaking to the girl in the coop andat this point my openly sjw partner said woman not girlnow what i had said to the girlwoman the other side of the coop counter and she is romanian is can i apologise for the referendum resultbuti was cut short by my lady before i had explained thisso what do people make of this
i do hear young men use the phrase wee girl for young women which i think is pretty creepy the word wee is put in front of everything in ni its used by every single northern irish person have a wee bun would you like a wee bag
ladies when is a term of endearment not welcomeanswer when you are ugly
im glad you didnt feel disempowered as a woman because he dared open the door for you according to their post they were a male when the incident happened might have changed in the meantime of course
exactly there are a few guys who use these terms as part of a generally dismissive attitude but most of the time the complaints are sheer doublestandard
berry perkins and giedroyc are all fairly savvy media operators and none of them are shy about making their views known if something offends them they dont need a paidbytheword offencemonger to stand up for them theyre big girls
young girl on the tills at m and s always calls me darling and sweetheartshes about  and im in my sit doesnt suit her and it doesnt sound naturali wish she wouldntbut im not offendedmore bemused
sweet cheeks is my preferred term of endearment
it was the funniest thing that happened to me all week that i can believe everyone must be too terrified of offending you
but love does get said to women
guys is pretty much unisex now
so do we now throw out the x and y chromosome as fact 
its pat
i cant really imagine how it would feel to be male or consider myself gender neutral that does not mean that other people who do feel gender neutral do not deserve respect and acknowledgement and to be addressed accurately i think the question is have you ever felt a surge of irrational irritation at being called the wrong pronoun i certainly have in emails though its partly annoyance because the writer obviously thinks anyone important enough to write to must be male and hasnt googleimaged my female english first name or just left off the mr obviously its a bit important to me that even remote people have clocked that im female in basic professional interaction even though rationally it should be utterly insignificant to me so why should nongenderbinary people not feel the same way
im not a fan of the missmrsms options id prefer miss for all girls and mrs for all women this is what happens in france germany the netherlands and several other european countries obviously translated into the appropriate language just cut out the choice and people will stop making silly judgements
no you may not be trans you may just not identify as male or female
excellent
i must admit that i cannot conceive anyone being gender neutral a limitation in my thinking i confess it seems that genetically man is wired one way or another trans gender actually makes a lot more sense to me than gender queerneutral
 i couldnt agree more well said in my very humble opnion political correctness has gone way too far and has a great deal to answer for
but all of those record your gender as female
perhaps in the past it was so inconceivable that if you didnt identify with a gender or felt you had the wrong body you simply kept your trap shut and tried to blend in
most people are happy being put into gender groups usually based on their genitalia some arent it costs very little to be considerate of the ones who arent and i dont feel you get much insight into a person who wishes to be considered neutralgendered by finding out what genitalia they have
i was talking about my personal experience thanksobviously as i am a male i was addressed as herr engineerchrist talking about milking it
and to think some people still seem to get pissed off when i demand they refer to me as master
im more than happy that a title now exists for genderneutral people it costs nothing and if it makes lives easier it can only be a good thing however the following list of demands we need colleges and universities to embrace genderneutral housing for all students we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity is quite simply outrageous
too simple
the right to call yourself something doesnt mean a lot unless its accompanied by a right to make others call you itgood luck to this guygirlcreature for having mx included in an increasingly irrelevant signifier of our language but unless most people understand what hisherxxs gender identity actually represents then the only way to put the term to use is to be annoyed when people dont use itjacob gets to write a piece in a national newspaper about it but cant explain to us what this gender identity is to himherxx other than heshexe doesnt know which toilet to use or which box to tick on a form the bigger issue that people like me face is that our identities are so rarely taken seriously with respect and even some degree of sympathy is this any surprise
and a very good thing too i welcome it but im willing to bet at airports motorway service stations etc the numbers of kids in the ladies far exceed those in the gents
you gather wrong
or just refer to everyone as your majesty
oed takes ridiculous steps with language its like the compilers of the oed have no understanding of linguistic change they hear a word find a source they can point to and then include it with no thinking of whether the word is actually going to continue to be used or whether it was a fad which is already being abandoned by the time the dictionary is outworse they continually overrepresent words that the bbc alone has decided are new working class slang while ignoring words which have clearly established themselves especially those originating from ethnic minorities oed are like an eager fresh faced academie francaise fucking muppets
the usual response is that its not their responsibility to educate you you should educate yourself even if everyone you ask gives the same response i guess in this case you can at least look it up in the dictionary
in russia they have open neo nazi marches without confrontation gay people routinely harrassed and attacked so fuck what they think fed up with people on here holding russia up as some sort of example of a decent society
all of you in the sea now
get in the sea
ok i get it but lets just do away with titles altogether and avoid all the complications
slightly different topic but why is ms still an alternative to mrs or mrs and miss it was intended as a marital status neutral prefix like mr and now mx also performs the same function i think what went wrong is that when ms emerged in the s it was still a mark of status for women to be seen as married married women were even routinely called mrs john smith also if you called yourself ms people assumed you were a leftwing feminist and probably single so it never became a replacement prefix but surely the time is now long overdue and social statuses much more complex than either married to a man or single for ms to become the sole option for women on documents
minority rights should indeed be taken into account and balanced against the rights and wishes of the majority and the size of the minority is relevant i like the overwhelming majority want to know what gender people are i talk to men and women on average slightly differently in order to speak appropriately and courteously to each because men and women are on average different in relevant and important ways
because then everyone would think everyone else was a french bloke
im reminded of mark radcliffes introduction for placebo the band with the ethereally androgynous lead singer is he male is she female ill give you a clue his names brian
iain no one is forcing you at gunpoint to accept it but the rest of the world is slowly becoming more understanding you can either choose to be on the side that shows compassion and respect or you can choose to be on the side that doesnt or you can choose something in between nobody cares just so long as you dont harass people who feel differently into humoring your personal opinion im sure its not a problem
as a lefty ive always quite liked being referred to as comrade amongst my milieu we often use the prefix bastard when referring to tories
wouldnt being stuck with a biblicalblokey name like jacob be a bigger gendered label
its important to know what gender someone is it tells you a lot of important information im not entirely sure what the information is because it tells me nothing i cannot automatically assume someone has a certain personality and preferences you dont have to know someones gender in order to talk to them  a tiny proportion of people choose to identify as neither male nor female well i guess we should entirely ignore them it doesnt matter how small a group is shouldnt their rights always be taken into consideration this is just a way of arguing that a majority is more important which is false mx is ridiculous and so is the term genderqueer for that matter why all citizens are equal under law and deserve the same rights it seems you only have selfserving reasoning
in russia this problem was solved many decades ago in ussr used a term which can be translated as a friend and this preface doesnt depend on sex nowadays this expression isnt popular
i just wonder how many small steps we need to take until enough people realize we need to use education to eliminate hate sexism and prejudice all we teach is a binary based on the most common biological results gender is reduced to sex and heteronormativity is promoted above all as mentions of minorities are absent or unimportant parents teach girls to be different from boys vice versa and we encourage kids to split things up by normative sex
i guess geeniu got a phd thinking up this one just another obscure term which when people get wrong  times a day the grievance collector can launch into righteous rage about
why not just use m for everybody
man and woman are gender descriptions and some people arent either or what youd expect sex and gender are different also would you call someone alex when their name was george just to be a dick which is what you are saying titles are part of our names and we own our names
i would like to know too do they have either male or female genitalia or both or is it psychological
oh wow the lack of an mx option caused him anxiety come on now our generation feel they have the right to not feel anxious or offended at any given moment
unless you identify with a gender opposite to that implied by your sex then those invented restrictions become a whole lot more weighty for some magical reason
post modern clap trap
ah yes my suggestion fails
the practice of medical professionals choosing the biological sex of babies born with both male and female sexual organs has to stop too there is no reason why such operations must be done at birth before a child knows what gender it identifies as or at all
sex is basic biology and intersex is more common than you think gender is the invented behavioursrestrictions we have built around biological sex
i agree however an awful lot of women are still attached to being a miss or a mrs i worked in call centres for many years and can only imagine the uproar if there was no mrs option there are still women who enjoy being called mrs followed by their husbands name and while it makes me cringe a bit as if they have no identity save that of being their husbands wife they are as much entitled to identify that way as i am to identify with ms or the writer to identify with mx i suspect the best way to deal with this though is to just ring up the documents people and ask for your title to be changed you can at least refer them to the oed now if they get stuffy
wouldnt it be a lot easier to just abolish titles great suggestion ive never understood why on most web forms title is a compulsory field why will someone not sell me a computer cable unless i tell them whether im a ms mr or a rev
excuse my ignorance but what is genderqueer
its important to know what gender someone is it tells you a lot of important information gender is at the heart of human nature and the fact that a tiny proportion of people choose to identify as neither male nor female all best wishes to them may they not be discriminated against etc doesnt change that mx is ridiculous and so is the term genderqueer for that matter just tellin like it is
wouldnt it be a lot easier to just abolish titles a title is essentially a means of discriminating sir over mr mr over mrs and so on just dont bother with anything maybe some will infer gender and even class from a forename but with more migration its becoming hard to remember which names signify male or female and even some olde englishe names are ambiguous
it doesnt at all if someone says my boss is an arsehole you can say oh are they if you dont know their gender
first sensible comment today
jp gt justice of the peace no way this is peace i quite like the idea of old and young as an official title though and swap over at maturity say  or  for nonmen my inclusive new terminology for those who dont with to be identified as males
note to self never ever scroll down unless you just want to read essentially abusive poisonous and thoroughly degenerate comments
being in the oed doesnt make a stupid abbreviation a word or part of the english language it just means some expletivedeleted word scholars have found more than one use of it somewhere somewhen englishmr gt mister from master ie of a house mrs gt mistress ditto but pronounced in an elided missus way miss is abbreviated modernargotms gt means rebellious daughter or concubine mx gt means confused
what has this got to do with your homksexual friends
unless you have both a dick and a vagina the bathroom issue should not be a problem if you have both then you get to choose
im miffed at having to disclose my sex when buying a piece of furniture off the internet what relevance does it have and what bloody business is it of theirs we should all be m if we dont lay claim to something more exotic
no it is not i often swap bw ms mrs and miss never picked up when putting through payments
doesnt mean in english it cant stand for the title of anyone who doesnt have an alternative through birth education of funding a political party
explain why that is so i do not feel disrespected if someone does not use my title but then again i was not brought up with idiotic ideals
it is difficult to overstate just how important this change is the addition of mx to the dictionary represents the beginning of an unprecedented shift in how western language thought and culture understands gender yeah nah i reckon you managed to overstate it
wouldnt that result in every generation having surnames twice as long as the previous one or am i missing something
ms is not a short form for unmarried it is used so that a person cannot tell if married or not it is to be equivalent of mr which does indicate married status for males
it is objectively more important than the signing of magna carta makes total sense it depends on how narcissistic you are though i guess obviously the writer is plenty
it would also be helpful for parents accompanying children of that inbetween age old enough to go independently and feel uncomfortable in a differentgendered loo but not old enough to go alone this is an excellent point of course i suspect having neutral loos alongside gendered ones would result in women using them only in an emergency check out some of the discussions regarding womens only train carriages to get a feel for how that argument can work for me it should be nongendered loos full stop i just think there are potential problems with those too mainly the queuestime issue i have already mentioned as being a consequence of having no urinals
how about h for human or hb for human being instead with an optional yfi you fucking idiot after one of those
titles do not give respect unless they have been earned such as dr the others simply allowed people to be categorised at the minimum and discriminated against before even being met
it amazes me how people who claim to reject societal definition of their self spend so much time thinking about societal definitions just flip a coin and use your free time to think about something more constructive
why do they need titles on forms at all it just allows discrimination get rid of them completely or at the very least just have mr ms mx then at least women will not be discriminated against based on marriage
its broken people not content to just accept who they are they want to break everyone else too and twist society to fit their agenda
ridiculous comment
there is a difference between tolerance and feeling forced to comply
the movement for gender nonbinary people doesnt stop with mx in order to be respected and affirmed by society gender nonbinary people need so much more than a dictionary definition we need governments around the world to create genderneutral options on identity documents we need colleges and universities to embrace genderneutral housing for all students we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity and more than any one of these structural changes we need to live in cultures that no longer make assumptions about who we are or who we want to be based on our genitalia or our sex assigned at birth so we have to reorder the whole of society and reject basic biology so that a tiny tiny minority can feel affirmed and have the pleasure of ordering everyone else around yup that sounds like st century britain 
i can understand what youve described easily enough thats not being genderqueer though at least as i understand it the only way i can see what youve described as being applicable would be if that anxiety and sadness kicked in again later in the day once youd already got dressed if thats the case and the anxiety and sadness at not being able to act in accordance with typical gender roles is so strong wouldnt it be equally uncomfortable to write mx on a form or something when at that point you do feel comfortable as one of either male or female
emblematic disrespect if you give no title
im not suggesting only having neutral loos just adding them as an option it would also be helpful for parents accompanying children of that inbetween age old enough to go independently and feel uncomfortable in a differentgendered loo but not old enough to go alone
im all in favor of using a simpler and less controversial title jp just plain or jpo just plain old i suppose you could add jpy just plain young is f you dont like the idea of calling yourself old
i feel your pain i keep telling people my correct title is zorgon the conqueror but they will only accept mr
except in rare cases where birth defects make it difficult it is simple enough to identify a persons sex gender on the other hand doesnt appear to have any objective basis in that it appears to be a matter for the individual which gender they identify with bourgeois society offers a great deal of freedom for people to do pretty much whatever they want when it comes to personal issues like this theres plenty of evidence in this organ at least that people who make unconventional choices feel themselves to be oppressed but that isnt really the case the large majority of people that make more conventional choices feel that while other people get to play with definitions of what a man or a woman is they dont have to find any sense in something that has no objective basis
thats mx pronounced sjw presumably
i agree i dont care if people want to live in their makebelieve world where they can ignore physical reality i can tolerate it and respect it but the moment you start forcing the distortion of the beauty of gender onto me i will start to not just resent you but detest you masculinity and femininity are beautiful for their differences their stengths and their complimentary aspects people like this want to destroy that beauty because they themselves are broken inside they want to break the rest of us do what you want but dont force it onto others
wasnt the mx a missile project back in the reagan era insert joke about thrust andor getting it up here
maybe but for many of the variables that employers are keen to monitor these days youd have to ask your workforce coincidentally i had to fill in a diversity questionnaire at work just the other day you have to ask in order to find out marital status sexual orientation ethnic origin whether they have kids whether they consider themselves to have a disability etc so just add it to the list you can then keep everybody happy with a vast number of boxes like the massive list i got to pick my ethnic origin from it would also include the ability to refuse to answer which is some peoples preferred option eliland if i had to make a sweeping generalisation id say thats more relevant to the older generation do you think people will still care in fifty years time i am not sitting on scientific studies here but ive noticed a distinct direction of travel even in my lifetime
oed does not take brave steps etc it merely follows by recording words in sufficiently frequent usage those who do best of luck mx tobia
you are of course free to call yourself whatever you like that is your prerogative i however will continue to call men mr and women mrs or miss i am not going to be brainwashed by the cultural marxists
it is a nonsense claim isnt it
it is difficult to overstate just how important this change is ahem
not really titles are just biological realities doesnt the whole mrsmissms issue demonstrate thats not the case marital status is not a biological reality nor in the case of dr is educational achievement titles give information some of which people might not want to share ms gives women the option not to share their marital status mx gives people the option not to share their gender
why do we even have titles in this day and age does it really make any difference whether someone is a miss or mrs or mr or mx name and surname should be enough
theres no need to add mx to the mix just take away all the titles what do we we need them for oh yes thats right recognition in order to be respected and affirmed by society
they has been singular for  years and thats just documented use it was probably used as a singular even before thatdont let longdead uppity victorian idiots dictate your language use
just use the title m thereproblem solved
i agree with you just ask a parisian
that might have been better of youd written speech
what if youre neither a lady nor a gentleman the gits who claim freedom of speech for hatespeak certainly arent
political correctness is dismissing someone as a bigoted old woman to avoid having to actually listen to them
oh they said they always beef up security when the black frat has a party so what about this is a microaggression the fact that this arrangement has proven to be necessary or the fact that the other girl was incautious enough to say the truth out loud when as idea of a dialog is for b to sit bound and gagged while a vents her spleen to her hearts content free speech has not been expanded a is instead an exemplar of my favorite neologism of the year crybully
white people wandering around in blackface is blatantly ignorant and racist i agree with the author about that much however one has to tred a fine line when it comes to free speech by all means call out people you view as racist but realize that they too have a right to respond as long as they do so peacefully silencing racists wont end racism surely it would be better to engage in an open debate where one might even manage to change a few minds take what happened to germaine greer as an example i dont agree with her views regarding trans people but if i had been a student at one of the universities she was scheduled to speak at i would have welcomed the chance for debate
liberals dont do that which is why so many people are becoming increasingly frustrated with this neo liberal leftism
moderators please remove this crazed rant
elton john
its free speach if they agree with it otherwise mob justice
i think i read this back in  have the guardian run out of funds that theyre recycling old ideas or do they just think their readership is that shallow that they would fall for this con for a second time in a span of  years
the pc police only have power if we cave in to their threats stand fast ladies and gentlemen
what can i say freedom is slavery ignorance is strength due process is an outdated joke summary mob justice is the best kind
advocates of free speech would argue that the speech can be legitimate even if the content isnt
the objections to pc certainly seem to be rooted in the desire to be able to punch down without restriction presumably you are also opposed to school children not being allowed to bully other more vulnerable children after all they are merely exercising their right to free speech
as luck would have it you can still killallwhitemen and have major media outlets defend such hate speech
well she never takes the time to reply to any of us or discuss anything so close mindedness would be a correct interpretation
how is it free speech when you get someone fired if they say something you disagree with ala tim hunt
youre not being politically correct by banning certain letters of the alphabet are you
this article is strawmanning the liberal antipc perspective so it misses the mark and is bot very useful it is simple universities should not ever noplatform ban censor people who engage in intellectual thought provided they dont incite crime hate etc oppossing safe space inspired noplatforming of controversial speakers does not mean one supports racist white people doing blackface on campus
apart from racism i think political correctness is dangerous bollocks saudi arabia now on the human rights commission would just love to have a law against religious criticism it would then be impossible to constructively criticise radical islam as it is that dreadful weasel word constructed by islamofascists and the hard left islamophobic is regularly used to shut down any criticism of islam germain greer thankfully is forceful enough to ensure that she speaks her mind instead of being shut down by these pc worms this stuff came from the us years ago in yorkshire citizens advice centre guide dogs for the blind are now called differently abled dogs this bollocks is funny up to a point but in recent years it graduated to these isms and phobics always developed by the left and always used to shut down free speech
been on the scrumpy
what a lot of bunk political correctness is just the modern term for official orthodoxy same arguments same repressions in new buzzwords the bedrock is always the same the alleged corrosiveness or subverision to somones humanity or wellbeing or safety or sense of selfhood aka good ol amour propre and it is not simply a matter of race or gender any expression which questions any mandatory narrative be it racial incitement or holocaust denial or the black legend becomes the crime of political incorrectness formerly known as heresy if you believe in free speech you believe in the right to offend and accept the risk of being offended claiming that certain opinions are out of bounds and beyond the pale because because well just because we dont like them is not free speech and does not promote it as for black face whats wrong with it minstrel shows were part of the us musical tradition yes black face includes mockery so what the thing about cultural puritanism is not only that it kills life and humour but that it is invariably hypocritically partial what about the dance of the old white men an mexican folk dancecomedy making fun of old white men in clownish versions of the jinete hat somehow that doesnt get branded as corrosive to old white mens humanity
so free speech is all about punching down is it tyrants have fallen due to brave people standing up and saying what they believe to be true if you restrict the right for people to articulate their struggles you crap on freedom
political correctness means lying about what you know to be truethere is no open debate any more because the truth hurtstherefore the truth has to be banned
people who think the earth is their toy chest
the problem is that we have raised a generation of young people which champions identity group politics over all other things including free speech dangerous very dangerous places that used to be laboratories and test beds of ideas and philosophies are now safe spaces of censure and prohibition its interesting too that the people promoting the safe spaces are nothing more than a bunch of totalitarian bullies
never trust people who use phrases like but here is the thing
these days language fails us literally people take offence so fast ensuring witch hunt style punishment for the person who dares to play devils advocate within a public debate those with less popular opinions whom are able to articulate an eloquent argument sit quietly those whom can and do make distinction between fair and foul reality and fantasy decent and indecent should be allowed to speak and we should be allowed to answer regardless of feelings being hurt just like greer said my feelings get hurt on a daily basis i get on with my life
in my opinion the author really misses the mark there are alot of legitimate gripes that the pc brigade have but what alot of other people object to is when these minorities go past that to trying to shut down any alternate view like germaine greer being hounded off the university in the uk because one of her views is that trans women dont have the same lived experience as biologically born women it indicates that the aim isnt discussion but dominance and is clearly going too far the author really needs to look at this part of it because thats what the issue is
im sorry but this ultra political correctness just seems so irrelevant there are more important things to worry about and be offended by ask a parisian
but what was the offense eg in the uk the urban population is very much in the majority and has a set of values about animals and the countryside that are quite different to the minority rural population eg they think people who hunt or cut down trees are almost evil whilst the people doing it feel that they are simply living like humans always have and that it is their birthrightso should we be politically correct and make the rural peoples ideas illegal and condemn them and protest against them because we are offendedor should we allow free speech and free living and accept that minorities can be different but still of valuei would say that political correctness is simply a way for the metropolitan elite to impose their groupthink on the rest of society using their greater access to the media to do so
what about the studentsd who banned people from wearing a sombrero or how about all these trigger warnings and safe rooms with cuddly toys and play dough for poor ickle students who heard a nasty word or found out that bambis mummy got shot
white students parading around campus in blackface is itself a silencing tactic how did they deplatform them did they form a circle to prevent them from accessing a certain area did they create specific spaces where only they and no one else can enter or express their view oh wait liberals do that
safe spaces amp political correctness are just the means of shutting down debate at universities if you are unable to cope with controversial debatesviews being heard and challenged at university because you are too emotionally fragile then perhaps you should not be at university dumbing down and avoiding discussions because someone says they are offended is merely censorship we are all offended on a daily basis by things we hear and see its part of being a grown up and living in a free society
and thereby legitimize your attempts to continue to marginalize and discriminate against them i get it
i believe in free speechbut only speech i agree with is a line i have to say very often these days unfortunately
demanding a safe space while the mob shut up a gu who was clearly verbally threatened
political correctness had its place and was necessary to push things forward i can see that but it is in danger now of being taken over by offence finder generals just looking for things to get outraged about treating minor faux pas as if they were out and out transgressions and creating an uncomfortable walking on eggshells atmosphere that hinders progress by creating awkwardness refusing to acknowledge shades of grey and creating a with us or against us mindset
if you cant see the difference between genuine sexist and racist comments and comments that you deem out of keeping with your mind set and way of thinking that you then try and force others to never say or renounce then there is something seriously wrong with you people with your mind set are as illiberal as the people you hate
beats the shit out of comment is free but facts are sacred
as with most things what matters is to think and act with discrimination the objectives of political correctness are in principle laudable but can be perverted when people construct rigid rules they try to bind everyone to a photo of a scantily clad woman might not be sexist
college more accurately called indoctrination camp has declined in standards over the years because we decided that everyone no matter how dumb was entitled to attend now we have a generation of useless spoiled idiotic students who major in nonsense like gender studies and i have nothing against liberal artshumanities and expect the rest of us to respect them and to think that these fools will be our leaders decades from now
gee you just sold the concept to me
the only good thing about political correctness basically an american narcistic power play is that it will make american universities a laughing stock european universities could capitalise if they dont go the same way
it appears to me that those claiming to be silenced are the ones who are dominating the floor space and effectively shutting up dissent and by the way the young lady screaming obscenities at her professor at yale should really consult a therapist
heaven forbid that their privileged cossetted little brains are exposed to anything distasteful
if we knew what was politically correct we wouldnt need politics which is why your article is ridiculous right from the headline if youre genuinely concerned about free speech take a step back and look at whats actually happening here a bunch of college students on the cusp of finding their voices being publicly berated by highprofile writers in national publications because they dont like what they have to say are you sure you know whos silencing whom i think ill let this speak for itself
not only that but we also have whats known as the euphemism treadmill where labels change and therefore whats acceptable changes too for example many people now use the term people of colour but coloured people is deemed offensive even though theres still the naacp knowing what were allowed to say can be confusing for anyone who doesnt read guardian opinion pieces all the time you cant have free speech where even saying the wrong words or making a gaffe can result in people harassing you and calling for your employer to fire you i dont think ms west understands just how insidious pc thinking actually is particularly when some try so hard to police speech
i want the right to keep on denigrating and making fun of the less advantaged in society they do have that right whether you or i like it or not its called free speech
everharrumphing reasonable white menwhite people who think the earth is their toy chest this sort of casual racism in a newspaper has caused recognition to unfurl around me like a hall of mirrors
it appears that there is an essential but subtle difference that both ms west and free speech advocates seem to miss and it regards intent blackface racistsexist namecalling and other aggressive actions are intended to cause ones opponents pain or discomfort its one of the reasons that this seems onesided because those in power dont generally have terms or symbols that will cause them pain what can you call a white man to hurt his feelings but theres a difference between intending to cause someone pain and genuinely discussing an issue in order to get to the truth we have to allow for conversations between racists and nonracists in the classroom as long as they are conducted civilly we have to allow for similar conversations between religious people and nonreligious between sexpositive people and neopuritans we have to allow these conversations even if they cause people having the conversations pain as long as that pain is not goal of the conversation as long as the goal is truth and we can agree on what civility consists of we cant stifle conversations that are uncomfortable even if the people who are made uncomfortable have been oppressed for thousands of years we need to understand that the price of free speech is quite a bit stupid often racistsexisthomophobic speech but as long as it is conducted without the intent to injure it has to allowed while i disagree with the direction chait has gone in the last few years im with him on this idea and i cant begin to grasp what ms is saying here the fact that she conflates black people being shot with academic discourse may reflect her confusion in exactly the same way that a history of rape victims being treated poorly does not mean that we assume that every rape victim is telling the truth any more than we would with the victim of any other crime we dont assume that just because a person is a member of a privileged class is automatically advocating for further hegemony thats ad hominem reasoning and while we have a lot of people using it these days both left and right west should know better
a bunch of college students on the cusp of finding their voices being publicly berated by highprofile writers in national publications because they dont like what they have to say are you sure you know whos silencing whom then they should find and use those voices insted of trying to shut others up they are truly ridiculous with their safe spaces triggers and special rooms with play dough to soothe the offended they deserve to be berated since when was a university debate a dangerous space anyway
or i wont be dictated to by someone taking offence at what i say get back to your bronies
people of colour trying to explain cultural appropriation to white people who think the earth is their toy chest so when is the cultural appropriation of halloween by american supremacists going to stop leave it to the irish and scots
feelings are not truth
not get yelled at online by your florists niece who has a florist
if you offend you could just say you are sorry and consider yourself better informed for future cases no use in a twitterstorm of course just digging in and defend offensive behaviour seems well rude to the point of hostile
that is the world of hallmark greetings cards not the real one
free speech does involve insulting people when those people are too unintellectual to separate their feelings from their brains
theodore dalrymple the purpose was not to persuade or convince nor to inform but to humiliate and therefore the less it corresponded to reality the better when people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves they lose once and for all their sense of probity to assent to obvious lies is to cooperate with evil and in some small way to become evil oneself ones standing to resist anything is thus eroded and even destroyed a society of emasculated liars is easy to control i think if you examine political correctness it has the same effect and is intended to diversity is strength
i will give you an example of political correctness and where it goes wrongi am a man who does the childcare in my familyoften the guardian has articles written about parenting but which uses language that assumes that only women do childcarei often comment that i am a man and do it and that i get the same issues with work etc i often get moderated i assume as my claiming equality is assumed to be offensive to feminists or somethingso my voice and opinion are often excluded from the discussion this leads to two misleading results firstly the only voices left are women giving the impression that only women care about parenting so reinforcing the stereotype and secondly removing my comment that as a man who does childcare i experience all the same needs for better childcare provision and part time work etc it encourages women reading the article to think that they have these problems just because they are women when i am not a woman and have the same issuesin other words political correctness allows people who write pc opinion pieces to bias the comments below by removing ones that challenge their argument
political correctness is a type of religion pseudoliberals are turning us universities into a special brand of madrassas academics who try to use science to investigate sex or race differences must live in fear of publishing their results
political correctness is the negation of ambiguity existence is ambiguous its messy and uncertain political correctness exists so people can seem clever and certain and speak definitively about messy things within prescribed parameters in essence it is completely the opposite of free speech
what is freedom if not the liberty to offend free speech means that one can talk freely political correctness insists that you cannot the two are diametrically opposed
a consequence of free speech is that some people will feel insulted that is not the same as purposely insulting people the problem with political correctness is that it is used as a weapon which drives ideas underground and causes frustration to many who might be supportive
the american university system is currently the battleground for what looks to be our next great culture war free speech versus political correctness i notice you dont dare to mention the scandalous situation ongoing at claremont college aptly summarized in this report by the local news outlet those of sane mind will be saddened to learn that the following day the mob secured the resignation of dean spellman
you dont sound very silenced to me i am always amused by persons claiming to be silenced all the time loudly and at great length often they just mean that somebody has strongly or sometimes even slightly disagreed with them
the hate and abuse doesnt go away slap a piece of legislation in engineer society through the education system in a certain way doesnt get rid of any problem just pushes it underground where it seethes away until a fuse blows
of course political correctness hinders free speechto suggest otherwise is quite dishonest you only have to look at yale and the opposition to dangerous ideas from various student unions to see that they are not interested in learning or in having discussions that challenge themthey only want what they consider to be safe and that means opposing anything that makes them uncomfortable
is
who are you to decide what is and what is not appropriate to say
free speech is anything and everything racism insults mysogeny included short of personal liableany constraint on any of it limits free speech depending on where you stand thats either good or bad
i know right its like political correctness gone awol
the insult specialist
of course that is free speech not all speech is nice and appropriate
as with many liberal ideas the concept of political correctness started out with the best of intentions but is now used by intolerant so called intellectuals to stifle debate
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it absolute rubbish the no platform brigade are one example
the guardian is clueless utterly clueless
absolute rubbish political correctness stifles the exposure of public opinion it stifles debate it pretends to avert problems while pushing them underground it has its head in the sand its my belief that a good part of the present rage prejudice irrationality could have been avoided with debate and forums to encourage ideas with a view to reform and reconciliation while pc rules that can never happen as you know very well just utter certain words and one is slammed for racism hatespeech or some phobia or another and the debate stops
i dont know what problem have with political correctness you can write and publish books saying that black people are inferior to whites or that women are inferior to men you can deny the holocaust in this country and you can attack an alleged jewishmasonic conspiracy you can blame it all on immigrants whatever it is you can be openly homophobic and the internet assures me that voltaire turns in his grave every time someone is civil to a muslim so whos stopping whom from saying what
sheesh who decides whats an insult
the socalled liberal left tends in the usa to be anything but liberal
to paraphrase those who object to political correctness i want the right to keep on denigrating and making fun of the less advantaged in society
too true they have even banned hedgehog flavoured cucumbers baa baaa you cant even say black or even ball which has made snooker very difficult can i say snooker 
the problem is that people have different ideas of what is insultingand we seem to be getting into a situation where anyone who claims offense is automatically the victim and the person who said or did something is automatically the abuser whether or not they intended to be offensive or even knew they were being to that person
framing student protests as bratty political correctness gone mad makes campuses a hostile environment for everyone except for students who have no need to protest i call you an idiotic brat trying to suppress free speech you denounce me for creating a hostile environment in which you no longer feel safe you insist that for you to feel safe enough to voice your opinion all dissenting voices must first be silenced yes that sounds like political correctness gone maaaad to me
theyre certainly selected id imagine how else would one gain entry to further education perhaps the history of indulged student protest should be considered as either a sort of openended stanford experiment involving precisely how instantly entitlement manifests itself or a crashcourse in the methods and uses of privilege for the bourgeois elect
or in the real world a convenient squeak for the not too bright to bleat out everytime something appears different in their world everything is political cxorrectness usually gone md scant attention to the truth is paid just the same four legs good political correctness gone mad bleat at virually every occasion irrespective of the context
political correctness means in essence not insulting peopleit only hinders free speech if one believes that free speech involves insulting people
love zizeks take on this httpsmyoutubecomwatchvdnbwgaaxwm
what the author is saying in effect is that everybody has full freedom to agree with her or otherwise and that this is free speech
the fact is political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it but for marginalised groups rather than the status quo i dont think much of this article makes sense you seem to suggest that there is only so much free speech that can be tolerated and you would rather it be in the hands of those you claim as currently silenced this is not an expansion a free speech overall even in your own terms it is just a swapping of who is to be censured and speaking as a male who has heard his fair share of misandric comments casually aimed at demeaning and silencing menit would be nice if the possibility that almost any social category can experience hurtful punchlines was at least considered in these pages
excellent first two replies political correctness means lying about what you know to be true why you would do that has never been clear 
war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
i think professor erika christakis sums it up pretty well is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious a little bit inappropriate or provocative or yes offensive christakis wrote american universities were once a safe space not only for maturation but also for a certain regressive or even transgressive experience increasingly it seems they have become places of censure and prohibition are you sure you know whos silencing whom yes its obvious
and the gender of the word has in many cases no relationship to the gender or sex of the thing like le vagin
i agree with you and have suggested this only to be met with cries of outrage i am not an it i have no idea why people are outraged people often refer to other animals as it even absurdly when they do know their sex i have seen a newspaper photograph captioned mother elephant and its monthold calf was the mothers sex in any doubtbut your point makes perfect sense to me and if it becaume the genderneutral pronoun i would have no problem with someones calling me it or making an announcement like if anyone has any question it should see me after the meetingproblem solved as far as im concerned and at least it doesnt require the coining of a new word they never sound right at first take ages to catch on and only do so in rare cases like ms
considering my teenager is genderfluid i can assure you that the number of people who identify that way is higher than youd think and certainly in my teens generation the number of people who identify as such is the highest weve seen as a society so far this argument may well be settled by the generation below us regardless of what we think of the matter
my teenager is not an it they are a zie they or them depending on what context the word is needed it works perfectly well for all of our friends and family
we use they them and zie to refer to our genderfluid teenager it works really well actually if people who know a genderfluid person ask then they will be told how that person prefers to be referred to personally im not a miss or a mrs now im married but a ms since i gave birth as i thought given the amount of pain and effort it took to become a mother i deserved having a formal and adult title
this isnt an issue for binary gendered people many trans people are definitely male or female some like my teenager are not zie they and them are what we use and it works really well
how on earth do you know whether someone is just a man or just a woman do you insist on interrogating them examining them under a microscope or is just okay for us to treat people as people and accept that they are who they say they are nonbinary people are real here in the world and arent doing something on purpose to make your life difficult my teenager is genderfluid that is a fact of their life since they were small but according to your logic you know that they are actually male female whatever you designate them aye right
my teenager has a gender identity zie is actively genderfluid so zie or they or them is what we use by insisting that nonbinary people have an unknown gender you insist that they have no autonomy that they are unpeople well they are people and they have voices and they will tell you so if you bother listening
youre contradicting yourself is gender important or no is it the first thing or no
a third person pronoun would also help us hacks with our word counts and copy neatness writing hishers every time for those of us who on principle refuse to default to his feels untidy and inelegant in formal writing wouldnt one suffice a little archaic but if its gone out of general usage as representative of the thirdperson eg one must becomes all people must couldnt it be brought back and used as a singular pronoun i quite like the german prefix ur used in the like of proto or original for possessive determiners as in ur shoes i like ur haircut
yes how do you pronounce this in everyday conversation 
dont be silly if pronouns must agree in number and gender then why has english the same word you for singular and plural the word they is already in widespread use it is the likeliest to succeed im backing it
yes it is actually if the gender of the animal is unknown it is fairly often used
she is shorter
no it is used for things not people or other animals no one would say it walked into a bar to refer to a dog or cat any more than a person
our society has an unparalleled propensity for interjecting possession where not required ive heard people say that about the republican party too 
youre right likely minnesota those guys think the midwest is only west of the mississippi
gal hasnt been used since the fifties and they is plural not singular i also doubt youre in the midwest if you have never heard hey guys addressed to a mixedgender group just sayin
french genders drinks lemonade and all soft drinks are female all spirits are male not quite le jus de fruits leau de vie
there is an argument for having a pronoun specifically for nonbinary people and another one for genderunspecified that will be sexunspecified words have genders flora and fauna have sexes
this is essentially a false premise grammatical labels like singularplural gender etc are simply madeup labels of convenience just because we decide to call a particular form the plural form does not automatically create a necessity for it to always be used to represent an entity that is physically plural in the real world fine so if i say i can say i have two heads even though i have only one
they is not grammatically inaccurate its a return to old english but we do not speak old english in  they is sloppy how about i have a samesex liverwith their name is leslie
im the transitional generation for ms and i love it it made sense to me to be distinguished as a person first over my marital status i think there were a few key reasons this honourific was so successful it smoothly fit into our lexicon its not a word that you stumble over when using it ms is a short hop from miss or mrs the change was a national initiative it was adopted at the highest aspects of governance and worked its way into our culture from there that meant it was used in legal documentation educational curriculum and eventually into social interpersonal communications it was a progressive change to fit existing social climate so it made sense despite objections from traditionalist detractors it was implemented but not forced in other words the honourifics miss and mrs were still applied through independent choice  time for adjustment it took about three generations for ms to become rooted into our lexiconthat it wasnt received as overtly political time heals all so i would welcome gender neutral pronouns for all the reasons mentioned above but numbers  and  are not yet observed lets get our linguists on it settle what works smoothly into our lexicon and back it up with government recognition education and social integration it will take time
they is not grammatically inaccurate its a return to old english in any case a phrase that is grammatically inaccurate today may not be in future grammar changes they is becoming more popular in common usage i see no good reason not to accept this
but sie lowercase means they sie uppercase s means you different word altogether and not a case of singular and plural
gender is the most obvious and identifiable trait of someone at a distance thus it implicit in our third person pronouns as for i or you these are two pronouns that identify the listener and speaker in a conversation gender is not the central attribute of identity nor required knowledge for communication
anything wrong with she 
empathy the gender neutral pronoun is it if you introduce a person as it then you quite literally dont know the first thing about them the words meaning object gender at least communicate that first thing about them he said she said is easier to say than the first person was talking followed by the second person at least for talking about third party interactions involving only two people of opposite genders
we already have a genderneutral singular pronoun the word is it as in he walked into a bar she walked into a bar it walked into a bar it appears that we value as a linguistic culture value human gender enough that it is considered rude or even offensive to refer to them without mention of their gender it was not amused
its good he is in she so fine but only in abstract or hypothetical statements if the reference is actual people a lot of confusion can be avoided if the pronoun corresponds to the gender of the person referred to some languages like chinese already use an gender indeterminate pronoun though in modern usage a signal is given in the written character to female when appropriate and it is not always a help and how are we to translate from the many languages certainly indoeuropean and semitic and possibley many others that use genderdeterminate pronouns shall we mangle them through the washer of our invented gender neutrals
the use of they singular dates back to the th century
precisely why the trans folk should reclaim it
not neutral an absence of its different nope animals have gender well birds and mammals at least
one often sees heshe in use to resolve the lack of a genderinspecific pronoun
to which i would simply echo elyasms point that it is much more realistic that we adapt the use of it than make up a new word many existing words had completely different connotations in the past
that was bad and you should feel bad what are you some kind of loon
i will just use she at all times because it appeases the feminists and the men dont care
i use ms pretty much all the time but only because the only times i refer to someone as mr mrs is when im emailing or writing about someone i dont know and the effort of finding out their marital status seems like too big of a deal i got the habit working in a media agency when ms was the preferred term  of the time sorry ladies but i suspect that in the nottoodistant future mrs and miss will go the way of the dodo and youll all be ms a victory for feminists marriageskeptists and lazy journalists and emailers alike also why did i stop being a master and become a mr it looks like i magically turned into a mr when i was  stupid honorifics everyone should be mr or ms or if they insist mx
sorry im midwest us born and raised and guy has only recently been used in a gender neutral way for many its still quite masculine and its usage is like fingernails on a blackboard the feminine form would be gal if its a mixed group its simply they do you remember blackboardsif you blend guy with gal to create a gender neutral word you get gay or gul one is an amazing coincidence the other is a tern for the worse
ive personally seen in use online quite a bit xe yes but outside of the social justice warrior circles online and in the real world nobody uses it in the real world and in natural english what a native english speaker would default to in natural speech they and it where necessary do the job just fine
it removes the subject and the object from one another what the hell are you on about
this debate of gender neutral language has been going on germany and other countries for decades as these languages have even more of a gender bias eg term of professions having to add suffix in for female and different suffixes for adjectives according to gender of noun etc which often leads to quite convoluted writing like  lieber freundin dear friend addressing friends of different gender in one letterin sweden they have just come up with a gender neutral pronoun it seems very difficult as each language has evolved over a long period of time to make artificial programmatic changes in order not to offend personal sensibilities
i think language should be personal and there is too much implied space with they it removes the subject and the object from one another
comrade in squeakiness le guins recommendation is surely an egregiouscase of solecism gone mad follow the clues le guin linguinean odourof sicilian no
i liked plants more ive always suspected godcame from yorkshire
german doesnt have the dual if we are going to be precise about number we need the dual
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate if thou objectest to singular they on these grounds i hope that thou art trying to persuade the editors to abandon the newer singular you on the same grounds
remember that pronouns must match both gender and number this is essentially a false premise grammatical labels like singularplural gender etc are simply madeup labels of convenience just because we decide to call a particular form the plural form does not automatically create a necessity for it to always be used to represent an entity that is physically plural in the real world if you find that a plural grammatical form is actually used to refer to a singular entity then it is the label plural that is slightly inaccurate and in reality there are many cases across languages where what we label as a grammatically plural form does not actually correspond to a plural entity in real life the problem of expecting a form that we label as grammatically plural to always represent a plural entity in the real world is simply an arbitrary invention notice how if we say form a and form b instead of singular form and plural form the problem goes away
how about they we already use it this way anyway lets just say its grammatically correct after all you is singular and plural and gender nuetral they fits the bill nicely
ok the history of thou and you in english goes like this old english thouthee for singular yeyou for plural middle english thouthee for familiar singular yeyou for plural plus increasing use of yeyou as a polite singular modern english thouthee gradually fades from use you for singular or plural emergence of youse as a plural form and yall as a plural or polite singular us advocates of singular they are pointing out that if you dont have a problem with singular you you shouldnt have a problem with singular they do yall get it now
only because it was once thought anyone not male or female was not human that is not the case anymore trust me no matter what word is chosen transphobes will use it as an insult
i have occasionally used the third person singular genderless pronounsperson per and pers introduced by marge piercy in woman on theedge of time they work like she her and hers these pronounsare elegant and fit the spirit of english better than the alternativescited in the article
i agree entirely however it evolves according to common usage it does not should not change because a certain group of people want it to if you begin using a genderneutral pronoun and everyone else follows suit in time then fine but to impose change or to frown upon those who dont comply is not fine rather arrogant in fact btw i wonder how you feel about other languages particularly those wherein every noun is allotted a specific gender
so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate so language rules should be descriptive not prescriptive as pinker maintains and as im sure other people will have commented on bending the existing rules on whats grammatically correct to use they irrespective of singularplural agreement is less of a leap than incorporating a new word into the language they soundsfeels natural i say roll with it
pronounced heer i wasnt being serious
oh i agree totally we use gender pronouns like theyre going out of fashion
bow to necessity nunn they now has a special usage no matter what you say it means genderneutral singular as well as plural deal with it thats how languages evolve next
we have one already in use they as a genderneutral singular pronoun add it to the definitions of they problem over no neologism has a chance
yes lets all get together and make shit happen
this kills it it could describe androgynous robots robots are robots it as does this for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate change the grammar grammar didnt come from god and even if it did change it it is easier to change the grammar than to introduce a new usage for the billions of englishspeakers who dont want grammar nerds or grammar nazis to mess around and who besides with amply justification are hostile to grammar nerds and grammar nazis anyway lol
no
an important point missed by thevirginqueen our society has an unparalleled propensity for interjecting possession where not required the gender pronoun issue can often be avoided one does not have to say his hat or her coat when the coat will often do better
i cannot agree more on the need for such a pronoun the writer fails to mention one expedient which is sometimes using he and other times using she arbitrarily this can be amusing and even provocative at times i agree that few things grate more than using the third person plural which can result in horrible sentences such as john came in alone and then they went out alone we would not have this problem if some people had the intellectual capability to separate gender from sexual reference the cat does not mean a male cat and neither does le chat i do not understand mankind to refer exclusively to males and i have never considered he to refer exclusively to males either depending on context but i accept those days are gone along with minimal standards of spelling and grammar in our newspapers
thats because it is themselves obviously just as you it is grammatically plural semantically ambiguous
so how do you deal with you just as they you is grammatically plural you are an idiot not you is an idiot but semantically can be either singular or plural any argument against they needs to explain why you is ok and yes i am aware that in some dialects you is now singular and there is a polite plural form which is yall or some variant not in all possibly not in any british english dialects
there is an argument for having a pronoun specifically for nonbinary people and another one for genderunspecifiedexamples nonbinary person my friend serene identifies as nonbinary xe prefers xexer pronouns and i respect xer wishesgender unspecified person if someone dislikes cats sie clearly has no soul and i pity hir fascinating topic and very important to many im glad to see it covered i dont mean it cathaters please dont lynch me
actually many languages from the mediterranean region gender everything and i mean everything for instance french genders drinks lemonade and all soft drinks are female all spirits are male
oh please language is not precious and to be protected against the modern world but a vibrant part of that world
i believe this became a higherprofile problem with people using nongenderspecific userids and at ciflookin at you natashafatale so i generally use she as needed when replying still that doesnt address everyone in the us midwest guys is genderneutral but isnt generally used for all the possible pronoun usages still i dont particularly like it but hey you is often used exampleshisher hat gt a hat the guys hat the hat the authors hat the posters hat the userids hat unless you know the person in which case one inserts the relevant name or pronoun shes leaving gt the guys leaving are you leaving with himher gt are you leaving with that guy i rather like guy reminds fittingly me of guy fawkes masks and anonymous
its certainly an issue thats been keeping me awake at night jeez how many of the worlds languages other than english have a bizarre need to assign gender designations to every flippin word
yes i did read the piece and i did notice there are a variety of reasons for some to want a gender neutral pronoun but that is a far cry from good reasons for imposing an artificial language change on the entire englishspeaking world get off your high horse the language is older and more robust than either you or your argument
reality is youd have a better chance of success pruning the list instead of adding to it
im just thinking of where that might go wrong in east texas
new words are handed up from the downlow
zig is good for the gender metastable
the problem is that gender is not a binary and that how someone is dressed doesnt tell you what their gender is or their pronoun preferences
it is used by transphobes to dehumanise trans people so nope not a viable suggestion
but you is now used as singular with regionalisms like yall you guys or youse
the word it is used by transphobes to deliberately dehumanise trans people so your suggestion is not very helpful
i like the ze zir construction myself its time for a true neutral
that word is used to refer to inanimate objects not people calling people it is dehumanising we do already have a gender neutral pronoun that is used to refer to a single person the word is they and it has been used as a singular pronoun for hundreds of years however given that it is also plural an alternative not it is required which is the point of this article
em is too close to the shortened form of them so common in speech
but it is hopelessly impersonal
wasnt that in the beast with a billion backs great movie
grammatically inaccurate nonsense the rules of grammar are not handed down from on high they are merely a measure of which sort of language is accepted as correct within certain groups and theres a nearexact precedent for a nominally plural pronoun taking over the function of an outmoded singular form we use you for both singular and plural but it originated as an exclusively plural form with thou as the singular the likelihood that an entirely new term created by fiat would actually catch on is vanishingly small given that many people already use they in casual speech as an indefinite pronoun for person or persons whose gender is unknown thats the obvious answer and the likeliest
there are bigger estimates but thats not really the point because there are lots of other reasons to want a gender neutral pronoun for instance when we dont know the gender of the person being discussed or when were talking about a hypothetical person
woman on the edge of time is a really good book but i dont like per as noted its the hard p sound which slows down speech
dear radek in marcin szczygielskis book omega there was a character called dziecko en kid and they were reffering to themselve in polish byłom zrobiłom i have been i was i have done i did it was very interesting
i dont see the problem if i meet someone transgender i always use the pronoun that is most in keeping with their outward appearance that way if they still consider themselves to be of their birth gender and they correct me they take it as a compliment that i both positively recognise them as trans and care about mirroring back to them what they are portraying outwardly
the show futurama covered this kind of they used shkle shklim and shkler 
cmon guys theres gotta be something
true if you want more nuance go to tasmania
themself too sounds horrible
i find it interesting that the word i has no gender and people are just fine with it the same with you some languages have gendered firstperson pronouns and others like polish have different conjugations for male and female first persons eg byłem i a man was vs byłam i a woman was why should only third person pronouns be gendered
i remember the good old days when you just had to look at yourself naked in the mirror to work out whether you were a mr or a miss you may not have liked the reflection but there was no ambiguity over whether you were male or female now days it seems you can ignore the physical and as long as you think you are a certain gender or no gender at all you can magically embody it it feels like a combination of the secret and an anthony robbins self actualisation course all rolled into one unhappy with your gender no worries choose another all i can say is that there must be a lot of unhappy people out there
most housing at uni is already gender neutral and the few houses that split by sex should be allowed to continue to do so
this is also a cultural specific issue many cultures use both a mothers and fathers name as the surname
i meant the whole tone of this article was typica guardian and to be honest i am not surprised to see it in our universities either where guardian style sensitivities are de rigeur i dont think it will be much wider than that however although personally of somebody prefers i address them by mx thats what ill do
i believe its pronounced navel gazing ˈneɪvəl ɡeɪzɪŋ in the ipa
and mr is the code for mauritania ms is montserrat or to give an example in another language sr is suriname
but that indicates a plural what if i am talking about one person
thats fine for one off services i work for a professional organisation and we want to analyse our membership by gender age job level and many other variables thats legitimate i think as we should be trying to be inclusive and taking action if we find were not an interesting point though
of course its offensive to refer to a person as an object obviously them they and their would be used eg they went to the shops to buy their groceries and the shopkeeper greeted them with a smile
many women gay and straight struggle with doing a poo in a public loo we sit there for ages waiting for a moment when the facility is otherwise empty its especially excruciating at work whereas i gather being loud and smelly is a bit of a competition in the gents
if it became a vicar it could be rex
how fortunate to be able to indulge such affectations i suspect life will not be easy with such sensitivities
ladies amp accompanying children men have children too sometimes theyre even allowed out on their own with them
dear jacob tobia it seems to me that you illustrate how hung up some people are on indicators of this or that aspect of sexuality including relations between among the sexes however many sexes they recognize mr indicates maleness but not whether the male in question is married or not mrs indicates a married female before ms came along there was no shortform indicator for unmarried female with mx theres an indicator that ignores both sex and martial status well and good if thats what people want but given names mannerisms clothing will still indicate gender and gender preferences if not martial status japanese suffixes san to peoples names to indicate politeness addressing someone without suffixing san to their name indicates intimacy if the person is familiar or rudeness if he or she or mx isnt its gender and martialstatus neutral even so japanese arent particularly noted for social equality of the sexes during my year residence in japan i never asked an englishspeaking homosexual friend whether he or she felt uncomfortable using mr mrs or ms when switching to english but no homosexual friends seemed upset by such switching either however having said that japanese arent generally as hung up about sex and sexuality as many europeans and especially americans seem to be all in all i wish you well but i dont see what the fuss is about sincerelyjames wiegert
youre lucky you didnt get that phd insisting that people call you doctor would have been insufferable
but is it mxx or mxy
interestingly this is becoming a nonissue in countries using spanish naming conventions surnames never change for anyone even when married we carry both father and mothers surnames some countries now allow to swap surname order so if your dad is jim jones smith your mom is jane frost sanchez you can be named either laura jones frost or laura frost jones
what pronouns to non gender binary people prefer obviously himher are out but it just sounds offensive
same thing i was thinking its already funny that mx is used for a macromedia suite version for some reason and the cattlestrength taser gun whyyyyyy
has anyone seen that splendid south park episode where cartman managed to get his own toilet by convincing everyone he was transgender its all bullshit you either pee standing up or sitting down
lolwut mx is the iso  code for my country
why not
why not just eradicate all titles from the lexicon surely they serve no worthwhile purpose outside the minds of the insecure
pretentious moi
so mucks or as in the romance languages muchwhatever
this is not particularly helpful when properly responding to a formal dinner rsvp as these events normally have place cards to map seating assignments often separating couples so each can converse with someone new and to keep unhappy couples from bickering and can involve many tables the rsvps are needed to set the map and ensure there is not too much testosterone or enemies of any gender at a given table there are numerous volumes on etiquette available to help one better understand the rituals involved if you are uncertain as to how to respond it is best you telephone the hostess to gently explain your predicament andor ignorance of protocol you may find that experienced hostesses will understand and will do their best to not seat you among the more socially rigid on the guest list
sorry thats already taken meaning mexican
you dont live outside the gender binary you just dont like it
just call yourself jacob jake or if you want to get all formal jacob tobia
i disagree if your an employer i am fairly sure you can glean the job applicant is going to be a dour humourless pain in the arse whos going to be nothing but trouble as an employee
nah youre just boring kiddo
cmon i had a mx  yamaha once nice bike couldnt you go with something elsemf mk ml mo anything but mx
more egotism
im pretty sure we should address people however they want to be addressed especially when it is to do with their gender identity
people do keen on using dictionaries to justify their positions should look up the word tolerance i dont think it means what they think it does
so preciousmakes me illcall yourself what you will just dont get angry when people refuse to play along
its on university application forms in australia
sigh oh for ffs
and by serious scrabble players
i think the idea is to have mixed rather than segregated into malefemaleneutral so that gender wouldnt factor into where the person felt they had to go which would hugely increase the queues as tongariro pointed out one of the reasons why we can afford relatively efficient toilets is the use of urinals which men hop into and out of with some speed so  get rid of urinals on the grounds that they are gendered thereby cutting off your nose to spite your face because it will put a much larger burden on the spaceresource required to create loos in public spaces that cater adequately for the throughflow  have urinals in nongendered loos and then constantly deal with complaints that people are being sexually harrassed or oppressed by other people doing manpissing i like the idea of nongendered loos after all the ones in our homes are generally exactly that but i think there may be some practical difficulties to work out first
not really if youre committing fraud and know the cardholders name you can have a pretty good guess at the gender in most cases not all obviously but most
but but but are you saying btl in the graun is not a space where people can argue as though it is the end of the world over something that doesnt actually even affect them im shocked and also thank you for a sane and kind response to this piece i have no idea why so many people are getting their knickers in a twist over it i would have liked a definitive ruling as to how it should be pronounced though
my question too in my head im pronouncing it mix but am happy to be corrected it would also be fun if in a backformation to reflect mister and mistress we were told the full version was mixter sounds jaunty to me can we campaign the oed to give it a fake etymology like that
ill stick with joe
id say it was more mschwax dont know how to do the schwa symbol on my computer
us lawyers use the term esquire after a fellowlawyers name when they write to another lawyer whether fellow lawyer is male or female i like receiving correspondence from my us legal counterparts addressed to ms ethel chop esq makes me feel like i am landed gentry living on an estate in england somewhere wearing a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches and smoking a pipeand the japanese use the title sensei after a lawyers name
mx allows women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature wouldnt that apply to ms anyway not mx
thats far too sensible
not just the guardian the university where i work has mx as an option on its online application forms has done for about a year now
like ms but ending in x not s
in previous times a boy was known as master jones and an adult male as mister jones it seemed to fall away from usage for males but stuck for females missmrs after i turned  i corrected any mail that came addressed to me as miss chop to ms chop with the sender
the whole point of using a title is to allow others to glean a little basic information about oneself the term mx is utterly pointless since it confers no information whatsoever except perhaps that one has an obsession with gender issues you might as well use the title flubalub or better still simply not use one at all
how do you pronounce mx mix mizz em ex
good luck with that may i know the pronunciation please
why identify as anything just leads to misery and these kinds of articles
im guessing mix or moox probably the latter as it has no other connotations by sound would be interested to know its a shame the article didnt cover that
erm yeah for most people your gender although titles are based on sex is revealed as soon as people see you
not really titles are just biological realities and you have forgotten the sexist double standard some women were objecting to if my partner does not need to announce his marital status why should i there is no such discrimination here
i was about to suggest this i buy clothes i like the end
neithernor eitheror
we need colleges and universities to embrace genderneutral housing for all students we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity and more than any one of these structural changes we need to live in cultures that no longer make assumptions about who we are or who we want to be based on our genitalia or our sex assigned at birth and here you give yourself away not content with official acceptance with who you want to be and trusting society will follow you seem to want to force everyone else into your genderneutral world no we dont need to oblige  of the population to use a restroom with everyone else we need  of the population just to decide which door to use stop moaning and have the grace and common sense to accept that the vast majority of human beings like pretty much every animal species kind of prefer the malefemale thing and theres nothing wrong with that but you could also try acknowledging that decent human beings also can accept and respect those who choose to be something different so lets stick to the forms and leave the pubs hotels restaurants offices and universities alone
me three i am a woman i dont feel like a woman i just am one a bit like i dont feel black i just am black thats it
me too or they go straight to missmrs assuming i am marriedunmarried
a plausible choice maybe just squire in the palce of mr also that would not irritate the lawyers
so guardian and i say that as a woman who uses ms although i do wonder why we bother with titles anyway i do realise some people like them but it seems unnecessary
and how on earth do you say it
you lie
in america they make jeans that make mens bottoms look fantastic
if you dont think about it you dont need to think about it but if you get up in the morning and feel immense anxiety and sadness that you have to push your body into clothing that you feel doesnt suit your gender then your gender is in your face all the time imagine being a little girl and your parents forcing you into a dress when you feel in your mind you are a boy a dress is humiliating in that circumstance and painful for you to put on you feel like an alien all day long then imagine growing up and having society rather than your mother putting that dress on you every day
just means you have one toilet one sink in a room many places already have these types of bathrooms and yet still insist on sticking a men and women sign on them why why not just say hey heres a toilet and sink doesnt matter what you are use which one is free
how will you get on when you go to russia or china for a holiday and you have to choose either male or female in the visa application 
i see an increasing number of businesses that dont use any of them they just write things like dear jane doe im all for it lets simplify life instead of complicating it further the whole mrsmissms thing was bad enough
esquire
just pick a gender and get on with it if you feel unsure about your choice flip a coin
or better yet identify yourself for what you are mr will work for me someone else can be poof if they want another butch or lipstick if they want and whatever else it he individual thinks best identifies them if you think about it this is how native american culture assigned and changed names you had a diminutive prepubescent name then chose your adult names later in life yes many cultures chose your names even as adult but if you went out on you own ynatives changed their name to suit their condition or what inspired them so we could have today liar hillary commie bernie omg omalley and joe the stand up comic im sure guardian viewers can come up with good ideas for the republican field so ill leave that to them
good on you i do that as well im sister on a few mailings now
mix or mux according to wikipedia ive been told mzzz online as well so it seems to be a bit fluid
i dont care about your genitals so there
why cannot human males control their primal urges all this cruising for mates by hook or by crook in loos is distressing
usually pronounced mix or mux
mx allows women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature im not clear on how that works sorry if your dad was called mr smith and you have been miss smith how does calling yourself mx smith break the patrilineal nomenclature the break is changing the surname and it is just as broken with miss or mx jones im in favour of people having mx as an option but i dont understand that claimed advantage
sounds like you need a pair of geordie jeans
this article is so funny really interesting how hard people are trying to change language based on prejudice and trying to norm the world ha ha
i identify as genderqueer and are you happy to be addressed as such by strangers
why is anybody who doesnt conform to these strange selfindulgent ideas branded a conservative
would probably be easier to get the phd than to keep having to explain what genderqueer means
thats because i dont identify as a man or as a woman i identify as genderqueer but is gender an identity or a physicality can it be both is it more than a predetermined pairing of hormones and of sexual organs society traditionally concocts all sorts of things girls are supposed to do and boys are supposed to do or arent supposed to do an awful lot of that we can trace through anthropology as cultural artifice with liberation from those constraints where exactly does gender identity lie societal notions of femininity or masculinity are ever more liberalised and fluid a man can be as much like the traditional cultural expectation of a woman and vice versa so what exactly does a mr or mrs or mx provide something about all this is pretty perplexing one the hand cultural gender confines are increasingly exposed to be cosmetic optional and adaptable on the other there is this push to reallott them in a new guise to recategorise something that we are otherwise culturally decategorising ultimately people should be able to do what they want if a mx makes people happier so be it but those conflicting considerations do leave one wondering how much it all makes sense
why not remove the need to have anything before our names and just use names
yawnnonissue
ivan what you really need is a new keyboard im laughing my off ive read your comment three times and i still have no idea what you are saying in fact it just gets funnier the more i read it i notice the grammar police wont touch it
marathon pixie that was well said
kinda think there would be people in the world who would look at this sort of self obsessed bs that some of these first world wankers whinge about wonder what the world is coming to look why not just grab some bloody letter of the alphabet and youve got  to choose from and run with one of thosehopefully that will satiate your needs and rights in relation to having choices
while the term was used by a small group of people and had a short entry on wikipedia it wasnt officially recognized i see your problem but of course it is sheer absurdity from the start that a part of a language has to be officially recognised next time someone tells you that something isnt a real word because its not in the dictionary you should get them to look up what a dictionary is in a dictionary
first world problem
i dont know most of the time i just feel human
so what is it an abbreviation of or is x the unknown factorjust the title m would do surely
coming from a country that still has segregated proms this all seems so american does anyone seriously blackface any more even at halloweenbut the author has been a bit disingenuous the yale email was not just about blackface its just a case of both sides being dumbasses the one side not realising theres a big difference between free speech and offensive stupidity the other reacting like idiots
american universities are suffering from political correctness to a frightening degree i e from httpwwwtheatlanticcommagazinearchivethecoddlingoftheamericanmind which everyone should read as it should make us all fear for the future of the us two terms have risen quickly from obscurity into common campus parlance microaggressions are small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless for example by some campus guidelines it is a microaggression to ask an asian american or latino american where were you born because this implies that he or she is not a real american trigger warnings are alerts that professors are expected to issue if something in a course might cause a strong emotional response for example some students have called for warnings that chinua achebes things fall apart describes racial violence and that f scott fitzgeralds the great gatsby portrays misogyny and physical abuse so that students who have been previously victimized by racism or domestic violence can choose to avoid these works which they believe might trigger a recurrence of past trauma
i just watch that again yesterdaythe opening scene in the theater make me shudder when i compare it to the kinds of protests we are seeing today when everyone shouts over their opponents so that their views cannot be heard this is very true of many aspects in todays society
oh really for fraks sake i have a hard time dealing with the incapacitating sensory bombardment abled people inflict on me i honestly think its their fault for inflicting the pain and isnt my fault for not being able to deal with incapacitating pain i had a hard time dealing with the other beatings and gassings bullies and police and others have inflicted on me some of my friends have had hard times dealing with the rapes
having just reread  i have to agree this writer would have fit in perfectly in that society
speaking as a dull european the whole article makes the usa sound a place best avoided
these students are not being silenced in any meaningful way just as pc protests do not silence their targets in any meaningful way in both cases theres a failure to understand that criticism does not equal censorship and if you want people to hear or understand your message get better at making it
yeah i meant transphobes
excellent post precisely and eloquently capturing the essential hypocrisy of political correctness facism masked as free speech and utterly unable in reality to deal with counter points or debate always falling back on trite assertions of the domination of existing power paradigms or patriarchies yawn i think you should build your own paradigms on your own dime
duh thats those who agree with me at least part of the day
yes its safe space as shield its not just im so fragile i only want to be surrounded by those who disagree with me at least part of the day butim such a crybaby and a bully at the same time i want my safe space imposed everywhere you go
the problem is very dim people who are incapable of critical analysis do have the power to whip up a social media posse within minutes of misunderstanding something
there are two possible positions on the matter of free speech yes or no political correctness is simply no
so what about this is a microaggression maybe a nanoaggression then nope still not seeing it
you sound like a young germaine greer 
the table has already turned as it does each and everytime pc crops up and starts getting exposed to sunlight the last time there was this wave in the s it was mocked endlessly with peak hilarity being enshrined in politically correct bedtime stories a massive bestseller mocking nonoffensive language the new term for pc advocates is crybullies
no man has been transformed into a woman just because we call those who utter this biological truth homophobes you mean transphobes
what i first thought was ironic was when i scrolled down and saw all the deleted comments but then i thought they just have no fucking idea what they are talking about
should we ignore what happened on the missouri campus when student journalists were physically forced out of the protests because they were denied their right to freedom of speech how was this politically correct the asian student that was forced out by a mob of students and faculty was there to document the event for history and just wanted to report on why they were there in the first place how does treating that student in the way he was treated expand free speech this student wasnt there to slander anyone or to berate themhe was a student who believes in the rights that the people were protesting for what was the purpose of kicking him out i believe that all involved in these protests that occur need to keep in mind that while they are there expressing themselves and invoking their constitutionally protected rights they shouldnt be violating the rights of others it gives them a stronger platform on which to be heard
your great issue is that you completely associate the antipc brigade with being wasps or the old white elite this is factually wrong you have a bias and it infiltrates your entire writing
tim hunt doesnt hate anyone he made a joke and qualified it for what it was a self deprecating joke and was forced to resign you should open your mind a little
if the smarter people on the right were to drive a coach and horses through the worst excesses of the pc crowd in a constructive dialogue the result would be an opportunity for genuine progress how can you have a dialogue with people who wont allow the words needed for that dialogue with people who simply put their fingers in their ears and chant racist sexist homophobe as soon as their views are challenged
political correctness has gone to far now any criticism of islam is open to censorship is it that the papers are now so afraid of muslims attacking them like the news paper in france that had the courage to print a cartoon free speech seem to be a thing of the past now you are called right wing islamophobic or racist if they want to build a masque next to your house and you object your called racist if it was a pub or a supermarket you are just a concerned citizen
political correctness makes it easier to talk about certain topics but damns you for other comments it is power once again
agents of the state no there policeman trying to deal with crime sure there gonna make mistakes but enough with this demonization like there just going round executing black people
thats from the same guardian that just several days ago defended germaine greers right to say unpc things httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreenovbangermainegreeruniversitiesfreespeech i guess she gets a pass and honorary almost pc compliant badge on virtue of being feminists
another is overuse of fear nobody can just disagree be disgusted indifferent or simply think that precious snowflake is spouting idiocy nope everybody just fears your righteousness
interesting point indeed a shame theres so few forums for actual dialogue
there is an article about the motivation of isis on the front page
you want to ive here in the us mate if a couple of guys for example are sharing a friendly joke even in their locked office if it has the possibility of offending another person however pc the two guys may think the subject matters is it can be punished with dismissal and i mean however pc it just takes one person to take offense to the main pointi actually have a friend who was dismissed from the workplace after somebody complained to personnel no witnesses myself and virtually the entire office are on his side pc gone mad the system is open to abuse and some are milking it
framing free speech and political correctness as opposing forces is a false dichotomy i agree political correctness is far worse than that the real targets of political correctness are freedom of thought and the truth political correctness is an attempt to stamp a particular world view onto everyone and to rob the language of the power to express dissent born in the universities it is bringing about the destruction of universities no longer are the humanities faculties at university places were minds are formed and sharpened but rather deadened trained to be uncritical of nonsense and to accept dogma without validation telling themselves lies is a way that society destroys itself and political correctness at its heart is a war on truth nor has this war on truth borne any worthwhile fruit the blind still cannot see the cripples still cannot walk women still get raped racism hasnt disappeared because we exed the word niggardly and no man has been transformed into a woman just because we call those who utter this biological truth homophobes the end result of political correctness is increased divisiveness more angst more powerlessness more marginalisation the more you insist that the key to your future lies in the attitudes and actions of other people the less you strive to take responsibility for your own situation and take charge of your life
this paper is beyond parody this is literally doublethink in action political correctness makes speech less free by making certain things de facto unmentionable and therefore certain thoughts unthinkable speech is either free or its not free speech should be absolute hate speech laws should be abolished let the islamists say what they think for all to hear this is extremely important people need to know what theyre saying and thinking behind their ominous silence and we need to be allowed to criticise them openly and freely
get over yourself
hmm lots of whataboutery waah white men are talking but not a shred of argument to support that political correctness expands free speech
a white woman speaking in the name of people of colour and pretending that their perspective isnt important as long as she is there to represent it i am not an expert but isnt that a bit triggering not to mention nonpc
not entirely many on the right simply ignore the pc crowd entirely carry on a separate monologue that is a shame since if the smarter people on the right were to drive a coach and horses through the worst excesses of the pc crowd in a constructive dialogue the result would be an opportunity for genuine progress just running separate monologues makes progress and the elimination of errors more or less impossible
im proud of the left for finally drawing a line and saying enough is enough the people who support this crap are the kkk of the pc
christ she actually believes this guff me i know that oceania has always been at war with eurasia
lindy is to be congratulated for doing her best to grasp what freedom of speech actually means but unfortunately she is not quite there yet as this article demonstrates all too clearly
appropriate neologism this is the age of the crybully a hideous hybrid of victim and victor weeper and walloperfind a lot of crybullies in journalismhttpblogsnewspectatorcoukmeetthecrybullyahideoushybridofvictimandvictor
the group at the university of missouri did all those things a professor even said i need some muscle here to intimidate a reporter in a public space
an excellent example
errmm no nothing at all i believe
obviously you do not believe in free speech if its not in accordance with your own view
and if yourself touche all round
true enough a simple example is the abuse of the word issue in place of problem the word problem has negative connotations but issue is neutral if you say issue when you mean problem and keep on saying it until it is generally accepted then you have a society in which there are no problems and in time where the very concept of a problem is literally unthinkable
i saw a black man listening to enya whilst wearing a bowler hat last week i felt culturally appropriated where do i complain
seconded
its  again
all is binary
you know if a black person turned up at a fancy dress party in whiteface i wouldnt be offended how many other people here would be
pc makes the dumb dumber and the small proportion of smart much much smarter in finding ways of expressing ideas in less direct ways pc has backfired because it has just made its opposite a whole lot smarter
you ought to read john locke and karl marx you will have a proper grasp of the relationship between your own speech and your own ability to defend yourself after having done so
speech is either free or its not people should be free to hold and espouse repugnant views however there should be a heavy price to pay for doing so the ignorant slobs who wear blackface display the confederate flag or engage in other racist behavior should be named shamed and made toxic to any potential employer these scum will only respond to economic pain businesses and institutions that do not address institutional racism should be boycotted
i thought the idea of a university was to learn to debate and hear other viewpoints oh well guess im just not pc enough
do these advocates of pc have anything to say other than blaming people for their own failure to deal with the shit the world throws at them
it was a microaggression so macro that even i could see it it is hard to take anyone seriously after they spout bilge like that the rest of the piece was peppered with more nonsense particularly ripe was the failure to understand that abusing and screeching at nicholas christakis and making demands that are more suitable for a two year old since a two year old child has a reason to not be able to distinguish between its own wants and the rest of the universe serves only to prove to the world that the students involved are far from fit to graduate far from having the quality of thinking we expect graduates to display universities are meant to take rough stones and turn out fairly well polished diamonds yale appears to be heading towards trying to polish coal and pretending that carbon is carbon by caving in to the unreasonable demands of those childish students in no way can this be spun as some kind of victory for antiracism or as a legitimate development of political correctness
in  the introduction of the hays code to censor us motion pictures just made script writers and directors less direct but a whole lot smarter to get the message across in a more sophisticated way same as pc has made a lot of people a lot smarter in expressing ideas and ideologies watch how you say something and you can still say anything
yeah can someone explain to me what hate speech actually is i may listen to someone nod and agree whereas the person next to me may take offense and call it a hate filled diatribe theres a difference between intent to abuse and simply saying something the other finds offensive black people people of colour coloured people etc what is what what is right what is wrong and can somebody claim im using hate speech a very vocal minority seems to be professional offense takers lighten up a bit
this clickbait bullshit doesnt merit a serious response
bullshit
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it expand vto restrict impede or control
i dont think ms west understands just how insidious pc thinking actually is particularly when some try so hard to police speech i think she does there is nothing new with the idea of policing ideas and speech zhdanov and mccarthy come to mind the logic is always the same the world is divided according to a single overriding principle be it class religion nationality power block or identity politics human beings are labelled accordingly free speech is dangerous because essentially people are stupid we need to defend them from the corrosive power of ideas i am the possessor of ultimate truth hence everybody with a different opinion is not just wrong but evil and we need to stop evil at least ms west has no secret police and torture chambers at her beck and call she and her ilk can attempt to destroy people individually mostly on social media and this is less effective
that mob in the picture do look like a right bunch of arsebuckets spunktrumpets cockwombles etc etc etcetc leave em to their idiocy
if you control what people can say then you control how they can think if you control how they can think you can do anything you want with them
limit vocabulary limit language limit ideas works a treat every time as the larger part of humanity is stupid
no the first two comments and your accolades are nonsense political correctness is a bullshit word designed to remove any valid arguments the minority or the left have in response to the powerful and rich was our pms response in the sacking of scott macintyre political correctness gone mad no because it was the right censoring debate under those circumstances its not political correctness but the norm because its the genuinely powerful those with actual power making decisions on what is acceptable and what is not it was not some piss weak university students shutting down some speech on a campus rallying against climate change denial is not political correctness as claimed by the rich and powerful supporting adam goodes against booing is not pc as claimed by the powerful what is missing is context because a lot of the time it is driven by the media and media types was a misplaced tweet when boarding a plane to africa racist and the resulting death threats an over reaction you bet this was not political correctness gone mad this was the majority ganging up on one person it was not pc is was unacceptable behaviour is black face offensive yes should people be sacked over it no the fact is the majority of australians will make up their own minds anyway whether something is racist sexist or some other ism calling something political correctness is simply bullshit it a word that is too general in its application people need to be more specific the reason people feel that their opinion is being censured by some do gooder elite is because a lot of the time the context is lost on all parties to a discussion and both sides at times fell censored but stop using pc
good point the only article open to comments on friday was by barney ronay in the sports section
correctness expands free speechso long as you speak correctly i imagine
there may be done extremes in the msm preventing free expressionoften under the guise of combating pc but generally a civil expression is allowed regardless of sentiment
pc is just another religion that attempts to control what people think and do nothing more nothing less
i assume from your name that you live in canada perhaps i am mistaken if so you must be aware that canada does place restrictions on free speech with laws against hate speech even in the united states with free speech enshrined in constitution there are numerous restrictions on speech which have been upheld by the courts
i fail to see the political correctness angle in your example everybody has the right to hold an opinion even that the other side is evil or an idiot but if you frame a complaint and ask the other side not to use a particular word turn of phrase or costume that you find particularly offensive it is rude of your opponent not to stop using it but rudeness is about the level i think is right and that is not illegal nor is it a ground for laws many complaints about political correctness seems to me to amount to people being upset because somebody calls them rude which is ironic since it seems like another form of political correctness o brain melt
pc restricts free speech by enforcing the suppression or at best attenuation of the expression of opinion such that concepts can only be expressed in acceptable or appropriate ways it is very closely related to orwells idea of newspeak it is pernicious it stifles it censors and it ought to be ended and btw  was a warning not an instruction manual

not only is it wanting to punch down its a fear of losing that position of privilege that allows you to punch down
 thanks
not really very funny seehopper i know you cant mean that
to put it succinctly its all about the sensible middle where the valid points of both sides are embraced but not the invalid ones it requires a level of critical thinking its not an eitheror situation and lol i think this needs to be an official term now the sensible middle 
yes its the despotic regimes who are on the unhrc their clear aim is to further islamofascism and apologises do defer to islamic terrorism bunch of fraudulent hypocrites any western democracy heeds the un at their peril
is political correctness the reason the guardian wont mention the common motivation for terrorist atrocities is political correctness the reason the guardian wont allow discussion of the basis of terrorist motivation if so truthdenying political correctness is as dangerous an idea as the motives of terrorists btw australian political correctness laws outlaws speech which may offend some people not just insulting language also the laws appear to applied unequally certain sections of the population can say what they like while others are muzzled the guardian is also guilty of applying politically correct censorship unevenly

without compassion or context free speech easily becomes an instrument of oppression in the hands of dominant narration powerful entrenched ways
shouldve known the author is full of it by that beefed up security on account of the black frat party example she starts with when i was in college and that was a long time ago when things were a lot less permissive than today many fraternities had ongoing issues with the police because of their rowdiness and all were white the author picked the one black she could think of to support the bollocks she filled the page with she failed to mention the ethnicity of the cops who in la pretty much represent the racial makeup of the city clearly minority majority
no of course not but not being able to call a female actor an actress even if she acknowledges the nomenclature just silly
society freespeech is the cornerstone of our society minorities fights oppression by exercising free speech society no no no not like that
i completely agree the antiwhite hatred literally oozes from this piece theres also this one  an yearold white girl whose grasp on racial politics could generously be called foetal i am becoming increasingly concerned that rather than being a force for good these social justice warriors are the real haters
my major objection to this article is that it pretends to be for free speech while in fact is a proponent of censorship i dont mind if you want to be a proponent of censorship a belief in banning all kinds of speech is a perfectly legitimate position to hold but have the balls to be honest about it say your against free speech that we should have laws in place to socially engineer opinions out of our society we dont like
mary i believe you have got it covered
we have to allow for similar conversations between religious people and nonreligious between sexpositive people and neopuritans we have to allow these conversations even if they cause people having the conversations pain as long as that pain is not goal of the conversation as long as the goal is truth and we can agree on what civility consists of we cant stifle conversations that are uncomfortable even if the people who are made uncomfortable have been oppressed for thousands of years we need to understand that the price of free speech is quite a bit stupid often racistsexisthomophobic speech but as long as it is conducted without the intent to injure it has to allowed well said silencing debate simply because the subject is painful is counterproductive and actually impedes social progress
really you got upset at that girlsboysladslassesblokesladiesfellaswomenwhateverthis has really gone too far my normally rational mate voted brexit because he thought that the pc thing had gone too far and maybe leaving the eu could reverse the trendi know please get a sense of perspective
my wife goes out with a group of friends and refers to them as the girls and her friends do the same should i let her and her friends know of the monumental error they are making or should i just leave them to get on with it
its my observation and will be as equally valid as your observations social media experiments on youtube are full of examples of erotic captial and human nature at work its a fact most women swoon at attractive men most men swoon at attractive women its just the way most of are made snowy

the thing is shes right crucially of course its all about context wilfred owen calling his fellow soldiers boys carries a completely different subtext to a white sheriff in the american deep south calling an adult black man boy for example
according to natasha devon the woman
i usually say to my friends hello goodbye kidsim  most of them are over  can somebody tell me who im abusingits just become guardidiculouswhy dont we forget all the social niceties and just become  ish
i think i use mr fucking important quite often which is actually sexist as i generally dont actually know the gender of the driver
my wife goes out with a group of friends and refers to them as the girls and her friends do the same should i let her and her friends know of the monumental error they are making or should i just leave them to get on with it
it doesnt make any difference thats my point us men will rarely say or do the right thing because women arent sure themselves what they want us to do or say
no it doesnt im a woman and it makes me feel annoyed and patronised do you need a lie down dear
paul hollywood is a prick
you shouldnt be offended by this thats going too far be offended by whatever you like just dont expect anyone else to give a foetid dingos kindey
i miss words like luv in everyday conversation and think were losing something of our unique culture as a result however i get why it has offensive connotations for many women and doesnt fit in the corporate world but perhaps it is about tone for everyday life
i have read the article carefully and nowhere does she say terms which are used equally for male and female are not ok she makes a point that context is everything
i was once a bit ruffled when i headed down the m a bit and the woman in the shop called me duck but ive since learned its just a strange place called birmingham
i hate being called dear by salesclerks
i think dont call grown women girls is a good start my female friends will often put girls night out on their facebook feed theyre in their late s my  year old mother calls her friends the girls so why cant i call them girls
meh girls boys love the terms themselves are not derogatory it is about meaning and context condemn people calling others love and as many women as men would be found guilty while these conversations are worth having lets not get carried away and find malice or harm where there is none
touchy
good nothing like thinking before you speak
or better still me luvver as used by anyone of any gender and all ages to other people of any gender and all ages
hahaha
therell be milk and cookies at a designated safe space
i admit there have been some male colleagues with whom i exchanged the title mdear but that was semiironic and largely because we had a genuine affection as well as respect for one another its context
enjoy your humourless joyless silent worlds where no one dares speak
oi you pint of bitter please
a fact any evidence what bullocks
obviously driving i stick to twatregardless of gender
why not if it doesnt bother them
exactly
this is where i do an in tears with laughter face and sign out thanks for being contrary on the guardian comments page it makes it more fun
would you mind the same request from a female colleague
whatever love ill be in the shed
girls actually has a positive effect i think as it makes women feel youthful i dont want to feel youthful in the workplace i want to feel respected and authoritative as i should bloody do since im one of the more experienced people here and proud of it incidentally nobody here would dream of it because theyre professionals calling female colleagues girls in this day and age signals clearly that you aint professional
the girls the girls instinctively the word made me wince of course it did the horror the horror do you have any similar reaction to the use of the word boys to refer to colleagues or comrades or can only feminine terms be considered loaded in your universe presumably for example wilfred owen was unacceptably patronising in his lack of respect for his fellow soldiers when he belittled them as boys gas gas quick boys an ecstasy of fumbling fitting the clumsy helmets just in time sadly i know far less about the inner workings of the great british bake off than i would like to but that complete lack of knowledge wont stop me filing this weeks  words of selfrighteous outragebyproxy
oh for gods sakethis sort of discussion was current in second wave feminism in the s and s it is the sort of thing that would be discussed in spare rib and in those days may bewas relevantbut in 
if its any consolation i encourage the girls to be strong stand up for themselves and find their voice and show the boys how to be kind to be open and to talk
cameron was riffing off an advert from the time actually it was tineared not sexist
nice
i remember as a student in manchester in getting a bit annoyed when a bus conductor called me luv but soon realised everyone male or female was greeted this way about the same time the wonderbra ad said hello boys you cant let this sort of stuff bother you i realised life is too short
i used to work in a uk state school as the only man in a department of five i actually had to confront my coworkers about them consistently calling me babe telling them that i had the basis for a sexual harrassment case made the office a more professional place to work after their moment of realisation and silence from my professional experience i see women use these terms more than men but lets let the graun pander to fantasies of evil men
or just natasha devon as shes not a childrens mental health tsar anymore 
this is like the puritan movement for the st century the puritans probably believed they were doing the right thing and serving the greater good
oi prick
just say hello wankers it covers both sexes and many people when im driving i say it all the time
depends how you say it not every word that comes out of mans mouth is meant to demean
when i lived in sheffield everybody called everybody luv took a while to get used to apart from tommy beighton greengrocer commonside who called me pet
al jolson was intending to pay tribute to black music and perform rather than offend but
people women colleagues fellow bar customers
 of my exes both said that women dont know what they thats why its so hard for us men we never know what to say or do
i would never call a woman a girl i do find myself calling female colleagues i like and respect love occasionally i find myself doing it with a male colleague which is a bit startling for both of us personally id value a bit of a steer because it is genuinely a term of professional affection but if women find it patronising i would stop women often call me love in shops and the like as im a northerner
her world problem
is this in liverpool where eh girrrrl is a completely normal form of address i miss that one makes me think of the russian devushka girl used exactly in the way you describe all the time in all sorts of situations and to women of all ages too you feel grateful youre not being called babushka grandmother
oi you 
because im not a girl im an adult woman im also no lady it has connotations of restrictive behaviour that i dont subscribe to
i called the ceo of the company i work for sweet cheeks much to the horror of my manager he answered my question without so much as a smile but called me chick afterwards you judge your moment and can usually gauge a person
if he said ladies youd probably be vent about him labelling them as a group of old coots so what is the safe answer here lads and boys get thrown around just as much so lets stop inventing more craps to get offended by eh
oi you
calm down dear
the former childrens mental health tsar natasha devon should that not be tsarina
the only reasonable solution to all this gender nonsense is for women and men to stop talking to eachother completely no social contact no work contact and no family contact have all men live on one continent and all women on another and never let them meet reproduction only by artificial insemination and the children shunted of to the correct male or female continent at birth problem solved
ill take that as a compliment then seriously most women are less inclined to be offended by men that are attractive its just a fact snowy the question of our age is a smiley face an unwanted term of endearment
firstworld problem
i am a man who works in a school not as a teacher and i use those darling and mate with the children i work with all the time darling i copied from watching my wife interact with kids and mate just comes naturally because im common im afraid
well i prefer to identify as a swan
i think terms of endearment in themselves are fine its all to do with how they are used elderly woman calls me dear nice david cameron saying calm down dear ugly display of sexism love chuck my loverrrr west country duck i think they are sweet and in the main meant kindly we are a bit short of kindness towards our fellow creatures and this form of address can make a lonely person feel a bit better surely better than being treated sourly or thoughtlessly but as i say only if used right id rather random strangers that i encounter taxi drivers people on checkout or in shops generally bus drivers etc addressed me in that friendly way than totally ignored me or assumed i was such a moody cow it wasnt safe to call me anything i spend my life trying not to become such a person or to communicate it to other people it would be very easy to do so and sometimes i do i am sure give out such vibes when very busy or under stress i havent yet graduated to the happy mellow state where i use those terms of endearment myself but if i did it would be because i genuinely felt that kind of universal goodwill so im not sure i agree that it means nothing it means that person addressing you in that way is at least superficially kindly disposed towards you and that means something
i just remembered that youre not allowed to use miss now either
its all about the intention if its not intended to be offensive then if its perceived as such the problem lies entirely with the recipient
to be fair most of us adult women do also there is a difference between referring to your friends as girls an affectionate diminutive and your colleagues as girls
definitely report for reeducation immediately
no
it seems reasonable to refer to the pupils at a girls school as girls but wait dare not mention the social contagion thing
girls or boys can informally refer to adults its a figure of speech women themselves refer to a girls night out and men speak about being one of the lads etc you should stop trying to find offence where none is intended
my husband and his best mate are the boys to his partner and me im certain they call us the girls too close friends and even colleagues can be hun i dont mind pet or ducks from someone who grew up with that vernacular the tone of voice has a lot to do with it someone calling me dear or darlin in a clearly sarky tone will get a glare from me they will then be ignored as clearly they have no clue how to address someone
girls is infantilisingladies makes them sound oldwomen as a mode of address is just weird as fuckguys you cant use because theyll bleat about not being maledarling sexually suggestive microaggression i want to speak to the manager you just cant win stick to hello fellow humans in the same voice as the protectrons from fallout
ello treacle
people who worry about things like that have something to worry about
i think dont call grown women girls is a good start
after an accident a paramedic called me flower and it felt comforting i agree with the writers sentiments on the use of names context is everything i too watched the tv programme no more boys and girls it was most enlightening and has influenced my thinking on how we treat children i recently saw the signs brilliant boys and gorgeous girls on the doors of a pubs toilets and felt that at least one of these was wrong what about great girls
do you walk like a duckdo you quack like a duck
it offends me that you are not already aware of what offends me
what do you call a group of your pupils little shits
i told her as you suggest in fact she has already suggested this to me but wanted my confirmation
i have always smiled to myself when football managers refer to their players earning millions a year as the boy or the boys equally think that this infantilism leads to their waywardness not just in the way they drive their toy trucks but the way they seem to interact with the girls
depends you need golden syrup for a lot of recipes
one of them will probably tell me the difference between phased and fazed
my mother all the way up to her late s referred to various groups of her friends as the girls in exactly the same way i refer to my something mates as the boys so perhaps mostly is your take but not that of everyone
the list would be  men should only speak when spoken to the end
yes i used to hear that in sheffield i think someones mentioned it below 
so paul hollywood saying girls in a non patronising way is offensive where as a guy farting and calling you princess and girl is fine confusing to say the least im a man and i get called darling hun sweetie all sorts its meant with affection and thats how i take it perhaps we could keep our anger directed at sexual predators and not turn the whole issue into a joke
good for you for recognising its your problem
i come from the land of the prom we say yall
by an older man and it usually is an older man so youre ageist you seem very judgmental and my  year old mum refers to her friends as the girls
possible i dont know any german however this is english
wow are people still being so absurdly childish over gendered language time for them to grow up really
indeed that is why this is a specious argument
old english offers a solution to this linguistic dilemma people are reluctant to refer to a person of unknown gender as it as it now for us connotes an object however the antecedent word of it in old english is hit which could be reintroduced into usage as a nongendered pronounso something like heshehitit himherhemit hishershitsits plurals they them theirs are allinclusive already
nor what you think he thinks it means
anythings better than xe
it is an important point seriously how much more of a nonissue could she have picked this is right up there with that huffpost journalist who said that women are oppressed by the word too and the sweatshaming rubbish that was in this paper
no problem with using nongendered pronouns and if it solves the issue of people wanting to switch from he to she then this would be an added bonus i dont see why my bank should know or care what gender i am my doctor on the other hand
sexism is discrimination based on sex words that acknowledge the existence of gender are obviously not that turkish hungarian finnish persian are entirely genderless and as we all know there is no sexism or sexist language in those societies right
lacking a genderneutral singular pronoun other than it forces you to specify a gender even when you dont want to people have either tended to default to he or use a gender stereotypically associated with eg a profession if doctors are often referred to as he and nurses as she this subtly reinforces the idea that those professions are more suited to a particular gender
but when you are talking about a specific person its obviously appropriate to use he or she so genderspecific pronouns are not about to disappear
what are you whinging about my point was the use of the word they but do feel free to take offence your post is as sensible as this article and the whole argument rubbish in other words and maria is a girls name or a womans there you are ive given you another reason to whine
i have used they in this way for many years its easier to repurpose a closely related word than make up a new one it isnt a stretch to reimagine they from meaning a plural collection of people to an unknown subset of genderless people instead
yep mark twain is always good for a laugh and the german language i believe every word you say hes written quite a bit about germany i think he travelled it
your name really suits you
as for myself im using he or she just out of politeness in the english language environment in hungarian it gets even better then the author thinks actually these languages finnish hungarian do have gender neutrality because the language keeps the memory of the matriarchal origin i give you an example and i think not many actually i think none except myself hungarians are aware of this the word for grown up woman is nő its the same word as in grow you can just imagine yourself an aphrodite of milos sitting in the pantheon ages ago quite happily you should note that this is a single basic word like man in english as opposed to woman it even gets better the word in hungarian for grown up men férfi is composed of two parts the word fi witch also the basic root and in the ancient language was used instead of the word fiú meaning boy the word fér means something like there is enough place for it examples without minor linguistic niceties this cabbage fér in the bag there is enough place for the cabbage in the bag it is a verb so put together férfi its a boy we have enough place for you could just see a hut where the women lives with their matrilineal relatives a man becomes grown up when a family takes him in finding enough free space for him in their hut
at least our nouns dont have genders
what could a rich white educated man tell us p
oh for gods sake but is god a he a she an it a they a the latest mélange of a word invented by an angry trineutral feminist
theres nothing new or unusual about using they as a neutral pronoun when is your cousin arriving theyll get here about 
personally i think we should make a fuss over any use of language that excludes us by gender race sexuality or religion i found myself saying recently that like any other good christian i wanted leicester to win the league would have been good to hear lorraines views on that incidentally the name lorraine is quite exclusive itself alsacelorraine would be more inclusive or alsacelorrainelsasslothringen if you wanted to be really really inclusive and welcome germans too
i thought it was a deliberate cruel and completely unecessary goading of blind people
as part of a liberal feminist grammarnerd circle of friends oh please enough when are feminist woodentops going to desist from gazing into their psychic vaginas and seeing all sorts of nonsense he as neutral reference is perfectly acceptable just as mankind refers to humanity i read a great deal of thth century literature in my work where he is the general rule of thumb i have absolutely no problem with it perhaps because im a dastardly he or more likely because ive no severe gender studies constipation
ive been using the singular they for fifty years teachers in the s always used to correct it and id always ignore them
and if you dont know the name how do you specify plural in the nd person
changing the language will do little there are languages with just one word for he she and it like malayindonesian where dia covers all three and even verbs only have one tense but theres plenty of bigotry all the same language is not the problem
ok lets say someone uses that kind of language instead of using genderneutral language do you have any proof that this kind of language is causing sexist attitudes its easy to make the assertion that this is a problem but im not seeing any solid evidence that it is i understand that it might be difficult to prove but that is not a reason to just accept whatever you say as fact when youre trying to convince people of an idea you need more than a hypothesis having a hypothesis is all well and good but you should not expect people to buy what youre selling just because youve convinced yourself that things are as you say they are
where do you think the language english came from directly from god
or not
yeah good job i didnt say there werent but most people are pretty rubbish at identifying what is a mistake and what isnteg the whole myth of split infinitives or people freaking about the use of could of in informal spoken english people not getting the importance of register etc etc
in german ladle is feminine and spanner is masculine its so triggering feminism is masculine too which only goes to show that the patriarchy is alive and well in germany stealing our female words and putting metaphorical knobs on them
really would we even be talking about gender at all were it not for feminism
i thought the authors use of see what i did there was misplaced the american dialect society could safely assumed to be more than one person so using they to refer to them is correct and wholly expected the author didnt do anything remarkable did they now you see what i did there
right all the conventional usages of the past came about through a miraculous coincidence though practically everyone used he and his for pronouns when these refered to any unspecified individual it all just came about by a wonderful accident and that is why some thirty to forty years ago in the midst of much other social and political upheaval some feminists began to make a great point of the use of the impersonal he and his as part of the the bulwark of a sexist maledominated language which itself served the perpetuation of the larger sexist social order i see it all clear now
pointless whataboutery that only serves to derail discussion
as deke is an unusual name it would be helpful if you could clearly state your gender when commenting
i think youd want to make it mandatory to know if people were cis or not as clearly you would need to know about the state of the genitals of those you are talking to in order to use your preferred pronoun designation rather than the generic they cis is never used unless relevant ie dating talking about gender issues sex advice columns that sort of thing wheres the problem
then you will know that these types of discussion go on in those languages too
this is not at all true in my personal experience of liberal arts higher education efl teaching copy editing and translation it has been in current usage throughout without being even slightly controversial or political rather it is preferred as it is less clumsy than he or she anyone who can structure a reasonable sentence can use it in the singular in a way that is entirely clear i think perhaps the writer of this article shares your view that it is rare and political in its usage she is however mistaken
lets also start changing the our laws to make them less gender specific
on the other hand it is clearly an important enough issue for you to read about and comment on
i am perplexed using they when you dont know the gender of a single person seems entirely reasonable although i would prefer one but using it when you know perfectly well that the person is female or male is preposterous and thinking that using she is somehow sexist is double preposterous
being called a policewoman doesnt bother me at all because i know it covers both women and men andrew policewoman age 
paidfor offence taking at its very finest or its very worst
me too ever tried reading a wiki page on a gender fluid person
but it has a masculine derivative word origin c thei from old norse their masculine nominative plural equivalent to old english thā
yes in fact women have it so easy in this country compared to the examples you give that presumably we shouldnt be worrying about sexism in the uk at all until that is we have rectified the problem elsewhere i guess the same goes for racism and other forms of discrimination if we look hard enough well always find places where its worse so why worry about it here
i am quite happy to use they as a gender neutral pronoun if someone wishes that does not mean i want to see the end of gendered pronouns they do still have some utility all of those neopronouns like xem zir or whatever can go take a hike though pronouns are not supposed to be personal otherwise why bother using them at all just call everyone by name all the time
so if a young woman never sees the word she or they could she naturally know that he represented her too no in this sense women were inherently excluded so if a young man never sees the word he or they could he naturally know that she represented him too no in this sense men were inherently excluded oh look that argument holds no water a barbed comment i never questioned because at the time i already sensed some things were easier if you were a boy what bugs me most about that comment is that you have based your entire philosophy in life around a perception which was a never true and b only ever an assumption because you were never a boy and never had any idea what it was like to be a boy that pretty much sums up all that feminism today is based on though a assumption by its proponents that all boys but especially white ones have it all easy an assumption which is nothing like reality but which is apparently enough to change an entire culture to one where boys are now having it so easy that they are outperforming girls so well in being crap at everything and achieving the lowest results possible that theyre all fucked as far as having any kind of future goes not that any one of those who brought about this state of affairs could care less
they has long been used in the singular in english but not to denote genderlessness im a bit confused by this by genderlessness does the writer mean the gender is unspecified it seems like thats the intention but they has been used that way for a long time so is the jane austen example supposed to be illustrating what the writer is talking about or an example of how things used to be different
as someone who writes a lot of letters amp emails everyday ive always found the necessity of specifying gender really annoying and bizarre in the very frequent case of addressing or referencing a generic person say company representative having to first ascertain their gender or use ugly heshe sirmadam notation everywhere purely to satisfy grammatical requirements is a case of language hindering rather than helping communication i usually use the term ms for the same reason to avoid having to find out irrelevant details purely to satisfy obfuscated language rules
any authoritative recognition that they is used as a gender nonspecific singular pronoun is welcome in that it would help to allow for the usage to become accepted by dictionaries style guides and the like i agree but youll be pleased to know that almost all decent dictionaries american or british have been using they in this way in definitions for decades im rather surprised theres still any controversy around this use at all
because the default in our language is he and because of past patterns of use that have been demeaning why not improve
youd be a guardian pick if it were up to me you dont know how many times i have tried to explain that english does not derive from german but never managed it as succinctly as you
it must be very refreshing to never have to address any of the easily solved problems around you because you are so very concerned with further away much more intractable issues that will take decades to fix what a relief that must be
there is no half of the population not included when the word citizen is used
or to e terry pratchetts called the vieux riveryesknow what that meansnothe old masculine river said nannyyeswords have sex in foreign parts said nanny hopefully
i read the whole article and i still do not see how using he and she is supposed to be sexist there is nothing inherently sexist about having the gender of the person mentioned within the language ok heres an example youre writing a set of rules for doctors employees customers etc and you write something like an employee arriving at work should present his id at reception some of your employees are female some are male so why his id  of the time you can get around it though by writing something like employees arriving at work should present their id at reception
its funny how i really dont care about these problems
more  newspeak corrections to english thank goodness i also speak german french and italian
lorraine i bet you wonder why trump is doing so well in america
the subject of the ed sentence is maria which youve chosen to omit with the complete sentence there is no confusion over number admittedly with maria being nonbinary the use of they here is odd but then it is exceptional
they the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in english that awful american exptession get a life springs to mind as if the world doesnt have enough real problems waiting to be sorted out
third person stackednote to self hire an editor
what ever happened to one one might not hear that so often anymore one could question this singular retreat from the linguistic landscape if one is so inclined or one might think it a little too posh another solution is to have male writers use he whilst female writers use she then it is up to the reader to avoid getting tangled up into questions like why have they put the male pronoun when the hypothetical person referred to could just as easily be female with practice reading singular pronouns from male and female writers the reader will eventually come to the realisation that all written or spoken language is not directly literal and that there are certain metalingusitic considerations that limit forms of expression such realisations are helpful because they encourage careful thought about our own expressive devices
you formerly ye made the transition from referring to nd person plural or polite singular replacing thou no reason why they cant be appropriated for the rd person singular just do it might bugger up nickys grammar test though tha knows what i mean 
good pick up there plain rice youre on fire tonight
thereby including the other half of the population how awful
its funny how english speaking people always mix up grammatical gender with natural gender
i use that too but its unwieldy sometimes and heshe and she i quite like they though
youre missing the main point of having a genderless pronoun which is to avoid using the masculine he when the gender is unknown which puts the masculine in the position of default or supposedly neutral in cases where it is useful to specify gender then this can easily be done
i read the whole article and i still do not see how using he and she is supposed to be sexist there is nothing inherently sexist about having the gender of the person mentioned within the language and by the way i dont see how this has an effect on things anyway because there is no he or she in the finnish language for example as you pointed out yet that doesnt have any noticeable effects on gender attitudes this is just fluff
im rather disappointed the op has not delved into the german pronoun man which is gender neutral despite being similar to mann man language and people can be complicated
anyone right or left using the word solpisistic is probably obsessed with language i had to look it up still not sure exactly what it does mean
many people used to think the world was flat it doesnt make their experience a warrant of truth as i implied we are viewing language and conversation as something which takes place on an immaterial plane can you point me to any examples of where excluding the use of certain words has conclusively made the world a better place other than where performative use cannot take place
its a pity this years grand national has already been run
only old farts and pedants get upset about it i used to find that they as a singular grated a bit but ive got used to it we old farts and pedants are not as conceited in our opinions as you young whippersnappers
where do you think the language english came from we could not be bothered with derdiedasdemden etc and just choice the 
this might just be my chinese im learning japanese not chinese but the characters are mostly the same but thinking about which character thatd be i could only come up with this 好 which i was taught was woman and child with the association of the affection of a woman for her child the character gets used when saying i likeam fond of seems it could maybe have originated as girl and boy as children in the family though or indeed the heteronormative love version as your colleague sayshttpsenwiktionaryorgwiki好glyph_origininteresting so at least there are various possibilities for the origin
why
you can be singular or plural so there is no reason why they shouldnt be both singular or plural
thinking the questions would be political and mainly about ttipidentity politics are favoured over the politics of social justice in the slacktavist herd because it easier to be righton than think for yourself
that makes perfect sense
is that the wiki page the author used for this article
i think wittgenstein just disproved your second point then didnt he
the genderneutral hen based on hän meaning he or she in finnish for the record finnish colloquially uses it se when talking about anyone including animals i dont see why it scuse the pun couldnt be introduced in english if needed aaand i must mention that for such a genderless and supposedly nonsexist language finnish uses the exact same verb for to marry and to fuck also the word from woman shares the same etymology aaand i recently realised the most affectionate loving word for mum emo or ema just just might be derived for the finnish word for le vagin ematin so whether the finns are truly nonsexist in their musings remains debatable
thats strecthing things it would be more concerned with references to our wifes and so on
of course using they also means using are for singular but as youve pointed out we should be used to that by now
i am a qualified tefl teacher and teach to foreign students when i teach them about the use of ms as opposed to missmrs they are often astounded we have such a term hee hee in germany i always ask why the german word of a girl is neutral mädchen so logic out the window perhaps it would be more appropriate and keep the greens happy as a sikh we refer to god as her which caused a lot of problems in th century india thou o lord art my father and thou my mother thou art the giver of peace to my soul and very life guru arjan bhairo pg 
it is problematic because you need a specific for plurals if you dont want to specify he or she you can simply use their name he and she are shortcuts
i am female i have never thought that references to mankind and man as in what a piece of work is a man excluded me i also dont mind being a she in fact im proud of my sex and would never want anyone to dilute my gender by assuming or implying anything otherwise switching from he to she alternately in the same piece of writing would be so confusing as to be laughable
i too find that odd surely a possessive describes the owner and not the thing owned but not in french google translate cant handle it at all
im a married feminist and a ms but im not a ms only because im a feminist but also using mrs makes you sound ancient and matronly of me and three good friends who married only one uses mrs and took her husbands name probably should also note theyre the only couple with children
there is no such thing as pure hard and fast rule in english i doubt that many people think there is there are however useful conventions that are worth knowing even as they evolve
and inevitably they will land on the floor outside
people like her that go after nonissues like this because real problems would be too difficult
gah part of the problem and not getting it womennow
are they hes or shes 
if you want a laugh read twains essay the awful german language very funny as it reminded me a lot of my tussles with greek grammar
gordon browns horror at being caught calling mrs duffy that bigoted woman was the horror of one who realised that the political correctness that states any questioning of mass immigration is bigotry or racist has been seen through and is deeply unpopular outside the ranks of the politically correct it is now a vote loser your other points are well made
language communicates thought farage was mentioned in the article because he uses respectful language to conceal his real thoughts which have since slipped out people rarely use nonpc language to conceal thought instead it shows their real attitudes if their attitudes towards others showed respect for gender or race the whole concept of political correctness would be redundant that some think it is okay to use such terms means that there are still problems frankly i would rather have people use these terms in the open where their attitudes can and should be challenged openly enforcing pc language does not explain a thing it just drives bigotry underground only for it to burst out later
i think its exactly as you say to a certain extent my issue is that using the language of political correctness someone like nick griffin can appear to be reasoned and reasonable which we know if a front
i think most of us whove come up against the pc brigade in real life know how theyre just the carping disgruntled minority prone to take umbrage at whatever they see as offensive speech of the sexist homophobic racist xenophobic category at their worst these people are just laughable and get loud guffaws from people like myselfi only hope that brandis overturns section c completely depriving these people of their security blanket from which they chuck potty bombs at those who upset their tender sensibilities
lola the greatest poverty left on earth is ignorance and many celebs think fame means theyre beyond reproach til they get the lesson that awakens their remorse for that awareness of where they lack afterall celebs are still human beings i think hes sincere about his remorse but it doesnt lessen the impact and saying it in a stupid porn paper article means most of us women will never read it thank god and thats his bigger ignorance that he thinks its cool to do interviews in a porn magazine your last paragraph drew my attention mostly using greater equality greater means its not equal equal is one ient equal and any thing lesser or greater means there is still distance to go ending racism and sexism and agism is far from over and too many people get away with it
really im distorting his words i placed ation marks around those particular words because i was ing his words in the interview and the last time i checked his whole line is that it is hypocritical to suggest we dont all use that type of language implying that it is normal to thats simply not the case
some es from orwell but if thought corrupts language language can also corrupt thought political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear says it all really
he said what he felt realised the pc brigade would be out to lynch him so backed off hes not the first to do that and unfortunately he wont be the last its a bit like the spanish inquisition repent or else
the op is constructing a strawman being against pc brigade does not make you against equality and equal rights thats a hardcore logical fallacy
if youve got a point to make rather than just a set of ridiculous and offtopic straw men to set up based solely on your own preconceptions and bigotry then make it otherwise dont waste my or your time
or even really danek
rally danek you are the expert on this are you
how about if i word my initial point in a non sarcastic joke way would anyone listen to me if i said this article abused and offended me if you said no that makes no sense to pc brigade as long as i felt offended andor abused then its discussion that shouldnt be said by pc brigade logic
shhh dont mention jimmy savile
racist jokes are not funny especially when they hurt
i did not know that rio ferdinand was an mp
and by the way oldman has fully apologised for acting like a prat and admitted he was completely wrong so we can probably stop going on about it now httpvarietycomtvnewsgaryoldmanonkimmelimanaholeishouldknowbetter i said some things that were poorly considered oldman told kimmel once i had seen it in print i could see that it was offensive insensitive pernicious and ill informed words have meaning they carry weight long after youve said them and i dont condone or excuse the words i used in any context i just basically shouldnt have used them in any context i have deeply injured and wounded great many people while kimmel thanked oldman for not canceling his appearance in the wake of the furor oldman thanked the latenight host for giving him a platform of apologize this gives me the opportunity to say to those people who were offended from the my heart i am profoundly profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic
the furore over george browns comment about the bigoted woman was a good example of pc brigade that woman was a bigot and he shouldnt have apologised pc made him feel he had to say sorry when he should have stood by his unguarded comments pc brigade have been a useful way to slur political parties members bad jokes and gaffes like guardians misconstruing of ukips room full of sluts and kenneth clarke having to apologise for saying in a clumsy way that some rape is more serious than others which is is clear as the sky is blue i shall repeat pc was designed to stop abuse but is now used to shout down discussion and debate no reasonable person can say pc doesnt need rolling back
neil the bathrooms free unlike the country under the thatcherite junta rick the peoples poet
we once thought was
on the plus side as soon as someone says things like political correctness gone mad you know you are probably dealing with a bigot of some stripe the phrase acts well as a warning along with terms like im not a racist but feminazis i dont see why we cant use the n word if rappers can white people experience racism too but men alsoinsert are raped beaten etc repeated ad nauseam on any and all articles about violence against women blackface isnt racist cos my black friend nigel thinks its funny and so on and so forth these sorts of phrases act as a red flag they allow the bigots to rally together and the rest of us to be forewarned some people actually genuinely believe they are being victimised if they are called out on their racism misogyny or general bigotry the truth is of course they are in no way victims or being censored they can say what they like and face the consequences of that when other people say what they like right back language is very powerful over the decades we have altered much of the vocabulary we once thought were acceptable this will continue to happen the reason the bigoted fight so hard to be allowed to continue using prejudiced and intolerant phrases is that they understand just how powerful that is a few desperately backwards folk will always relentlessly refuse to learn and adjust society will continue to improve and let the alf garnetts of the world rant away unheeded in the background oh and having a comment deleted on a forum isnt censorship simply start your own hate blog you cant rant to your hearts content nope i wont be replying to hateful comments i rarely bother to even read the replies froth away 
oh how things have changed since jimmy saviles days
and by the way language does not have the power to construct reality it doesnt even have the power to construct peoples mental models of reality all by itself its just a part of that process
yes you explain how common courtesy suppresses free debate but you dont explain how the bulk of political correctness is only what you see and you conveniently ignore everything else about it to make your point
political correctness as humourless language policing is an idea so normalised presumably by normalised you mean accepted as valid by a majority of people i mean god forbid that ordinary people should be allowed to form their own opinions about what a word means and how the world worksactually in that sentence youve neatly encapsulated what most sensible people find disturbing about pc whereas existing traditional forms of politeness evolved merely to facilitate pleasant and nonaggressive interactions between different individuals without causing any of those individuals to neurotically question their every thought and emotion at the heart of the pc concept is the idea that most ordinary people are a savage boiling welter of viciousness and prejudice and that altruistic and enlightened architects of acceptable speech have a sacred progressive mission to cleanse these ordinary people of all that potential hate by using strictly enforced language codes that never for one second allow the ordinaries relief from the notion that they are basically disgusting violent savages and without their betters there to relieve them of their naive notions that its safe to think for themselves the whole world would instantly plunge into brutal chaos
he is an utter prat but the issue is not as one sided as the columnist claims is she able to confirm that her friends of similar ethnicity never make derogatory comments about these unfortunate enough to have been born white i cannot comment for her but have heard several offensive un politically correct remarks from that location it is as though only the majority white population have to demonstrate correctness whereas a black mp can use expressions such as chock ice without censure and extreme muslims appear to have a god given right to defame jews christians and gays i am old enough to have been taught that we have the right of free speech if that freedom is to be curtailed then i want to see it to be uniformly enforced
yep youve obviously been so suppressed that the party you support came first in the european elections but then theres nothing ironic about complaining about the pc nanny state whilst voting for a party that wants to use the state to drastically wind back rights of individual freedom of movement womens rights and equality for gays to make it fit their version of what is correct
oldmans comments are valid hes not saying people should insult or be derogatory hes saying that people take jokes and opinions too personally having said that some of the people who complain most about pc are in fact the most censorious people around the daily mail springs to mind
i know in the spirit of jeremy clarkson i made a really offensive nonpc joke about michael schumachers brain injury on several top gear forums and it got pulled down by the administrators every time and to think if i had made it about a mexican or a disabled person that wasnt an idol to people who watch top gear it would be considered hilarious
sounds very familiar to the campaign cameron and his cronies ran anyway back on topic i dont for one minute think gary oldman has let his guard slip to reveal his true nature personally i think hes apologised far too many times now lets move on its a non story
you make an assumption that political correctness is inherently correct in itself it isntwe have now reached a stage were certain groups may only be referred to in the most glowing of terms and even falling slightly short of that entitles the pc brigade to condemn the author as some form of ist or obethis is now beginning to be counterproductive and as a result in the area of race relations all the good work that has been done to date is starting to unravel
folk such as liddle have become the new antiestablishment daring to push against the ceiling its telling though that the whining entitlement whores that bleat about pc gone mad etc have only droningly predictable thirdrate contrarians like rod liddle and richard littlejohn ive just noticed whilst typing this that they share initials are they actually the same person playing an elaborate joke to supposedly represent them and lets face it if rl and rl are the bright new faces of antiestablishment were all screwed 
coren is a nasty piece of work at the best of times i was also glad to see marie le pen win so many seats in france case closed
after all the bile and hatred levelled at baroness thatcher on these pages when she died no one at the guardian has any right to pontificate about bigoted language
ive met a few people over the years who deserve the description can have a fight in an empty room i think hes one of them funny but theyre usually middle aged white men as indeed am i with an overwhelming sense of thwarted entitlement as you say leave them to fight with themselves theyll eventually argue themselves into boredom or exhaustion
and i wish to buy both hawskwoman and mumsnot a cyber beverage of their choosing
you seem to delight in missing the point
imho the antipc crusade has always embodied a sort of reverse political correctness in itself
you obviously missed this part of the article the right has consistently trounced political correctness but many adept rightwing politicians regularly use it to their advantage nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable heres a lesson from australia where the electorate fell for a rightwing loon who ran a slick pr campaign pretending to that he wasnt actually a rightwing loon doing and saying all the right things to appear nonthreatening guess what he got into office immediately broke a substantial number of promises and returned to being a rightwing loon it turns out the crazies on the blogs were reflecting the true views of the party all along whoops
what them too waiting for neither to arrive to put out the fire
who in the pc brigade is only indignant about racism as you suggesthave you never read the reactions to such comments in this forum
coren is a nasty piece of work at the best of times i was also glad to see marie le pen win so many seats in france hollande was as much a socialist as blair was
speaking as a fucking christian i am honestly not particularly bothered or offended by that or any other pejorative termthe expression does not reflect any depth of thought worth getting upset abouti would certainly agree that taking offense at such fluff might well divert from what could become a mutually enlightening conversation
the term political correctness is enough to make me chuck from my experience the very people that complain that they have been vilified are saying the same things about someone else i have never met anyone who has not crossed the absurd boundaries of political correctness its illogical humourless and panders to the whims of minorities who are no better than anyone else
yes such as the radio devon dj sacked for playing a racist song now that as the old cliche goes really is political correctness gone mad its pathetic its ridiculous its dangerous and were all sick of it
they knew the difference between words and actions we seem to have lost their insight in our time so true my grandmother was telling me about when the american sambos her word where in pubs in the uk during the war and the american whities again her word didnt like it and would cause trouble segregation and all that she said that most of the time the american whities got thrown out or arrested as the locals didnt have such a racist attitude and thought the black troops were generally very polite nice boys and were happy to drink with them to sum up your point i will e verbatim a phrase that she said to me the sambos were willing to die to fight hitler so why would we not like them
facts are not a conspiracy theory it is the active attempts to suppress and obfuscate those facts which is a conspiracy and gives rise to the belief among others that there is a conspiracy afoot which has something to hide
it isnt the words themselves that are offensive it is the intent that in using them unfortunately that isnt easy to discern so some just look at the words themselves
never mind hollywood thats a sideshow what about the pervasively criminal banking industry 
political correctness has been hijacked by organised criminals to cover up their activities
i guess you would label me as antipc but your assumption as to my motivations could use a second thoughtthere is another facet to this continuum that is the unpredictably evolving nature of what is acceptable and what is notsometimes the goalposts move overnight i had a colleague a few years back that failed an interview for a specialized posting despite being uber suitable in every waywhen he eventually pressed for feedback it transpired that he had used the term nitty gritty during his interview that oblique reference to the slave trade permanently blighted his career despite the expression being common parlance literally the week before a large number of us canvassed management for a definitive forum of words or expressions to avoid this was not nor ever has been forthcoming that made a number of us pretty hostile to political correctness but not because it infringed any sense of entitlement it simply represented an arbitrary yardstick that we never knew existed until we unwittingly breached it
 and you take issue with what part i said exactly
the met police
which kind of proves his statement was correct
jeanbaptiste whatever his name is if you want anything done you have to do it yourself
the tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum partly i think because many use political correctness as a way of shutting down debate with people whose views they dislike a case in point is nigel farage and ukip who have been too readily and too easily dismissed by the bienpensant across the political spectrum as closet racists a number of writers not least on the guardian have pointed out that this refusal to engage with ukip on any serious level has contributed to his success i myself dont agree with farage but media coverage of ukip seems to have focussed mainly on finding daftnonpc statements on ukip blogs cheap easy journalism and politics an interesting example of this was found on the edition of have i got news for you aired on the day after the european elections farage had appeared on the show a few weeks before and had been ritually mocked not least by victoria coren who appeared on both shows there was a distinct sense that the panellists were really quite taken aback that this frightful little man should have had the nerve to do so well when rightthinking people had taken the piss out of him
do tell point us toward the specific statute
lola why do you subscribe to publications that objectify and exploit women
the age of the internet means the age of words words and pictures have an exaggerated importance now they get over analyzed strangely enough its often backwards it can be genuinely funny when the person with the biggest heart calls you names in person whereas axe murderers are at great pains to seem inoffensive
not all criticism counts as abuse true however i think being called a racist a bigot stupid a wanker evil etc does all those are very very common here left wing commentators spread them about like confetti then cry when they get something similar back like i say hypocrisy
this piece was practically incoherent what are you trying to say
freedom of expression is not freedom from criticism thats pretty basic
allegedly dismissedallegedly anti gay remarksoffendedsa groupa high profile muslim are you incapable of using actual examples you know names dates etc something that can be verified and discussed and stop trying to turn ofendedns into a thing youre not a trendsetter
i grew up in the same circumstances as you in manchester but i can clearly remember phrases like the pi shop ie the shop run by south asians being used as if they were completely polite and normal terms i have to admit that some political correctness irritates me but im glad weve moved on from that mindset
okay lets look at some real examples from the past week recently an opera singer from georgia was allegedly dismissed over some allegedly anti gay remarks by the sydney opera due to some offended agitating do you imagine that the singer is now disabused of any prejudices they may have had or confirmed in them do you imagine that life for gay people in georgia would be made harder or easier by the offeneds carrying on a high profile muslim was invited to give an ideas festival talk on honour killing and its relation to islam in sydney of course the offended all got together and had a public banshee party until the festival withdrew the talk do you imagine that the muslim community now feels justly treated and more understood in australia do you imagine that the publically vilified muslim speaker is now going to be more conciliatory and more persuaded by the offendeds carry on a group of offended got together in bendigo and had an angasm fest because a mosque was to be built in the town a town which has had a peaceful coexistence with muslims for decades do you imagine that the local muslims are now more or less likely to feel that the radical islamists might have a point do you imagine that australia has been made better of worse by those offendeds persecuting people
see your spiel makes you sound ridiculous when you rant like that you become as annoying if not more than the people you condemn
its about being put in fear of your lifegays are not the only people that have felt that emotion
he apologized because the lefties holding the purse strings would have abandoned him otherwise purely a careersaving movepc makes people better more convincing liars
yes and then people can call you out on your views if they feel that those views are worthy of criticism not all criticism amounts to abuse you know the price of freedom is eternal vigilance
hell we really do live in the age of labels
if youd care to actually read my post you find i address both the specific which the article starts with and the general which it finishes with
ooooooooohh
no he didnt if you want to press the point feel free to e the relevant passages in full and unedited if you please
political correctness is an attempt by the left to hide or distort the truth it happens every day
its you fucking journalists and media types that have got us in this state where we cant abuse anyone without having to apologise afterwards
jees now i really have seen it all an article complaining about those that complain about political correctness i never thought it possible it provides an intersting insight into the mind of a lib dem though
the words are just a weapon and shouldnt be seen as the hidden beliefs of the person saying them i love the twisted logic here im not a gunlover or a killer even though i shot him through the head three times the anger made me do im just an angry man it was the anger that killed him not the gun not the bullets and not me put my anger in jail execute my anger but let me be free to shoot and kill again
yes you are absolutely correct i let my soft heart get the best of me for a moment there
but you just said gay marriage doesnt affect you so i hardly see why it would interest you in the first place either youre only interested in things that affect you or youre not so if something does affect you do you then have a right to express a view on it
political correctness has essentially become mccarthyism
no one is complaining about hate speech they are complaining about the pc brigade protesting demanding people lose their jobs or threatening people for either a slip of the tongue out of anger a joke or taking even the mention of a word completely out of context right now a not even a black person cannot on tv read a book that says the word nword to highlight racism in old literature in the context of talking about old race issures if they did so without censoring the word like i just did which would diminish the impact of their point they are guaranteed to lose their job as the tv station would be threatened with protests and legal action context is what the antipc brigade is fighting for
but if they were to change in way in which you dont agree with would you grow up and deal with it sure i was opposed to gay marriage until i realized that it didnt affect my life in the slightest i grew up i dealt with it its not hard try it sometime
all of us do not see the image you do when we hear the phrase pc and many of do not merely get annoyed by people who say bigoted things rather we think of higher proportions of young black men criminalised in societies where they are minorities of disproportionate stop and searches in the uk we think of hundreds of years of degradation and violence bankrolled by europe that still affects our mentality today we think of young gay people at school bullied to death we think of friends raped or not being paid the same as others glass ceilings eating disorders selfhatred we are not merely annoyed
he apologized because the lefties holding the purse strings would have abandoned him otherwise purely a careersaving move
great riposte
look i feel for you but i genuinely think things are improving at one point these idiots were the majority shouting down any opposition to progress and racial equality now they just seem like the majority because they rank amongst the loudest and most bellicose people on the internet but they dont represent everyone as they say it gets better
banning humour is the only way forward
indeed things do change but if they were to change in way in which you dont agree with would you grow up and deal with iti suspect not
the guardian received wisdom is that if a man says it shudder shudder then its an act of bigotry
the astonishing ability to take larger social and economic issues personally this is not about you rather it is about a more general construct of the white straight rich male capitalist and what he has been doing on a macro level for a long time i repeat this is not about you

it strikes me that after years of exploring human diversity sullivan might need to recall that heterosexual twoparent monoracial families are all part of the rich mix thats literally his point i dont think hes the one being overly defensive here
people apply this vocabulary with a blunt literalism asking adopted children about their real parents in keeping with the presumption that nature consistently trumps nurture but nature is in some part important my father was adopted his nickname was little f as he was very short his unadopted brother was called lofty as he was  i am very small myself and at the very least it has restricted the choice of sports i could excel at basically no sport except for potholing in my youth as i could get through gaps in rocks that bigger people couldnt
a housewife commenting on the guardian have you finished all your cleaning and cooking duties for the day already or are you perhaps employing sarcasm in a username
so whenever youve said something must or should happen you have some kind of repressive or compulsive means in mind
thats one bill in one country its not replicated elsewhere samesex marriage hasnt led to the imprisonment of those who wont refer to someone as husband insisting its inherent in the argument is just a lazy way of objecting to something without challenging the substance itself one neednt engage with the argument for it is merely censorship or authoritarian and therefore can be then dismissed without further thought
how can anyone suppose that i am more of a real father than my husband is i like andrew solomons work very much his notes on an exorcism is one of the most brilliant pieces ive ever read on depression and in far from the tree he does the world a service i think in parsing otherness and i understand why he wrote this article it comes from a deep place of having to explain oneself in relation to others over and over but hes more than a bit defensive here and there as in the above question and i feel overeggs in going on about biological relatedness when adoptees have been telling their stories for decades to enlighten the rest of us profoundly ive known lesbian couples with children since the s and many gay male couples and have never felt it was anything but normal im surprised that solomon is putting forward such a generalised view of people in heterosexual relationships with biological children as lacking in empathy or comprehension to the point where they need to be told superciliously that theres nothing wrong with their lives such statements demean the lives of billions globally whove given birth and are in loving heterosexual relationships are we now going to call that a tyranny or genetic imperative it strikes me that after years of exploring human diversity sullivan might need to recall that heterosexual twoparent monoracial families are all part of the rich mix
no whatabouting please were discussing our society
but eventually yes
thats why i used the word ultimately review bill c in canada this is where this will ultimately head
ok im ancient yobut when i started reading this article i immediately assumed it was being written by a woman as he referred to his husband
they dont need nor likely want your pity
birmingham for one
the article merely reflects the selfcentredness of the kinds of people who concoct the kinds of transient biological arrangements described in the article as opposed to the selfcenteredness of those who object to the article because its too difficult to remember too many words im not sure what you mean by transient biological arrangement though the biological aspect isnt transient and theres no reason to think that the social relationships would be
pity the children irresponsible parents of so many hues
it is the modern liberal way everything must either be banned or compulsory not my idea of what a liberal is but as my granny always used to say every day is a schoolday is it acceptable to use the word granny if i have offended someone or something i apologise
whether our son georges surrogate mother is like an aunt you could have fun with this no shes more like a gandalf to his bilbo
you want everyone else to change their vocabulary to make things easier for you good luck with that
bit of a mouthful besides she isnt an inlaw is she
the article merely reflects the selfcentredness of the kinds of people who concoct the kinds of transient biological arrangements described in the article
huge nonissue i have an adopted brother a foster brother and a foster sister i always refer to them simply as my brother or sister and they always refer to our mum and dad as mum and dad easy really
ill give that a try might work
but that in nature here we are in the cultural realm what i see outside in the real word is that the words dad mom grandpa etc are still being used and are not being changed by polically correct words
language aside with same sex marriage and same sex adoption being a new idea the issue as to how children might feel about the issues has hardly been touched upon and it is the childrens life not the parents
its not difficult to see where the article is coming from a wider range of words tailored to the various situations he describes would make life easier for those involved but i dont think that the different arrangements he describes are sufficiently ubiquitous for words to have developed as a shorthand for describing them given the huge potential array of different arrangements compared to their relative rarity that may take some time and these points dont even take into account the social inertia there are plenty who would quite deliberately resist having words to describe what they disapprove of
though obviously homosexuality isnt a choice if society needs a frame to revolve around then family seems a good place to start and perhaps conservatives should welcome families made up of people of all sexualities or none
 dog or bitch if you dont mind what is it with these sexist chauvinistic posters on cif
sarcasm theres never really been a period in time when nonbroken nuclear families were that common extended families used to be the norm there has always been a fair amount of adultery and absconding kids born illegitimate etc
where exactly
so why the extras in the description why not just the mom and dad
marriage between cousins is common in india but nowadays strict rules apply so for example a man cant marry the daughter of his mothers brother because they have genes in common but a woman can marry the son of her mothers brother because they dont have any genes in common similarly a woman cant marry the son of her mothers sister but she can marry the son of her fathers brother and conversely a man cant marry the daughter of his mothers sister but he can marry the daughter of his fathers brother i understand there are two different words for cousin one describing the relationship between those cousins who can marry and one describing the relationship between those who cant or shouldnt marry it makes life a lot easier
i am who i am the rest is silence
excuse me what makes you think im old
try convincing people who follow certain religions that theres nothing wrong with other types of families rather than encouraging us to hector ourselves ffs
the plan such is it is is to allow everyone the freedom to live as they wish as long as they are not harming othersif you find this either threatening or some kind of evil conspiracy then you might want to wonder quite why it upsets you quite so much
invent as many new words as you like just dont expect many people to use them exactly the infinite variety of potential relationships the author alludes to means that the new vocabulary would be huge noone would bother to learn a load of new words just to be introduced without offence to some distant relatives at a wedding and would instantly forget instantly forget them afterwards
actually i though the article was pretty constructive meeting up with the two dads of a schoolfriend of my child was pretty straightforward once it became clear who he was talking about when he said pops versus daddy its a modern etiquette issue more than anything
well i am relieved
an animal must adapt to a changing environment if it fails to it will die in that sense evolution has a must
this sounds very authoritarian so are there any examples within the article that suggest any form of compulsion i recently texted a friend to say we must meet up i wasnt suggesting some unwarranted restriction on her freedoms
id be okay with either the key phrase seems to be equally happy which answers your question in itself surely
that was always the plan
i dont think you quite managed to understand the article daily mail ones are shorter and simpler if youre looking for a nice read
presumably barry white deserves production credits on a lot more children then
whilst you might have been trying to undermine my point i think that your examples show that people are able to understand concepts or different usages of language outside of the norm regardless of whether you think polygamy is a good idea you dont get people going but how can he have two wives i dont understand it my concept of language doesnt allow me to do so
i want to fight the tyranny of all titles chair door squirrel etc close that squirrel and sit on your door makes perfect sense to me what are you some kind of fascist
then you are a deluded old bigot which is your right in our tolerant world
bonkers now they want to meddle in our family life too
funnily enough illiberalism is quite keen on imposing things too its just that its fans tend to believe they are so unarguably correct that they are merely proscribing naturalism or the normal which is of course a convenient pretence
point taken it was the use of condone that suggested otherwise
george orwell had a thing or two to say on this subject
we speak of being hardwired to behave in a certain way i hate this metaphor so much that seeing it presented as a reason to change familial language didnt work well on me however many people seem addicted to it so perhaps it was a good choice overall
would any readers have preferred to grow up in a happy supportive etc nontraditional family structure as opposed to an equally happy supportive etc traditional one
invent as many new words as you like just dont expect many people to use them well struggle on with adopted child of a lesbian mum and a cross dressing dad
those are just some starting ideas youve given us im sure you can come up with some more
well written
thats that sort of thing that i was referring to in my last paragraph i think there are a lot of spurious objections to expanding our use of such terms
evolution is a natural thing there is no space for must in evolution when must is used it is an imposition not evolution
says you but then so what youre perfectly free to be part of a nonbroken nuclear family if you wish how will you go about universalising it ban divorce make homosexuality illegal again give us some policies for recreating the bliss of the past
true enough i wasnt seeking to control anyone
i was making a linguistic point but as usual the bigots of the guardian appear
there are parts of the uk where mom is traditional
agreed although youve reminded me of the guy i saw arguing against gay marriage on the basis that a man introducing people to his husband would cause unbearable confusion
as with so much in life it depends even knowing some basic information such as blood groups might rule out possible ancestors and that might still require the descendents to know his and his partners blood group
yeah i know what you mean shakespeare as always is tricksy ive been looking for a chaucer example i cannot find the one i was thinking of but came across this and whoso fyndeth hym out of switch blame they wol come up the pardoners prologue as i said it seems to have been going on for some time ive read good arguments that the use of she or more often he instead of they is a relatively recent development it was ann fisher author of a new grammar  who promoted the convention of using he him and his as pronouns to cover both male and female in general statements such as everyone has his quirks to be precise she says that the masculine person answers to the general name which comprehends both male and female as any person who knows what he says this idea caught on the convention was bolstered by an act of parliament in  in order to simplify the language used in other acts it was decreed that the masculine pronoun be understood to include both males and females the obvious objection to thisobvious now even if it was not obvious thenis that it makes women politically invisible henry hitchings the language wars a history of proper english macmillan  i also remember a feminist campaign from the s of using herm rather than her him hers or his i bet theyre are relieved it never caught on httpsenwikipediaorgwikiherma
fewer people are blinking at the idea of two husbands or two wives so presumably certain mormons and certain muslims would be very progressive as they completely accept this well the latter part anyway after all  progressive is halfway there and you do you accept three or four or five wives if not youre a fuddyduddy
i would imagine that the partner calls the op his husband too
the problem is that liberlism wants to impose things all the time we must use these words and avoid others we must think this way we must must behave that way this sounds very authoritarianlanguage censorship is not a good thing
if youve adopted that way of doing things youre calling them auntie or uncle because you recognise they deserve respect or affection and have chosen to give that title who recognises it everyone no such thing as societal pressure and expectation if youre an indigenous person calling an elder auntie or uncle the fact that they teach and rule on tribal law awards them that respect it might appear to give it to them but does that automatically mean the deserve it you wouldnt get away with calling a judge hey you yes you would maby not at their work but otherwise you can and if they werent up to the task of being a good tribal elder the tribe would have dealt with them you think such people are infallible
whereas noone could ever have lost their livelihood for being gay ie politically incorrect for the time could they have said what they wanted to say not to mention the fact that their was an official theatre censor you are not being honest at least not unless you regard systematic bigotry as a form of good manners
i thought the word guardian solves most problems unless it has a capital g
why
not in all societies by any means
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness i was doing that during my morning meditation didnt reach any meaningful conclusion
i usually call her sarah
no we dont we need to go back to the nonbroken nuclear family
are those two womens children to call themselves brothers they could be siblings so long as neither of them lisps
theres a balance to be found between understanding peoples differences on the one hand and normalizing those differences so that they become often unwise choices for everyone on the other speaking as a conservative society has to have a central frame of reference around which sufficient freedoms and levels of ambiguity exist to allow for creative development there is a world of difference between encouraging acceptance and worshiping divergence
yep language is a free manifestation of our culture and is not going to be changed by ideological minorities eh were making a good go of it so far weve taken marriage who knows whats next
what specific objection do you have to it
all cultures have a form of political correctness is this the common confusion between manners and political correctness  years ago it was thought awful for wellbroughtup people to swear thats manners youd make a bad impression maybe not be invited for dinners be thought weird pc is much more coercive you are just criticised you could lose your livelihood
the vast majority of people are still the offspring of a male and a female who had heterosexual sex at least once
its fine to use in in south africa to mean asians rather than blacks well it was  years ago god knows now ok ill rephrase it i dont think people will get a survival advantage by using the lingo prescribed above better oh wise one either way its not evolution
i dont think saying youve no objection to heterosexual couples is a favourable comment it smacks of suggesting it would be okay to raise an objection and not disapproving is a generous concession
thank you andrew i enjoyed your article but as an unmarried mother who has been in a monogamous relationship with the father of our children for over  years i dont think im missing the points you raise when i comment that i find it slightly ironic that you chose to use the language husband and wife in your article perhaps this was on purpose after all equality of marriage should be celebrated where it existsbut lets not forget that equality of marriage is not legal in all countries namely australia where same sex parents cannot use these terms
yes thats true similarly fewer people are blinking at the idea of two husbands or two wives
yep language is a free manifestation of our culture and is not going to be changed by ideological minorities
sir vivor
relatives should be an encompassing word agreed so should bullshit therefore i would describe this piece as pure bullshit relatively speaking
i cant condone sexual relations outside of marriage of course good job nobody needs your permission then
i know several people who never knew their biological father in every case it left a void in the persons sense of identity this gets back to the idea of what a father or parent is though its important to be aware of ones biological origins but the evidence shows its a mistake to treat the children of single parentsseparated couples as being akin to those raised by samesex couples and so on
i think you need to read darwin again again ive yet to evolve far enough to do it once i prefer to rely on a synopsis in the readers digest
nothing in the article begins to suggest the author wants legal intervention
here you go cuz sother and bister unt and ankle dum and mad
i know several people who never knew their biological father in every case it left a void in the persons sense of identity even if there was no relationship built people instinctively do care who their parents are and will miss their absence
it does matter though it has consistently been found that children having no male influence father figure is damaging particularly for boys but that doesnt have to be present in the form of a father as part of a nuclear couple findings as to children of same sex couples show that this isnt missing and their wellbeing isnt impacted
there are probably better ways of putting what you write or not
i think the fact that everyone except rude people has acclimatised to referring to people by their preferred gender eg we know that transwoman refers to someone born male is evidence that youre right about this
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family i would hope not
oxen are commonly adult male cattle therefore shouldnt the oxford dictionary consider changing its name its true that oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle but that is not good enough and certainly no excuse for another blatant case of misogyny
i have used four question marks in order to stress my eagerness for a response will you please satisfy my curiosity what is it that you cant even psi have refrained from using the extra question marks again now please do answer
its more like how they perceive that it is
the full definition is  having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something a rabid feminist of an animal affected with rabies her mother was bitten by a rabid dog why dog why not a rabid bitch
i prefer shrill misogynists will talk a complete load of bollocks under the rather sad impression that theyre being witty
what like with actual rabies
language is alive and everchanging how would you know that without someone taking the time to document the meanings of words
and since you replied to my last comment twice i will reply to you twiceyou said perhaps because they are approaching this in a neutral fashion amp are not partisans of any ideology this is the crux of my disagreement with you you cannot know this anymore than i can know that they are all frustrated misongynists deliberately trying to belittle women though their authoritative explanations of language yes that was an attempt at humor i hope it is not lost on you i feel it is equally likely that the lexicographers being human and as i posited earlier probably mostly male are bringing their view of what is correct into their work and may be suffering from some gender bias again using as evidence the other examples given in the article
you are creating an impossible standard of course there is no firm objective evidence unless you were to work there you would not know and even if you did work there you still would probably not know because who can map out the prejudices of everyone within an organisationthere is no firm objective evidence possible in this situation and your insisting that those who disagree with you cite such evidence weakens your argument such as it ishowever there seems to be at least circumstantial evidence which is the apparent consistency of sexist terminology within the dictionary while one could argue that this is merely reflective of the sexism of the society as a whole i think that would be disingenuous in this day and age an accurate reflection of language usage would be less sexist than a generation ago frankly the examples included in the article feel about a generation out of date to me on the other hand i dont care enough about the issue to do an exhaustive study of the dictionary in question and catalog all the supporting and conflicting examplesinstead id rather give my opinion which i believe is reasonable even if it does not live up to your impossible standard of acceptability
feminists believe that men and women would behave in almost exactly the same way if they grew up in exactly the same environmental conditions do they blimey thats news to me
how about this for an example sentence rabid feminists do not like being described as such
blimey been doing some work on allophones recently they are doing my head in a bit its no excuse though sorry
any fule kno that a lot of people who wibble on about newspeak have never actually read any orwell
its definitions and spellings do for sure though they also give historical usages for reference im not sure whether representativeness is a main priority when theyre choosing usage examples theyve kind of got a different function
how is society sexist just because women choose not to go into politics perhaps we should be asking why more women choose to go into politics in scandinavia and what should we aim at or shouldnt we bother we bothered about allowing women the vote so why stop there
i didnt btw suggest destroying historical dictionaries but given all the progress in linguistics and the philosophy of language in the th century its strange that there are still academics trying to pin down contemporary meaning as though it were a dessicated butterfly language is alive and everchanging
im guessing you probably learned foreign languages the oldfashioned way as i did modern teaching methods eschew the textbook approach in favour of a more natural oralaural method
i am proabortion in case you are mistaking me for a conservative or republican i am liberal centreleft
surely the dictionary reflects usage rather than vice versa
i see your point but im not sure i agree i suspect there are a lot of factors that go into choosing usage examples and a lot of possible valid choices for each word so avoiding the ones that perpetuate stereotypes wouldnt mean using less appropriate ones just different ones it does bring up a lot of interesting questions and possibilities theres the option of using rabid feminists but flagging it as offensive for instance that would solve the issue youre talking about in your second paragraph about connotations or even use both examples and point out that one is more offensive than the other because dictionaries have gone mostly online now theres no need to limit the usage examples as much as they have historically id hope it would be possible to paint a true picture of the language without perpetuating and therefore validating to some extent the prejudicial connotations some words and phrases have but its definitely a complex issue with a lot of things to be weighed against each other
tell it like it is
thats both good and sad at the same time no one wants people to go through what that generation did on those battlefields but bloody hell what a bunch of moaners we have today whatever makes them feel like they contribute to society i guess
i dont know why youre bothering structured and coherent debate is never going to happen online people just want to shout an opinion have it believed and move on if you disagree with them youre the one thats an arse because apparently you should sit and agree with them at all times its dangerously common in every day as well as if each individual holds their own opinions to be infallible and you must do likewise
and prochoice
hblov just mentioned hysterical get this from the oed online hysteria n pathol a functional disturbance of the nervous system characterized by such disorders as anæsthesia hyperæsthesia convulsions etc and usually attended with emotional disturbances and enfeeblement or perversion of the moral and intellectual faculties also called colloquially hystericswomen being much more liable than men to this disorder it was originally thought to be due to a disturbance of the uterus and its functions  that assertion ive put in italics really does need revising in my view or at least qualifying along the lines of something like women allegedly being unlike the other examples that have been mentionedwhich were exactly that ed examplesthis is part of the definition to be absolutely fair though the oed has a red box next to the entry saying this entry has not yet been fully updated first published 
it is if youre discussing guardian articles
with a name like omanreagan youre destined to be a drama king
i have never thought of it ill try change but if the woman is rabid and has a shrill voicei will say so
in what way is my argument speciousfeminists believe that men and women would behave in almost exactly the same way if they grew up in exactly the same environmental conditions so when they come across language that challenges their world view they try and shut it down you can only change what people believe by arguing against these stereotypes trying to protect people from the truth never works remember the tale the emperors new clothes
good luck when you are learning a foreign language or refining your understanding of your own and all the dictionaries have been burnt or wiped from the web unless intended ironically this is beyond ridiculous as well as anachronistically postmodern
but in both cases the power is with the person who typically in society would be deemed to be the minority if sexism equals prejudice plus power then both are examples of sexism i dont see what is wrong with the existing definitions im fine with qualifiers being added to the words to denote the type of sexism eg institutional or systemic but trying to wholly change the meaning to exclude certain victims is quite a worrying idea sadly from what i see a lot of people intent on these new versions seem to be motivated by the intention of legitimising prejudice that isnt against minorities bahar mustafa being a related example where some deemed it acceptable for her to be prejudiced because it wasnt racist or sexist as if the semantics had any bearing on her actual behaviour
spicy
i you learn spacial awareness you can skip all that other nonsense
get rid of it then time for a thorough purge of the language get rid of all those embedded misogynist and racist metaphors shoot the clocks comrades
a fallacy of post hoc ergo prompter hoc 
he probably wanted to ask four questions but started typing from the end of the questions and forgot about it when getting past the question mark
you seem to really enjoy trying to pick apart everyones statements if by this you mean to say that i subject them to rigourous analysis then guilty as charged some arbitrary rules of engagement that you seem to feel apply also known as logic i didnt join your junior debating league neither did i my undergraduate degree was in mathematics though this probably has something to do with it in this sense the word rabid is dismissive of the legitimacy of feminism as a philosophy it was intended as an example of usage not an assertion of fact
why sneer at equality like that are you afraid of it
transmissible transmittable and now a new adjective transmissable english language and its felicity make me happy 
you are talking nonsense george orwell repeatedly risked his life to kill right wing junkit is you who is using newspeak with your spurious examples and twisted language george orwell was a socialist who joined poum party of marxist unity in spain which was a trotsky inspired anti stalinist party during the spanish civil war before he wrote  orwell had already broken with stalinism exposing it for the counter revolution that it was and popularized the term state capitalist to describe stalins russia this was the position of most socialists in europe including the labour party in the s george orwell was a socialist and on the side of feminism and equal rights against the bankster and tory tabloid bs he despised shooting right winger bigots to death as orwell did is about as tough a pc position as it is possible to get
given that there are always multiple usage options to choose between i dont know what the problem is with having appropriateness as one of many considerations it just seems like a kneejerk reaction to being asked to think about the actual social effect of language the problem is simply this to the extent it conflicts with the main purpose of the dictionary and so results in different choices it weakens the dictionary and if it never results in different choices being made there is no point using it as a criterion theres nothing kneejerk about this at all it just comes from giving some thought to what a dictionary is for in this case you could replace rabid feminist with rabid football fan and it seems that is what they might do but the word takes on a slightly different meaning doesnt it where someone says rabid feminist the word is significantly ruder and more dismissive than where someone says rabid football fan in the latter the usage is probably a little ironic so the example is less pertinent to the main metaphorical meaning of the word still including either would be a reasonable decision and a dictionary cant cover everything the point is just that the selection is not a neutral one in lexicographical terms if the principle was applied consistently through the dictionary the dictionary would not paint a true picture of the language
what a ridiculous comment
serious question what about a word like hysterical given its etymology id imagine that its an insulting and demeaning word
i have flown over newfoundland and have a couple pictures to prove it in light of what i saw i am not surprised that an academic living there comes up with some weird ideas the one colour landscape would drive me nuts as well
its not about whether or not such is insulting rather its that the lexicographers are subjective too claim just doesnt seem to me to be a very strong argument to make against oxford dictionaries in this case
looks like the public cutting out of tongues may be on the agenda
you said it in the sentence thats prejudiced theres many other words for it but its not sexism sexism and racism carry far more a weight than that as youve said power is a complicated dynamic
good on you for putting that woman in her place how dare she express her own independently sourced and articulated opinion thats not what modern feminism is about
so you admit that you would be fine with apparent bias if it were focused on a different group of people that you didnt like i suspect you have a lot of company in that regard
bugger is nothing sacred any more a politically correct dictionary how bloody awful that makes me remember the following e woman was gods second mistakefriedrich nietzsche couldnt the bugger learn from the first mistake
nouns are also gender neutral it doesnt take much to rephrase a sentence language matters why do you put feminist instead of feminist i can throw my energies equally into fighting for better living standards for all women and into objecting to demeaning language at the moment women in positions of influence whether internationally nationally or locally can so easily be slapped back down to our biology with ridicule in language it seems to yourself that i would be a feminist unconcerned with children or men the improvement in womens status and living standards will automatically lift up children and men there is no permanent nit picking exercise there is a need to advance women in all spheres and that includes calling out sexist language
amazing work
ah i actually wasnt arguing either side of this debate when i pointed out that lexicography isnt a field you can be fully objective in i was just disagreeing with your reply to phyllisaufeu about how this is objective lexical accuracy vs subjective ideological feels and i dont see subjectivity as automatically worse than objectivity so i didnt realise you thought i was insulting or undermining lexicographers by saying theres subjectivity involved
depends what the language youre controlling is doesnt it so you accept that feminists are trying to control the use of language so those fighting against it are pro liberty
okay now weve got something to work with here go to google and type rabid it is not followed by feminist in any of the top results if you type rabid f the only result not having to do with the disease rabies is rabid fan but of course google is but one source that can be drawn upon amp they doubtlessly use others also the idea that they choose merely frequency is probably incorrect i would guess that they aim to provide examples that cover the breadth of the words use amp as rabid is often paired with words denoting an ideology they may well have wished to include an ism amongst their examples why would oxford dictionaries and not the oed as has been pointed out in other comments choose to use rabid feminist as an example phrase when it is clearly not the most common example and in fact seems to imply an editorial point of view on the part of the dictionary perhaps because they are approaching this in a neutral fashion amp are not partisans of any ideology regardless of which ism they may have chosen the partisans of that ism would not be amused however today i think that it would be considered inappropriate to use that term in a dictionary and i think that rabid feminist falls into the same category and heres the crux of it the methodology they used has in this case run afoul of some subjective standard of pejorative usage to which you amp certain other like minded netizens ascribe and as a result you have called into to question the objectivity of their methodology amp judgement but still have no firm objective evidence to demonstrate this there you go
they are sexist but that doest mean that censorship is the answer we should criticise them not try to edit them to our current standard of political correctness
i dont really think that americans have a monopoly on being offended it seems just as bad this side of the pond from what i can tell and the article only talked about a canadian getting offended
thank you mr omanreagan
isnt it time we abandoned dictionaries altogether linguistics has moved on since the th century and its now widely accepted that words dont have fixed meanings
ltnitpickgt headline says sexism row prompts oxford dictionaries to review language used in definitions but article is about language used in examples not definitions ltnitpickgt
i know exactly what equal means and thus i find it farcical that feminists want equality when men and women are not equal
you do realize that controlling the use of language is regressive completely specious argument when stripped of any context just a deflection tactic not a logically coherent argument depends what the language youre controlling is doesnt it
the source of this rancour seems to be that some people feel that too many examples from the dictionary in question run afoul of a certain subjective interpretation of sexism which itself is a rather subjective concept and thus have concluded that this in and of itself must be evidence of some serious flaw in the methodology used by oxford dictionaries you seem to be trying to argue away this obvious weakness in the arguments made against oxford dictionaries by claiming that their lexicographers are also subjective again without making a strong case that their subjectivity approaches that of their accusers its as though you are making a rather bizarre attempt to level the playing field so to speak by arguing that all are equally subjective amp insisting that expertise must be held in suspicion sorry i just dont see how thisll work
what if a prejudiced female judge was to give a harsher sentence to a man than she would a woman what if a prejudiced stepmother was abusive to her stepson but not her stepdaughter sexism is prejudice against a gender im not one of those people who is going to argue that it effects men anywhere near as much as it does women but it has nothing to do with these illdefined and spurious power dynamics that certain types of academics advocate power is much too complicated a subject to be so easily defined
i yield to nobody in my support for equal rights but what a lot of silliness can result must we expect a pc shakespeare say perhaps edited not to offend americans bottom in the dream offers to roar like any sucking dove will sucking be altered to suckling as in suckling pig forsooth since the original reminds our poor squeamish cousins ofyou know what and this even though their films make use of the fword in every other sentence and no i do not intend to purchase the revised edition of huckleberry finn tampering with classic texts is a criminal act and so closer and closer we come to having to learn the newspeak so dismally foreseen by george orwell life imitates art
you seem to really enjoy trying to pick apart everyones statements and then fault them for not following some arbitrary rules of engagement that you seem to feel apply im just an opinionated person mouthing off on a comment section as are you i didnt join your junior debating league so i dont really give a shit what you think is irrelevant or notbut let me spell it out for you i agree with the comments made by the anthropologist because i think they are valid as an indicator of the frequency of usage if you go to google and type rabid it is not followed by feminist in any of the top results if you type rabid f the only result not having to do with the disease rabies is rabid fan rabid used to describe a feminist is clearly a pejorative because rabid implies an unthinking fanaticism which is more appropriately applied to a sports fan than someone who subscribes to an intellectual line of inquiry in this sense the word rabid is dismissive of the legitimacy of feminism as a philosophy why would oxford dictionaries and not the oed as has been pointed out in other comments choose to use rabid feminist as an example phrase when it is clearly not the most common example and in fact seems to imply an editorial point of view on the part of the dictionary why choose the more controversial and less common example if it is not reflecting some lexicographers opinion in some wayif the usage example for the word shiftless was shiftless negro do you think that would go unchallenged it was certainly in common usage as a term not that long ago however today i think that it would be considered inappropriate to use that term in a dictionary and i think that rabid feminist falls into the same category the anthropologist then followed up his initial criticism with a selection of other examples that indicated what he saw as a gender bias on the part of the publisher maybe he was cherry picking i dont know but the end result seems to be that the dictionary is going to have a look and see if they feel there is any merit to the argument whats the problem with that
i havent no i doubt it would make me reconsider what i said either
what are they going to do when they leave their freakishly farleft bubble and enter the real world
you do realize that controlling the use of language is regressive along with much of the remaining aspects of feminism in the uk endlessly pushed by the media for example i grew up in a christian family where critisism of god and words like fuck etc where dealt with harshly similar to many authoritarian regemes around the globe where any critisizm of god or the state often viewed as the same thing or anything which the ruling elite find offensive will be punished severely
but equal does not mean identical as i suspect even the oed will show you
so in your eyes the only true centrists read the morning star and the socialist worker
please look up equal in the oed it doesnt mean identical
sorry about the typo wag not wage of course
give it time you might benefit from it besides your response was also judgmental although you may not realize it
i like the idea of living on an amateur basis i doubt you can be convinced about the partial subjectivity of lexicography though short of a fully footnoted and referenced page essay also i havent seen anyone arguing that a twitter storm or it just doesnt feel right is compelling evidence of anything i dont think anybodys even arguing that the usage example is an error a poor choice at worst
i had always assumed a rabid feminist was a consequence of the tail trying to wage the dog
funny i always thought shrill was an adjective
your definition covers one usage only and not very well at that because it is wholly slanted in a single direction rabid has more than one meaning and in its metaphorical usage describes varying degrees of intensity like so many words it can be derogatory or affectionate depending on the context if dictionaries were to use definitions like yours they would have to be rewritten annually
i still have my mcp tie that a girl friend bought me for xmas in the s it would probably get me sacked if i worked for a major corporation or town council these are the same places that allow women to cover their faces of course
critics should also bear in mind that the oed examples carry dates this tells us how the words were used at various times in their history so far as rabid feminists are concerned there were some around in the s i worked with one whose feminism destroyed her marriage and her life a great pity but someone like that can only be described as rabid although it is only a metaphor on this context
if historical language had not been rewritten over the centuries wed not have the influences of shakespeare and uk and australian english would use program not programme for example
exactly
no i dont pretend that not at all your seem to be suggesting that this whole discussion is a waste of time and resources and yet you are taking part in it
why did you use  question marks
pointing out that subjectivity is pretty baked in to lexicographys history and not down to the ideological hacks of our age you pointed to one person who lived amp worked on an amateur basis before any modern conception of lexicography even existed this hardly suffices as a basis to assert that subjectivity is pretty baked in or to otherwise argue that a twitter storm or it just doesnt feel right is compelling evidence of an error of oxford dictionaries part
the problem is the micromanagement trying to sanitize every little opposition to your worldview that is the problem not the definition but you types need to be countered any time you dont make sense because maybe it will make some of you see reason low success rates but still worth it sometimes
yes
 the oed isnt allowed to make examples no matter how correct they might be they take usages from the current or older literature to illustrate how the word is used and when it was first used in that way good lexicography is indeed using key core examples that reflect how people use the words descriptive not prescriptive without looking i havent and i bet you havent either we dont know if there are perfectly ok exemplars of the word in use as well without looking we dont know if there are sexist examples for men eg for obsessively he obsessively counted his collection of toy soldiers
how is society sexist just because women choose not to go into politics like i said its complex you shouldnt just aim for  and call it a good target unless you want to change the very way women prioritise their lives that seems sketchy
finally one very sensible comment
are the feminists going to ask for the word pig to be unlinked from the phrase male chauvinist well they certainly would not dare to use it to describe the gentlemen chauvinists of the faith that must not be named or shamed though id like to see them try
you cant even what
it seems there are a lot of rabid antifeminists on cif im glad to see that progressive changes are being made
oh i see samuel johnsons two hundred year old dictionary was massivelly subjective therefore modern dictionaries produced by oxford dictionaries are also subjective do you see where you went wrong here i was replying to your the subjective how do i feel standards that are all the rage amongst the ideological hacks of our age pointing out that subjectivity is pretty baked in to lexicographys history and not down to the ideological hacks of our age as im sure you know so i suspect where i went wrong was engaging you in good faith
wonderful
if it is already a cliché why there is no compulsory disclosure of sex orientation on your jobs agreement
the words we use matter just ask a teenagerimoif you need a teenagers advice on this youve got tons of problems to solvenot the least of which is thanks to the internet more people than ever are talking before thinking at allimo
comments on this thread will close shortly thanks for your contributions
toughen up snowflakes
to tell the truth i skimmed that post
meaning most people are hypocrites riding high horses i agree wholeheartedly with that assessment
not just australia either
i look at the new language of the corbyn crew melts slugs gammon and see a discourse of contempt perhaps you just dont get how they can be deployed in consistence with corbynite ethics i heard its ok to call someone a melt if they back policy that a socialist analysis shows would cause much greater harm than the harm caused by calling someone a melt
i am informed that i am the worst feminist of all time this is hardly the first time this accusation has been levelled at me yet evidently none of those times including this time have you taken it seriously and considered it to be a charge you need to refute as if you consider the criticism widely exaggerated and that his is clear to all which we might refer to as political correctness gone mad
for reference httpswwwstandardcouknewsalanhansensmatchofthedayblunderinracismrowhtml
nonsequitur you do know that a non sequitur is a statement that doesnt follow logically from a previous one and that while you mentioned another bovine the gender difference is all important i said cow meaning cow and i didnt use the word genitalia but a four letter word middle english of germanic origin
ok i qwanted that whilst crossing my fingers it wasnt some hideously inappropriate acronym not entirely sure what your point is though
so youre not scared of children kudos
karma is a bitch
again thats just a fact of life i dont disagree with that as a truism you were just very definite when you said people judge you on what you say i just dont think thats entirely true if i say im a socialist how many people will take that to mean that im a fan of stalin and mao agree too many people will tell you why youre wrong without looking to understand why youre a socialist and exactly what you mean now i would say i come from the other side of the political spectrum to you but if someone consciously decides they are a socialist i would always be interested in understanding why
hes ing john wayne
yes they are they form the cabinet
chaps you dont get to tell women how to do feminism its surely sexist to simply assume that matthew parrish might not be better at feminism than you just because hes a man given that you are in your own daughters words the worst feminist of all time he almost certainly its
you do know that the use of orwell to make a case is now akin to the use of hitler its the new referent for godwins
but it was muslims that george was talking about specifically yusuf islam not their religion
its almost as if the insulters didnt know what they believed in they know exactly what they believe in thuggery to get what they consider to be equality which to the hard left consistently is equality of outcome rather than of opportunity and regardless of effort put in
and if of course they dont get over themselves they come and write opinion pieces for the guardian
yeah that bloody craft beer taking our jobs houses and benefits no youll have to do better that really didnt mean anything
you cant tell the difference between a joke and reality so perhaps its your comment that sums it up best could you perhaps point out the bit that shows that this is a joke rather than reality sounds more like you cant comprehend reality and are trying to make out it is just a joke
i resent that the words at in and on have all been replaced with just in
she may be small but i reckon she roots for the team
did you not notice its an article on language
which are the new notso secret police much used in australia to maintain the grounds of prestigious universities police car parking and at the same time run effective concentration camps in the south pacific
they judge you on what they think you mean when you say something again thats just a fact of life if i say im a socialist how many people will take that to mean that im a fan of stalin and mao
inclusiveness and solidarity almost elided here is a distinction to meditate on the latter which in the political sense of it denotes agency and decision seems to have been substituted and subsumed by the former which denotes the strange desire to compete to be yet another recognised part of the ruling status quo its distinction with real difference and such are more than words
the fear that using a single word could get you reprimanded dismissed even youre not going to get fired for using a term thats a bit anachronistic though you might recieve some doubtful looks if you use a term thats clearly insulting you might be but thats no different than what would happen to you if you call someone an idiot or a prick
i used to call donald trump a gimp but i was informed that this is a disablist term rather than something from bdsm practice news to me too there was an article here recently about how the word marijuana was supposed to be racist as wellamateur etymologists who insist that words are problematic because of their history rather than their current consensual meaning seem to me to get language spectacularly wrong they fail to understand what words actually are and how they work
this is the simple reality people judge you on what you say often thats not true they judge you on what they think you mean when you say something so what youre saying is they have prejudged your response to fit into their ire
well obviously
there is something very sad if defenders of political correctness among whom i count myself make no attempt to infer intent and bring no generosity of spirit in inferring it but insist on a punctilious observance of form i loved that
we should not allow random people to attach negative connotations to what is simply a valid word in the english language but the word immigrant has undoubtedly been given negative connotations and it certainly wasnt social justice warriors who did it
i loved this article so good i havent laughed out loud in a while thank you
this is not a rant about political correctness which to me is basically good manners yes exactly and the basic purpose of any etiquette is to separate the savvy and privilege them above the uncouth every etiquette defines an underclass the divide now is not merely between generations but through tertiary education this too reinforces social class as well in fairly obvious ways once again an elite asks to be admired for their superior taste and righteousness
i hope your teachings better than your insults because thats pretty close to a nonsequitur do you mean bulls or are cows particularly renowned for the size of their vulvas youd surely have to have an outsized interest in the matter to know this which may explain why your students were somewhat confused by your professed expertise
im mix race and that was the terminology that we used in school and all my peers use it but i think thats fallen out of fashion now too my gran still says half caste even though we try and tell her thats not acceptable anymore she doesnt mean it nastily but thats just what they used to say back then and its been hard to shift and political language is hugely important the right slogan can take you far if it captures the imagination of the people corbyns for the many not the few doesnt really roll of the tongue and is all round a bit shit he needs something punchy self contained and easily understandable change make america great again etc the current slogan sounds too philosophicalintellectual
yer heids a marley son was one my mother regularly applied to me
but it does sound like a useless security company
i refuse to let my life be defined by a bunch of young punks just learned to walk and talk
islamophobia is or should be a fear of islam not a hatred of muslims ive known quite a few muslims who dont believe in islam very much
yeah if you ever want to find out whos really doing all the good work in this world just look for the folks being blithely obnoxious im sure theres a strong positive correlation there
if you were old enough to remember what life was like in the uk before pc you wouldnt think that it was truly sickening
im pretty sure its widely recognised that phillips role is to say vile stuff in order to absorb all criticism of the royal family by reliably playing the part of the casually cruel and racist uncle he effectively launders the air of those surrounding him by comparison its been a pretty successful tactic but every story that gleefully reports on his dumb pseudogaffes makes the ongoing shell game that bit more effective
duly noted you clearly have your finger on the pulse
as i live with a social justice warrior a teenager i feel increasingly dukey for the first time in my life i feel sorry for a guardian journalist
surely a blunt is a specific type ie made with a single skin are rizlas still called skins zoot is a new one on me anything to do with zoot suits
a blunt wasis that small cigar
wow im impressed when do you get your medal for heroism in the face of snowflakery
 a hill of beans  you cant use the b word anymore they are legume seeds
im politically incorrect and im proud the sanctimonious young and old alike should be told not to be so uptight and certainly shouldnt be able to hound people from their jobs when it comes tohumouranything goes acceptable then is acceptable now and vice versa
of course that is the purpose
amadan meaning a simpleton is also a good one
its not so much the indiginity as the fear that using a single word could get you reprimanded dismissed even add in that the words differ over time and change their meaning it is quite a real fear in some situations eg the typical contemporary office
teenagers do tend to be a bit stroppy coz of hormones n stuff i imagine the rightwing ones are at least as annoying as the pc variety
how much of it is serious though assuming you mean how much of the language policing is serious i would say thats not really the point that many people who currently seek to do it will probably grow out of it does not change its futility or make it less counter productive it seems unlikely to me that a generation raised by women at the home and in education and who have lived in a multiracial country all their lives are going to be the holders of racist or sexist views in any large number i hope youre right but im pretty sure that at the time people would have said much the same of the children and young adults who were the product of the s and s
a blunt specifically was made by taking a small cigar slice it open remove the tobacco leaves fill with weed and then walk about openly smoking it in disguise
i called them zoots when i was a teenager in the late s i assumed that had gone out of fashion blunts is a us import for sure they use it in south america too
a lot of everything that goes on is fashion for most people even the best and most important ideas and stands taken are only deeply followed by an authentic self sacrificing long term few while the rest pick up the politics and language of the day and wear it as a mind che tshirt its rebel consumerism exactly what the society loves cause  then move steadily along to status quo satisfaction the baby boom generation were a prime example the people who after haight ashbury went on to substantially create the world of 
when i was a teenager if id yelled anything at my mother i would have been in serious trouble
if people call you racist its probably because thats what they think if you have the right to express your opinion they have the right to express theirs thats what free speech means this is the simple reality people judge you on what you say many of them will disagree with you and some wont be polite about it thats the case whatever your politics might be
i like gombeen meaning one who exploits the poor theres also gossoon for a childlike man im sure this must be related somehow to french garcon
i maintain that remain would have won if it had not chosen such an idiotic passive emotionless word for its stance i dont think it was the word but the underlying stance of well we should just smile and go wherever the eu wants to and keep paying for the privilege a remain for now but work for reform and ever closer union must never mean a federal state stance would have gotten a much stronger remain response
when i was a teenager gay meant happy cheerful carefreeand im afraid i still use it in that way
naacp stands for what
i would upvote you but my wrist is a bit sore
i remember when i was young and dumb as shit no one has to bend over backwards to accommodate that in anyone
pissed means angry to a lot of them now and as for fags
apostrophile
its true i really didnt give it the respectful time and thought required
the word your looking for in relation to hatred of muslims is islamophobia im quite surprised youve not come across it before
you might be right but careful with folk etymology on the internet i just looked at the oed entries for git and its original form get basically means child if theres a reference to extramarital offspring the oed researchers missed which is not of course impossible
as the standard bearer for jokes you wont get
there already in fact been there since i was  life is so much easier
how much of it is serious though most of the online stuff is done by the young and it seems unlikely to me that a generation raised by women at the home and in education and who have lived in a multiracial country all their lives are going to be the holders of racist or sexist views in any large number reckon a fair amount of the stuff you see is simply what has always happened one generation mocking the social mores of its parents
either theres no real setagreed upon acronym although queer seems the most common one
teenagers dont need to be told to get stuffed theyll do it on their own
i remain baffled by the q is it meant to be queer or questioning or both
can i say git i love the word git i suppose you can but youd be using an insult that just like bastard has its historical roots in the misogynistic oppression of patriarchy so youd therefore be colluding with that patriarchy parklife a shortening of beget get insinuates that the recipient is someones misbegotten offspring and therefore a bastard someplace on the internet
its not so much teenagers per se that cause fear of but the ideology they embrace and not just teenagers of course good article the other day by lionel shriver on how the cold hand of political correctness is stifling literaturehttpswwwtheguardiancombooksfeblionelshriversayspoliticallycorrectcensorshipisdamagingfiction some artists like stewart lee may thrive in such a milieu but not all do
i think the tendency to police vocabulary over message is incredibly counter productive the sad reality is that for decades bigotry particularly racism and sexism was policed through socialization and restricting language while i dont doubt the percentage of the population who are actively ist or phobic insert ignorance of choice is lower than it was   years ago the harsh reality is that we clearly still have a significant proportion of people who are as bigoted as ever but have been taught to hide it pretty effectively in inperson interactions the anonymity offered by on line interactions enables these people to spew their invective and mobilize with others of their ilk without fearing a direct social consequence and thus we see the rise of sectarianism we need to address intolerance of all kinds at its root and stop simply policing language and thus encouraging people to disguise their true selves
in a restaurant if i am in mixed company and the waitresswaiter calls us guys then i dont leave a gratuity as a matter of principle
rather than lgbtqipo i thought it was lgbtqiaa try gsd gender and sexuality diversity not bogstandard hetero not stereotypical mascfem unless youre trans of course when stereotypical mascfem is ok gsd rolls off the tongue doesnt it and does not sound at all like some countrys secret police force
theres nothing left to tryyyyyyyytheres no place left toooo hiiiiiiidetheres no greater power then the power offfff goodbyeeeeee
i assume you are holding stewart up as the standard bearer for right thinking
what about me telling someone to sod or bugger off am i guilty of homophobia by using a derogatory term referring to gay sex am i contributing to the lack of bi visibility by using the term gay sex have i just reached the age where i no longer know or much care how the world works any longer
my millenial stepdaughter says pants instead of trousersi despair
indeed
i hadnt thought of that
wonder if she believes the reverse is true all a gay man needs is half a lager and hell be positively agog at the prospect of fanny
a few years ago alan hanson i think was castigated for saying someone was a coloured person i found a lot of the criticism a bit over the top i appreciate the term has historical connotations which mean its use is neither sensitive nor sensible however some of the comments were along the lines of oh what colour am i exactly bearing in mind this paper has many articles referring to people of colour i think a bit more thought sometimes needs to be attached to the intention of the speaker i have no idea of hansons private thoughts but hes never come across to me as someone significantly prejudiced that being said i have heard clearly prejudiced people claim not to understand why people get upset when they use terms widely considered unacceptable i suppose my point is that if those people stop using those terms it doesnt make them less of a prick than someone who thoughtlessly uses an incorrect term
until recently he him man mankind etc were considered inclusive of both sexes when used in certain context for example the american looks to government to guarantee his liberty would include both male and female americansit is only in the past  years that there has been any concern about gender neutral pronouns
language matters
but male words that have a highvalue female equivalent
sorry but im talking about prison governesses not sarah palin the expression prison governess certainly exists see link below and a prison governess presumably has the same power as a prison governor having said that i imagine the word governess in this context is disappearing due to pc demands httpwwwimdbcomtitlett
the language is crying out for it and yet doesnt have it i agree they is clumsy and should be kept for plurals hen is beginning to be adopted in sweden to much opposition as an english equivalent would be i really dont understand why theres such hostility to a useful addition to the grammar
thats a few articles now that stem from complaints about the sexism of the phrase rabid feminist which clearly isnt sexist at all as not only can men be feminists most women are not feminists further the problem with twitter complaints about something so trivial are twitter complaints ever anything but trivial is that you bring something to the awareness of people who previously couldnt care less sure odo might be reviewing their definitions but type keyword rabid into google now and rabid feminist is the third option that comes up after the word rabid on its own and rabid definition which leaves you with a little box that to the previously unaware simply says rabidrabid definitionrabid feministrabid dog great job twitterati thatll put feminists in a positive light didnt backfire at all did it in fact it happens with such regularity that one wonders whether such backfiring was actually the intended consequence all along either that or the twitter outraged really are that dumb
quick ban the dictionary
interesting thanks i used to go out with an american when our kitchen was falling apart he said we should send for the cowboys to fix it almost exactly the opposite meaning in our two varieties of english
you dont seem to have got the point at all governess is not in itself pejorative but given that it began as the female equivalent of governor which implies a reasonable size of operation being governed its transformation into a word describing the woman teaching one or possibly two children is surely noteworthy as for spinster why is this a position that needed a word whats wrong with woman the need to define women by their marital status is clear and that aint about equality just note mr for all men unless they have a specific title while women where always mrs or miss depending on their marital status thank goodness ms came along but is still mocked by men who can only see women in terms of availability confirmed bachelor not a term ive seen in the last decade was not used for all unmarried men was it now
it would certainly hasten the guardians slide into irrelevance to use another language to make it complete they should invent one themselves
vamp
whats wrong with humans or humankind it feels weird to be on the side of the feminists theyre being very reasonable for a change though
no its not mankind represents the human species
oh uh another article to get angry men even angrier tin hat time
one word which reveals the problem of a certain english male mangina
more whataboutery the article isnt particularly worked up about semantics and id suggest that your restrictions on when outrage or in this case mild commentary on sexism can legitimately be applied would suggest noone can remark upon sexism unless it is as bad as a rape gang
you are bringing slang into the discussion that is a wholly different set if usages for words and you are missing the whole point of the oed it does not ease words along into perjorative meanings it reflects the usage if the current rumpus succeeds in changing what the oed does we might just as well throw all our copies into the bonfire forget the whole enterprise and return to the days before dr johnson lets just use words to mean whatever the hell we think they do and it wont be too much worse than it is today
skipping the obvious arse id suggest nutter which was apparently used as a reference to a person who gathers nuts you dont get that many ladies called those
actually an interesting article if youre interested in language but as often the headline gets in the way and is really there as comment bait sexism surely is an attitude or behaviour a language is capable of neither the language may reveal sexism in sections of society but to say sexism is at the heart of the language is bullshit apologies for using a male derogatory term to be fair the writer says this in the article its the headline writer thats the dick
which is why we should all be called menactually just to be on the safe side we could eradicate sexism altogether if we were all called women xoxo
haha good own up i first heard schlampe when watching south park in german cartmans mama ist eine schlampe
why does nobody wonder why rabid and feminist were used together why not gentle feminist or thought invoking feminist why is that 
is it the s again are we back to arguing about history or herstory
he studied linguistics the article is about the evolution of language and sociolinguistics perhaps not your cup of tea but its certainly a subject that matters to many where did i say that i thought sociolinguistics and the evolution of language werent worth studying and what or where david shariatmadari studied is irrelevant pieces have to be judged individually and on their own merits and this article has few if any things to recommend it
wouldnt a woman who runs a presumably female prison be a governess toono absolutely not as the word governess has no power or prestige attacked when sarah palin leaving aside whatever you think of her politics was elected to govern alaska she was absolutely not governess palin she was governor palin the male form has the power and prestige in our fairer modern society thankfully women can get some share of the power and prestige but when they do they use the male titles the female ones were stripped of their worth long ago
id be willing to bet a sum of money that the author if he looked would be able fairly easily to discover eight words referring to men where pejoration has taken place over time so thats a vote of confidence in the author i think despite this horribly under researched article which is nevertheless well written
i believe it is now a requirement to refer to it as a chalkboard
sadly it wouldnt release us from the sexism all around us as evidenced in this idiotic comment
i dont think we live etc
id agree but say it was both ways pace wittgenstein i dont live in a world that is entirely constructed out of our own language there is an outthere reality that we rub up against which affects us or at least affected past societies in ways which were deemed better or worse and therefore required some opprobrium or stigmatisation if these words are now a hangover then they tend to fall out of fashion but sexual mores are always going to be fraught
i never heard anyone assume woman after the often pejorative use of macho
i couldnt believe this so i looked it up turns out women are more likely to abuse kids than men of kids abused in the states in   were abused by women  by men loads of other evidence if you bother to look
taking it like a woman is ann oakleys book all about her life how she came to be a feminist and what feminism means in that passage shes talking about her school it was all girls and the teachers i think were all women shes speculating maybe they were all feminists we werent i dont know whether rabid has a negative connotation or not in this context or whether she is knowingly deliberately using it to appropriate it at the end of the book she discusses in depth how the usage of certain words is associated with a particular way of looking at things and how feminists are discussing exactly this issue i find oxford dictionaries choice of a e from a book written in  as an example of current usage very odd to say the least their initial flippant response to the person who started off this whole kerfuffle michael omanreagan is also unprofessional if only there were a word to describe how strongly you felt about feminism
mistress spinster and madam continue to have multiple meanings in current usage tart is not used exclusively to denigrate women it is a word used regularly in cookery a good dictionary will give all the meanings a word has or has ever had to be helpful to an educated person how usage is reflected in the oeds ations is part of that publications historical apparatus those es must never be altered simply to reflect how present day people feel about a word and its uses that brings objectivity into disrepute by making it a mere tool of the political correctness of the present rather than criticize the individual at the oed who chose the example of rabid feminist we should be glad of that choice if as is being suggested it is a sexist usage and that our language reflects sexism then the choice of a sexist example can only be viewed as a perfect historical choice even when the history is just a couple of decades old and so far as this particular example is concerned there are many women who are critical of the rabid feminist political correctness functions well when it makes us aware of the sensitivities and problems other people face we should be made to think about people in wheelchairs and create spaces that make it possible for a wheelchair user to function as fully as possible however there are many instances in which political correctness seems to be used by people who refuse to accept the world as it really is and i draw the line at being required to lie to myself and the people with whom i communicate nor do i wish to be lied to and especially not by a dictionary like the oed on which i rely for accuracy and lack of bias
there was a quiz in which one of the questions was what name for a disreputable person could also be found in a garden shed the answer they were looking for was rake but the person did reply with ho and was given the point
the idea that x is fine if y is worse aka whataboutery is one the most idiotic logical fallacies i have ever encountered
thank goodness rabid feminists dont truly exist nor misandry 
lad once an innocuous reference to a younger man now used to talk about a potential rapist steady on thats taking it a bit far
thats your proof just because i dislike one article doesnt mean that i dont like this newspaperwebsite in general in fact there is much to recommend it the graun including the sport coverage the investigative journalism eg phone hacking some of the live blogs the mad men one was especially good and many of the series such as the superb silent but deadly fortnightly pieces on silent cinema however there is also just as much to dislike in many of the opinion pieces and the grauns blind spot when it comes to islam certain kinds of feminism as well as what seems like an anticorbyn agenda odd coming from a supposedly leftleaning publication this piece i disagree with and dislike intensely and appears to have an agenda
what about all men are created equal blah blah blah it should say all humans are created equal when the words menman are used it is male not female
the cabbie might indeed call me guvnor as im a man it comes from the historical term of respect and power would he call a woman guvnor nope this is the historical legacy of sexism the male form of the word means power prestige respect the female form means takes care of a kid again its the same word the process happensyes words evolve how they evolve illustrates society that the female forms were stripped of their power and prestige while the male forms kept them shows sexism
sexually and you get your information from where and youre defending men here on this topic even though theyve been getting away with it for eons speechless
double plus ungood
git bore tosser numpty plank ogre tyrant psycho knuckle dragger bonehead oik lout manchild etc off the top of my head seem predominantly aimed at men in a derogatory fashion and in far more common use than those listed atl bit of lost cause this one i reckon gu
well yes he she it are all pronounced the same in mandarin but if im mistaken about the female businessman then well its something i learned a long time ago while working in quanzhou and the spoken languages in quanzhou not equivalent to queens english
how reassuring to see that the grauniad pseudofeminists are getting upset about semantics again outrage must of course be directed toward fair game such as words in a dictionary and never at the actions of actual systematic industrial scale rape gangs all in the name of community cohesion of course a sense of proportion is of course the pseudofeminists worst enemy over to you we havent debated the depictions of women on banknotes in a while
its rarely used to excuse rape but more often to excuse sexual harassment or assault see also hes just having a laugh etcin my experience bossy is more often applied to women but that isnt to say that similar behaviour isnt looked down on in men
wouldnt a woman who runs a presumably female prison be a governess too
no they dont since they havent become more pejorative over time try reading the article
whats so hard to understand how it is that so many people can have such a total overreaction to this article
you can disagree with the content of the articles or the date when they appeared but tedbullpitt was saying these events were not covered i disproved that unfounded allegation have a nice day
thanks i now have a new name for my band the pop snorkels
dont flatter yourself im not offended by your paper tiger collection just mildly irritated by its pointlessness
you didnt read the article then
each to his own whenever i come across the word rabid i expect it to be followed by the word dog meaning a male animal this could be because although i am british i live in southeast asia where the dread disease is prevalent the word dog is also of course a derogatory term for a certain type of women as is the word bitch which for some strange reason seems never to follow the the adjective rabid mr shariatmadari assumes the term rabid feminist is sexist despite the fact that many feminists myself included happen to be men watch your language sir
i like being able to tell the difference between things helps me no end
most of these pejorations seem to begin during the early modern period when society shifted out of feudal relationships not sure what to make of it except that with the development of a market economy those with economic power increasingly defined language to their own advantage
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a husband
feminism sexism that doesnt recognise that being demeaning to another applies to both genders and is thus unable to exist in isolation from men
statistically speaking women are more likely to physically abuse children a fact feminists dont like to mention
you could used more chaucer words
hey i resent the diss on my music snorkel tm 
you mean the changes came through women being bitchy to one another quite possible sorry if ive misunderstood young women round my way talk of getting tarted up to go out just a way of gently poking fun at themselves i dont see the word tart as sexist per se its just how some people use it
again this is an article about the history of the language why is everyone missing that
but youre missing my point if you get into a london cab it is still quite likely that you will be asked where to guvnor what has this to do with running a large facility the process happens to all sort of words some of them are feminine it is not sexism it is more like natural selection
yes languages do need negative words to function and usage will often reflect the print and broadcast media there are probably more pejorative words for the male gender than female douche douchebag scumbag pussy wus choad tool bent wanker dick dick head prick asshole shithead yob lout nancy sissy bellendetc etc and since feminist can apply to both male and female havent many of you all fallen into the pc trap
really are you acquainted with the urban dictionary im waiting to be enlightened
rabid fan do you genuinely think that is a collocation quasi illiterate journalist is far more common
no youve read an article about the history of the language history being ya know the past
im so sorry if i offended you ill go and put my head down a personhole
white wedding white knight white lie the white days of his life white russian thats mighty white of you white elephant white flag white house white mans burden white tie beats black tie whitewash snow white 
what the man does not understand is that language evolvesof course he understands that this article is about the history of terms that refer to women shows how deep negative attitudes go emphasis mine hes illustrating how historical bad treatment of women can be seen in the historical legacy of our language whats so hard to understand
some of my favourite people are tarts and trollops
sadly esperanto has its own problems there is a specific feminine ending to indicate female nouns it is possible to use genderneutral words but its a late departure from the original plan
constructing an irrelevant false dichotomy is a fallacious riposte to this article
and im sure there are negatively connatated words associated with men
what a load of nonsense
i like that
is not your queen addressed as maam a contraction of madam
haha mine was leftie ive clearly spent too much time on here xd
chav
he could be accused of being a prick or indeed a knob bellend maybe then we have philanderer bounderwimp scoundrel rascal loverat fop goat pig and dog
clearly the parphrase is his own take on the incident rather than simply their neutral explanation
its a wee bit easier to discern the intent of the perpetrator if you catch them in the act of doing nasty things to a child isnt it equally easy to discern the intent of a racist who does nasty things to a coloured person or of a sexist who goes on to abuse women of course its a matter of interpretation thats why youre just seeing things isnt the right answer
the article was not a comparative study of language but since you ask the same trends can be seen in french wherein maitresse has undergone the same denigration as mistress in english and even fille girl has come to mean prostitute and needs to be qualified as jeune fille young girl or samatanotrevotre fille hishermyyourour daughter to be unambiguous not much of this in spanish though
whats pejorative about governess society included such a function it needed a wordyou really dont see why it might be considered sexist that a male governor by the definition of the word is presumed to controlrun a large areafacility eg a prison or us state while a female governess is presumed by the definition of the word to take care of a kid or two the power prestige and respect of the same word are changed massively by whether its applied to a male vs female thats the definition of sexism inferiority being presumed because of the female gender i must again stress ive very little time for feminism in general finding most of it to be whinging pc nonsense but this is a well written article with a very clear and well illustrated point
following this logic the words woman girl lass female also fall into the sexism pot
bitch has stated to be applied to males also grating and shrill i would take to apply to non human noises eg alarms and nagging would refer to a feeling that will not quite go away eg doubt still you can see the sexism in anything if you look hard enough for it
you wrote rabidmy instant conflation was tory it didnt spark a genderist reaction at all
i was taught that shrew is the female equivalente of shrewd therefore not insulting
bring me another pint of your foaming ale wench as opposed to a pint of carling darling if were to moan about such things at least lets make them reasonably current
why arent there as many names for evil men who inflict ego abuse and cruelty on kids and women theyre just called men
man up will you
so if a newspaper headline says some male celebrity pictured with mistress you expect to see a photograph of the man and his boss youre clearly happy jumping through hoops thats fine its even sadder that people defend this
then again some french occupations have established feminine forms avocat avocate and boulanger boulangère for exemple while others dont i think in france the argument is as much a grammatical one as one based on ideas of what might or might not be sexist it seems odd to apply a masculine job noun to a woman doing the job
fewest even
eight words the heart of the english language by this we have to presume that you have gone and compare this language with many others and have then concluded that this was unique to the english language
schlampei wonder what the root of that word is i dont speak german just came across the word cause i watch a lot of german porn 
comment of the day
the article points out that in a number of these cases the original uses of the words werent sexist and were merely technicalities of the manner you mention it was the way their usage developed and changed that later made them sexist and if you dont think language matters well thats your opinion but i think you underestimate the power of words
yaaaaaaaaaaaawnnnnzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz
there are plenty of words that are neutral or positive that relate to women woman girl paragon lady female sweetheart is still there even if it spawned tart i suspect that women are often the first to cast negative aspersions on members of their sex and if there is a surfeit of derogatory words for women many of them have been twisted in that direction by judgemental or jealous females
i must have missed that part where is the entire english language denounced as sexist rather than a selection of words
no there is a basic claim that the english language is sexist the crap clickbait headline not written by the author may suggest that but the author specifically argues otherwise in the actual article in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world
loves cock
and bachelor has its own connotations as a codeword for gay thats confirmed bachelor usually i heard many years ago in a radio  programme about obituary pages that the times at least i think it was the times but it might have been one of the other british broadsheets had the confirmed bachelor thing as a codeword for gay actually written down in the special confidential style guide for the obituaries page if someone gay died one had to write mr smith a confirmed bachelor  if mr smith was known or though to be straight but had never married one had to write mr smith who never married  things like frequently tired and emotional for alcoholic were in there too how they described gay men who had married women not an uncommon occurrence in those days and thus werent confirmed bachelors i dont know anyway the article atl is a bit of silly lazy nonsense i cant even tell whether its meant humourously or seriously
i think its the likes of jessica valenti who are doing the associating of feminism with rabid
s they were posh gits
the sexism at the heart of a language reflects the sexism at the heart of the evolution of the human species for example the fact that it is more adaptive for a woman to play hard to get than for a man the fact that promiscuity is more adaptive for a man than for a woman etc
male prostitutes that provide for women really arent that common on the other hand female prostitutes that provide for mens needs are very common it is hardly surprising then that words that apply to women get used more often as slang words for prostitute similarly words for people that use prostitutes are more male orientated is it sexist that their is no market for male to female prostitutes or that there is a massive market of female to male prostitutes maybe or maybe they just reflect genuine differences what about governor and governess both really just mean to govern in history people that governed cites or countries were principally men people that governed young children and young ladies were women hence the different meanings sexist i guess so governors tended to be military hence men who equally couldnt be trusted to look after the honour of a young lady more an indication of the way we lived than the way we live
one blogger below made the real point here  does the word generate a life and world of its own the author is saying it does and i agree with that using sexist definitions to define a word helps make that word actually become sexist and fix it as a sexist word in the language conversely ensuring that nonsexist examples are used for words like rabid or grating will literally help to prevent that word becoming associating negatively with women for my part i cannot ever think of the tiny animal the shrew without thinking of shakespeares take on women as shrews associations are very powerful
id rather be a legend than a myth
drudgery drudge sounds sexist to me

a black lady in south carolina upbraided me for not calling her maam i explained that the english do not use this for anyone but the queen she was quite happy about this
like the hand wringers who deemed blackboard to be racist you couldnt make it up
gay possibly but i dont think it was ever exclusively masculine
hang on to your paper books the thought police will be rewriting the electronic dictionaries soon so gratifying that there are no more serious problems in their world
so next week a column explaining that the expression talking bollocks is disrespectful to men well be spoiled for choice when it comes to examples
imaginary really really i dont think so delusional perhaps
 oaf cad lout bastard womanizer geek nerd clodfanboy
nope i didnt suggest that and never would its just the comment implied that she took umbrage and depending on how strong that umbrage was it might have created the opportunity to ask

guardian guardian governess duenna mistress nannytutoress
wow i thought i had read some moronic articles in the guardian but to accuse a whole language of being sexist is a different level take a bow
you have hit the nail on the head you make exactly the point the author makes or does the word generate a life and world of its own he is saying it does and i agree with that using sexist definitions to define a word helps make that word become sexist and fix it as a sexist word
lol
i had a teacher who said that words like manager and manhole were sexist because they contained the syllable man seriously
strewth a few of these are job descriptions
feminists could easily avoid the inherent sexism of the english language by speaking only esperanto this would have several other benefits too allowing them to communicate more easily with feminists of other nationalities and allowing the rest of us a break from their increasingly ridiculous complaints being only two
assault and battery an assault is criminal to batter is a verb that has largely fallen out of use except in the case of weather events cornwall was battered by storm jonas or waves battered the shoreline the weather is neutral natural it is a force of nature and cannot be hauled into court for its actions so why do we refer to battered women rather than assaulted women because it is natural rather than criminal to thump the wife sexism runs deep in our language
could also have mentioned harlot
i guess on the plus side it wouldnt result in the all these idiotic kneejerk comments that seem to be along the lines of har har bloody guardian  lefty theyre going to abolish my words true thered be far fewer reactionary responses proudly defending their right to speak their own language although there might be some posts along the lines of har har no wonder all zulu speakers r idiotz
the people turning a blind eye to the real rape and abuse going on in the uk eg rotherham were the police the council social services etc of these the worst was the police some policemen have even been found guilty of raping suspects not in the rotherham cases and been discharged from the force there was an article on saturday of a woman reporting a young man who she thought was grooming her son online i looked into the background in an minute phone call she gave the police his name and the county he was in he was already on their computer for attempted rape of a teen boy a year or so earlier httpwwwtheguardiancomuknewsnovpoliceurgedreviewhandlingchildgroomingcasesbreckbednar the police didnt bother to follow it up her son ended up being murdered by that sicko who is thankfully now behind bars on a life sentence its not feminists turning a blind eye to rape you are so so wrong
neither has courtesan lost its meaning to refer to courtesans or mistress to refer to some woman having dozens of servants in those examples the same or similar person is being referred to in a different context as the meaning changed if you want to apply the same logic to changes of meaning of boy then you have to find instances of it being applied in a derogatory way to a juvenile otherwise an analogy is being used to belittle an adult which is not the same thing as the word changing meaning or acquiring an additional meaning
only a fool would consider that a thing of the past yes fool has a male pronoun as an example google fool the example is all there to seehere and there
i find a strange mixture in new york there is a general politeness of people holding doors saying please and thank you and addressing the person whose name one doesnt know as sir or maam not madame but there is some sort of ageism too i appreciate the politeness of someone addressing me a greybeard as sir versus dude which ive also had but i know that for women in particular being addressed as maam is perceived as being of a certain age which age who knows i just call everyone sir or maam im a londoner but londons love or mate i perceive as disrespectful
but those are all terms that have always or for a long time at least had negative connotations the article is about the ways that the meanings of certain words have evolved and taken on negative connotations
i think the difference is you seem to think im jumping through hoops im not first definitions after a google searchmistress a woman in a position of authority or controlmaster a man who has people working for him especially servants or slaveswhich one is positive
i dont know why i was only thinking about the written form sorry that was utterly idiotic of me changing the pronouns wouldnt work in mandarin verbally at all since both he and she have the exact same sound still i find it a bit odd to say female businessman out loud in mandarin though that might be down to regional difference in the colloquial terms we are each used to
ok now lets start comparing the english language to pali sanskrit urdu and hindi and then lets see which one has the least sexist words seeing as its open season on sexist language its only fair other languages should come under the same level of scrutiny
lad once an innocuous reference to a younger man now used to talk about a potential rapist lad is a good example of a word that may be on the slide laddish behaviour but i dont think that is has go that far yet was macho ever an established part of the english language i think its a recent late th century import from spanish via american english it may have briefly been used seriously but quickly became ironic
a teacher i know foolishly asked a female pupil to describe a female teacher whose name she didnt know the common looking one came the reply telling off the child she then had to stop herself easily identifying the said teacher
arabic anyone
women tend not to be very impressed with men who are like women maybe its womens fault ever thought of that
or a woman to be called manly by your reasoning it is because being like a man is an insult
wouldnt it be far better if the recipient took your politeness in the manner it was intended and politely overcome their own myopic view of the world
whenever i hear the words bastard cad cuckhold and poofter i am reminded of the matricarchal oppression inherent in the english language and need to retreat to my safespace
the comments are fascinating too some real headinthesand stuff im dismissive of about  of feminism gender complains and identity politics finding most of it to just be baseless overly pc whinging but this article is very real concrete and blatant not sure how folks are dismissing it so easily
i remember a teacher talking about the sexism laced in feminine pronouns when i was about  did david just move house and find some old school books what a bunch of 
effeminate certainly demonstrates the way in which being like a woman is seen as demeaning but its not in this list because this is about words whose meaning has shifted from a word with a simple male equivalent to a denigration while the male equivalent has retained its original meaning
good thinking ill edit my guardian soulmates wish list accordingly
its the same in french or german or even spanish should we rewrite and regulate the language no language is natural it is what it is i hate these pretentious observances of the language non article
cock knocker shitbag smurger fuck knuckle
im not sure why youre jumping through hoops trying to justify this but please stop its embarrassing master meaning a strong confident leader or a peak of skill while mistress means a home wrecking whore is clearly as skewed as its possible to be the male form is wholly positive the female form wholly negative
i said all the words shown above and below the line are chosen by the user i mean the examples cited by the author and the commentators after in english
should we all switch to russian now
as a male i think id prefer a womans hands on me anyway what about you
i asked who you were talking to because surely being a man it cant be the author who needs to put his victim card away
its not businessman but businessperson thus female businessperson 女商人
why is english less sexist or german more sexist in france for example a lot of women insist upon creating feminine forms for occupations and jobsfor example une écrivaine une professeurein gbusa the idea is to eradicate gender difference whereas in france a lot of women insist upon the difference
no there is a basic claim that the english language is sexist i have argues that it is not the language itself that is sexist but the way that people use certain words that specifically are sexist a difference between macro use and micro use if you like english in itself is not sexist it is militaristic you can decide which is worse to show a language that is really sexist i used spanish because the words are embedded with double meanings that both men and women have no choice but to use all the words shown above and below the line are chosen by the user it is not the language that is sexist but the person who chooses to use them if i say in spanish where are our wives i am obliged to make a sexist comment where are our handcuffs therefore the language itself in a macro sense is sexist
fascinating article the perjoration stigmatizes the intended target of the term based on sexuality only a fool would consider that a thing of the past
all of the words in the article are old fashioned though interestingly the only modern examples of anything close i can think of that could be applied to men are ones invented by online feminists to denigrate masculinity and these seem to involve taking neutral or positive words and sticking them together to create a reduction by caricature neckbeard dudebro mansplainer etc
how is effeminate not on this list it is literally an insult to be told youre like a woman
which is all wrong isnt it as we all start off as a xx until we are ruined with maleness and turned into a sort of half made up mutant to paraphrase richard iii a thing at which the dogs do bark all irritable and wrong and moany i know i am women live longer and are just better generally men are quite good at hammering in tent pegs so yes genetically woman should be the root word and man an offshoot
one of the wonderful things about words is they have life they have spice and energy and that comes from the way we use them they also have ambiguity which means that you can use a word with a particular meaning in such a way that it undercuts and ridicules the original meaning sometimes using words in this word is called irony and the problem with irony is that you need intelligence to understand that a word can have different meanings some of which are opposed to each other
pop gt tart the power of advertising strikes again
dude you are really reaching how about some actual investigative reporting as opposed to instagative reporting
how about cowboy in the states its apparently a compliment
maybe you should have asked the female clerk if there was an equivalent she found acceptable yes all interactions must henceforth include a preliminary formalised negotiation sequence in which words of respect and personal linguistic tastes can be established that ought to make human communication so much easier and more spontaneous
being complacently indenial is the new morality
actually when you say pop i think tart this language is sexist
what
knave and cad youve missed out churlmind you in south manchester that is a denizen of chorlton
no because that would be silly and only someone trying to belittle them would even suggest it
where did i say the author wasnt a man
wench is still used albeit affectionately in the black country its not uncommon to hear people refer to their wife as my wench but like i say its affectionate rather than sexist nobody gets offended by it that i know of at least anecdotal evidence i know but i thought it might be of interest
prince kate catherine duke of cambridge etc etc
i think yours is a perfect example of the asymmetrical sexism of the language one could call a woman a dick by which we might mean that shes a jerkobnoxious or perhaps were referring to her profession as a private investigator but no matter how much a man worked at spinning yarn youd call him a spinner before youd call him a spinster
you do know that a number of those words are derived from the french which has genders and many jobs or descriptors are masculin or feminine depending on the person they refer to right can we stop making banal things out to be sexist and tackle some actual problems related to sexism that genuinely matter
the author is a man so who are you talking to
have you ever been called a hussy or tart or wench youve just discovered a new problem that has never effected your life but now you feel sad for having read about it welcome to 
maybe you should have asked the female clerk if there was an equivalent she found acceptable it is an interesting one because love and mate in london are largely ok for strangers but love can offend some i tend to be warier of using it for younger women as a result as it can seem condescending if they arent used to it
 i find the momentum insults vastly amusing as momentum was founded to laud corbyn but corbyn called for a kinder gentler politics its almost as if the insulters didnt know what they believed in 
this may be where ive been going wrong asking if they knew where i could purchase some exotic cheroots
if youre stuck for an insult why not fall back on the tried and tested wanker compared to some its fairly innocuous and as gyles brandreth discovered its considered fair comment if used in print or public as an aside its also used as a generally affectionate term in guitar forums for those who indulge in a bit of over the top fretboard gymnastics
i think the modern obsession with words and offence is probably because were overwhelmed by words  hour news social media comments on newspaper articles etc weve all got opinions coming at us from all directions indeed opinion has become a widely accepted substitute for action share this facebook post if you disagree send your thoughts and prayers to victims of a crime politicians expressing regret etc we live in a culture which has way too much noise and making some noise of your own seems to many people to be the only response
spliffj or joint the other terms are reserved for middle class people trying to seem down with the kids
you cant tell the difference between a joke and reality so perhaps its your comment that sums it up best
words are important which why in your first sentence you should have said identity with not identify as unless you have multiple personalitiesbrilliant matthew parris the guy who lived on benefits for a week didnt get any bills in that time pay rent or have to actually buy anything and somehow concluded that the unemployed had more than enough money perhaps the word brilliant has different meanings in your world i would have gone with twat
i look at the new language of the corbyn crew melts slugs gammon and see a discourse of contempt there are connotations of contempt in the word crew too a gang a cabal some gangsters a group of thieves brought together to do a job madonnas ray of light is extremely good her deeper voice was a stronger voice something i think which came out of her voice training for the brilliant film evita a year or so before she couldve built a kind of scorsesede niro relationship with william orbit and done a number of great works but they fell out i gather words do matter but so does a sense of humour and not shouting at someone because theyve perhaps slipped up and made an incorrect choice agreed on the comatoseness of remain but i knew thered be trouble when the snappy compound of brexit was agreed upon to be used by both sides the rightwing always frames everything everything and what passes for an opposition never realises until its too late being too busy talking about minutiae while the money are is being lifted and the safe is being blown open
label and victims
the modern obsession with words and offense is precisely because if we started judging the chattering classes on actions theyd be found wanting the culture of offense is really just a more sophisticated form of apathy
when referring to somone as gay the other day she yelled that i was biphobic it all ended badly with me informing her that the difference between a straight man and a gay man was half a lager i shouldnt have said that i should have said craft beer sums up the level of problems this country has at the moment
still it was galling to say the least to see the brilliant matthew parris tell women to stop being victims and a little rich given it shortly followed an interview on the today programme in which he said there was too much focus on womens victims and it was starting to make decent men feel bad notallmen
i think lgbtqipo is too long to get on a badge and i dont see what omnisexual can bring to the party that the other initials cant fair enough although no one uses this as an acronym anyway i imagine theres a happy medium to be found on language generally not every term that is new or different is an affront not everyone who uses the perceived wrong term deserves opprobrium i dont think its a hardship to refer to others how they prefer to be referred to and nor is it the end of the world if someone makes a mistake
yes do ask a teenager because the wisdom of distilled experience in the words of a wise old fellow are worth about nuffink
i asked a teenager reefers or jazz cigarettes are now called zoots or blunts innit bruv
reality hitting home hard then
i used to be with it but then they changed what it was now what im with isnt it anymore and whats it seems weird and scary itll happen to you
words pale in comparison to actions in this age of being offended by everything we should b taking words less and less and judge people by the things they do not say as one thing is usually the polar opposite of the other meaning most people are hypocrites riding high horses
its such a tired tactic of the right who fear change of any kind to accuse those who question the status quo of political correctness
language doesnt just reflect thought it does actually shape thought as well if for example you insist on gender neutral language that does over time play a part in changing the way people think removing a major reinforcement of gender prejudices
clearly this goes far beyond tweeting the zealots on the left have a lot of influence on universities they are the anti intellectual creeps who are getting secularist speakers banned from universities on the basis of safe space doctrine
which dictionary was this i just looked up shrill in the shorter oxford the volume version and this definition simply is not there further the usage examples are for boys and girls the colour of the impressionists the wind the night his shrill rage your voice a source which i tracked down and which is addressed to one man by another hm
in a way yes the goal of course is to create an environment amenable to scientific research amp scientific progress one wherein researchers in fields that rely on scientific approaches amp methodologies be they climatologists be they lexicographers or be they any other such researchers might conduct their research freely amp be under no compulsion to make the results of their research conform to this or that subjective standard thrown at them by overbearing ideological cranks amp modern day lysenkoists be they climate denialists be they radical feminists or be they anyone else so if this be the charge which is to be laid before me then all i can say is guilty as charged my lord
i think the use of nagging to describe pain is used in advertisments for pain relief medications more than in day to day conversation commercial television watched during childhood has probably etched it deeply into my brain and that that of many others here
i think your definition fits the mainstream media better than it does twitter
well i think you are trying to create a safe space for yourself too only your safe space is one which is free of identification of sexism what threat does identifying and discussing sexism pose to you
also good points and ones that support rather than contradict the examples brought up in the article
so all it takes to ban or restrict language is tweeting a suggestion at a massive authoritative entity thats basically immune to bad press because you know they make the gd dictionary good to know
without white men there would be no progress towards equality there is no progressive country on earth that is not controlled by white men im not saying that it naturally has to be this way but i do think that white men deserve to hear a thank you now and then to keep their spirits up
this is typical of the cultural cleansing zeal of people on the left they always approach problems from the wrong end rather than truly change attitudes through discussion and argument they try to ban or restrict the use of language the fallacy of political correctness is that if a word or phrase cannot be spoken or written the thought behind it disappears surely experience shows that it just doesnt work people experience the suffocating pressure of political correctness but the regressive attitudes remain in their minds a dictionary should serve to reflect the actual contemporary usage of words dictionaries become valuable to historians as a means of tracking the evolution of the english language
molest assault or abuse a person especially a woman or child sexuallyhe was charged with molesting and taking obscene photographs of a tenyearold boy rapethe crime typically committed by a man of forcing another person to have sexual intercourse with the offender against theirwillhe denied two charges of attemptedrapehe had committed at least two rapes perverthector is a man who is simply perverted by his timenice how they helpfully let you know hectors gender isnt it abusehe was a depraved man who had abused his two young daughters
theyre in the article so probably easier for you to reread than for me to type them out incidentally theyre also instantly recognisable to anyone whos ever said anything feminist on the internet at the risk of getting flamed and because ive often liked your nonfeminismrelated comments i can promise you the irritation not outrage crying or any other subtly gendered characterisation is real its a sense of oh ffs not them as well as every moronic channer and daily mail wag we dont need them contributing to the background hum of hostility to women and womens voices in particular
only thats a different meaning of rabid the whole point of using rabid feminist is that its the symbolic meaning of language rather than medical rabid neonazi or rabid antifascist is equivalent usage to rabid feminist not rabid animal
there are over  million words in the english language  examples is still one in a million social scientists are renowned for cherry picking their data especially the ones with an ideology to push on either end of the political spectrum if he can provide examples of all four options women used negatively women used positively men used negatively and men used positively by taking a random sample of at least  words and show that there is a significant degree of difference in distribution of male and female examples in that sample and if others using the same methodology can replicate the findings then i will concede the point right now hes arguing institutional sexism on a biased sample that isnt big enough to prove anything real scientists seek to disprove their hypotheses not justify them with anecdotal evidence
i think you are confusing the equivalence of your subjective feeling to the actual experience of someone raised in a culture of censorship i think casaleiro may have a clearer practical understanding of censorship than you or i with only a hypothetical understanding i therefore lend his opinion greater weight than either of ours censorship always starts innocently enough but by a million little cuts it redefines what free speech is with every step by the time you realise something centralnto our freedom is being censored its too late censorship creeps up on you
the definition of rape given not the example sentence by oxford specifically indicates its done by men i would consider this a much more blatant example of sexism since its not just a sample sentence apparently omanreagan doesnt agree though when i tweeted it to him rather than respond he simply blocked me
if subjectivity is no worse than objectivity i feel like im a medical doctor would you like me to perform surgery on your child
twitter should be banned
oh i hope youll accept my apology
im with the urban dictionary definition on this one
crybully is good i will have occasional to use it in the university full of selfrighteous young things where i am currently decaying
thanks for the long and interesting post i would be very happy to make a career as a lexicographer im involved as occasional research assistant on a project in a university in which my work is essentially lexicographical and it is seductive work
look to be offended and you will be report your offended reaction in the newspapers and launch a media career worked for proudman presumably omarreagans looking for the same
okay if you think everyone who doesnt see exactly eye to eye with you has a closed mind then you yourself are not very open minded up until then i was enjoying our debate
because so many men have fought for womens rights historically right
phew 
as other commenters have noted this is not the oed with a long list of etymology and citation but odo a simplified dictionary aimed largely at english language learners it was the single collocation cited in that context appropriacy in the selection is a consideration or at least further usage notes should be provided take the point that the storm over this is a bit overblown though
rabid right  hits
rabid fan  hits so its dogs fans and feminists that lead so far
i am british born and raised and a freelance editor and i dont i consider it the premier uk english dictionary if im editing us english my goto dictionary would be merriamwebster there is no premier english dictionary since english can refer to a great many different forms of the language oxford is not useful if youre writing or editing american english and even canadian english has its own oxford which differs from the uk version
i see well carry on then
nope its non specific sarcasm
and god the example of beautiful a beautiful young woman sexist scum
 and if the teacup fits storm in it
now why would you assume that a rabid feminist was a woman
hmm this guy seems to have conveniently missed the sexism embedded in the definition of sexism itself prejudice stereotyping or discrimination typically against women on the basis of sex
if the shoe fits 
theres no need to compound your error with peevishness 
is this some of that feminist humour ive heard so much about it completely matches my expectations well done
i am taking the mickey
unfortunately some commenters seem to be assuming that the choice of which collocations are presented in the examples is made purely on statistical evidence and that reviewing and sometimes changing the examples would be some sort of unwarranted interference with the lexicographers work
hahaha such projection you types are hilarious
outrageous what was wrong with toxic
interestingly if you put nagging pain into the graph it is much more frequent in recent times than either nagging man or nagging woman i thought referring to womens voices as shrill was reasonable as they are on average higher pitched than mens
this does genuinely seem to make you angry perhaps you should do some mindfulness going through life so angry is bad for you
the problem is the micromanagement trying to sanitize every little opposition to your worldview that is the problem not the definition but you types need to be countered any time you dont make sense because maybe it will make some of you see reason low success rates but still worth it sometimes already answered that oh so clever observation of yours it wasnt any harder to answer the second time
it is an issue you are not in charge of grading issues as important or not thats the point you seem to be spending a lot of time here on the issue considering how unimportant you consider it to be
more importantly were the rabid feminists beach body ready
ah nice bit of social engineering youre proposing good luck with that
i know it was a play on words i just clarified that that would not be a good alternative to the offending sentence as might have also been the insinuation i accept that this might not have been your intent but as that could have been taken away i pointed out different definition
have you entered some sort of warped mental state where the only social demographic allowed is humans anyone with an inkling of social skills would realize i was referring to the latest trend of complaining about everything regardless of whether its an issue or not you know that though and are just doing the usual deflection technique pretty standard but fortunately doesnt actually contribute anything to the discussion
its unfortunate some people are too stupid to recognise a play on words and then insist in parading their ignorance we just have to live with the consequences
gosh you are a long way up your own posterior you types hilarious humans you mean
i suggested she look at the womens equality party as its factual rather than polemical she was rude to me in response so i was rude back to her not really sure what point you are making but anyone including a sarcastic how dare she is also being polemical and bitching about others alleged polemic at the same time
sorry relevant well done you
spelling mistake sorry
the word is rabid but i dont want to be pedantici am not complaining about this im simply pointing out the absurdity of searching a dictionary for evidence of sexist oppression while at the same time ignoring all evidence to the contrary but i dont mind i think ill start minding when usain bolt is forced to run with rocks in his pockets so that he doesnt perpetuate the stereotype of male athletes being faster than their female counterparts
i just googled the phrases rabid dog  hits rabid feminist  hits rabid republican  and rabid socialist  rabid sexist on the other hand gave only  hits its clear from this that dogs should figure in the primary definition and examples though usage obviously dictates that feminists and republicans are so often described as rabid that they should be in there too
omanreagan is a from the usa hes studying in canada so he is it takes just a quick bit of googling to discover that its just that i was apparently foolish enough to take the line canadian anthropologist michael omanreagan as meaning that the anthropologist michael omanreagan was canadian how stupid of me
i love the way you proudly display your ignorance definition does not mean what the origin meant if you look at the dictionary you will see that there are two definitions and that nagging toothache fits into the second whilst nagging wife is the example sentence for the first definition httpwwwoxforddictionariescomdefinitionenglishnagging
factsaregood vslvsl h ago   different definition entirely i love the way youre proud to display your ignorance the words scandinavian in origin the root being to gnaw
your views are cool if you have a twitter account mine is stayfreeinside
i thought that too before i read the story but the guy has a point
exactly fortunately for us sexism and prejudice doesnt actually exist in that respect i also find it quite creepy that youd only complain about this because the feminists made a complaint about the example used for rapid and therefore undermining the argument made by the oppressed from your im assuming youre a man position of privilege
i see your point but im not sure i agree i suspect there are a lot of factors that go into choosing usage examples and a lot of possible valid choices for each word so avoiding the ones that perpetuate stereotypes wouldnt mean using less appropriate ones just different ones this all strikes me as innuendo amp whataboutery repeatedly asking in an accusatory manner why did you pick this example why didnt you pick another example ad nauseum with out actually bothering to investigate or otherwise find flaws in the methodologies themselves as i said in another place all these attack strategies employed by the od accusers such as cherry picking several examples out of thousands in the hope that such may serve as smoking guns using such as a basis of attacking the judgement amp professionalism of the lexicographers arguing that the lexicographers have been nobbled by this or that institutional pressure or special interest playing up amp exaggerating the subjectivity of lexicography this all strikes me as being very similar to the methods routinely employed by the socalled climate change denialists amp various other cranks online and the goal seems to be the same to brow beat them to change their methodology not on account of any flaw found in the methodology itself but rather because the results dont accord to some ideological world view id hope it would be possible to paint a true picture of the language without perpetuating and therefore validating to some extent the prejudicial connotations some words and phrases have but its definitely a complex issue with a lot of things to be weighed against each other its not one cannot reasonably expect amp demand that what are essentially subjective and often times conflicting standards such as that of offensiveness be applied to the results published by those in a field which relies primarily upon scientific methodologies in the preparation of said results it wont work in modern lexicography any better than it would in climatology one would just end up with ever increasingly subjective amp prescriptive dictionaries in place of the current dictionaries which for the most part are objective amp descriptive also the thought that ideas are selfvalidating that is to say they are validated to an extent every time they are uttered is wrongheaded it is an attempt to lay an intellectual foundation for the suppression of certain unwelcome ideas on the unreasonable proposition that their mere utterance represents a threat it is hardly surprising that those who buy into such pseudointellectual claptrap would not be able to distinguish between that which is intended as a descriptive example of usage amp that which is intended as an assertion of fact it does bring up a lot of interesting questions and possibilities theres the option of using rabid feminists but flagging it as offensive for instance that would solve the issue youre talking about in your second paragraph about connotations or even use both examples and point out that one is more offensive than the other because dictionaries have gone mostly online now theres no need to limit the usage examples as much as they have historically this might work provided that the word considered by amp a qualifier be added to indicate that this is a subjective amp not an objective judgement also methodologies would have to be devised to find a reasonably objective means of selecting the qualifier id est shall it be considered offensive by some or considered offensive by many regional distinctions would have to be taken into account as well for example in the case of certain usages of the adjective oriental which is considered offensive by many in the us but not in other regions so it could be done provided that appropriate methods amp standards be used for making such additions amp provided that od stick to these methods amp not go about slapping them onto words amp examples willynilly or otherwise ginning up their methodology with a certain result in mind as twitterstorms amp other forms of social media based outrage come amp go
when you give sweeping statements like this could you back it up with some statistics probably not because derogatory generalisations seem to be the way to go to tarbrush a huge movement that encompasses very different people
so the examples given onrabid are an indication of the inherent sexist attitude that seeps into every aspect of our society while the examples given on deranged are just random nothing to see here move along
ah well i tried keep your mind closed and have a happy life its safer that way
yes that is filed under leisure its a very entertaining hobby but we dont make a big deal out of it let alone a career
heh heh have a look in wiki apparently tournament scrabble is governed by a word list called sowpods which in the uk is based on collins scrabble words but if you dont have one of those to hand lets say youve gone camping im sure you can agree to play by any dictionary or none so long as you dont come to blows 
i the crucial fact that they are genuine usage and not made up is only presented in oups response towards the end as though it was simply a claim they made instead of established fact as far as i can see the author nowhere acknowledges it as fact instead sandwiching it between mr omanregans complaints and further material that can be taken as an admission of guilt ii who tweeted what to whom is not relevant it is the author of the article who chose to speak misleadingly of the example sentences etc and give a completely unrepresentative selection without acknowledging this fact
i pretty much agree with your second point except id turn it around and say current usage reflects the immediate past more than the distant past however a lexicographer will want to see a neologism or a change of use become established ie persist for some time before recording it in a dictionary so the dictionary can record neither current use nor recent changes
how will a scrabble game get finished
if they are sexist why shouldnt they be corrected
it is but we have to give the sexists something to throw at us that wont be modded its only fair
do they define rabid differently btw although i am not british i still consider the oed the premier english dictionary
im sure you can give us a positive example of rabid then deidrah
ive had that argument with my husband many a time apparently i nag but he points out funny how men never nag isnt it
because society is now equal under all laws and so any issues relating to women going into politics belong to the women themselves true discrimination should be fought but i dont see that anywhere i just see people getting worked up over nothing again and again and again and massively discrediting themselves
i am struggling to understand how affected by rabies can have anything other than negative connotations it is the negativity in the literal meaning that gives rise to the negativity of the extended meaning
sorry i dont mean to be i would just like you to finish your sentence
im finding you quite threatening
while one could argue that this is merely reflective of the sexism of the society as a whole i think that would be disingenuous in this day and age an accurate reflection of language usage would be less sexist than a generation ago frankly the examples included in the article feel about a generation out of date to me feel feel feel this all seems to be about feel try not to be so parochial in your outlook english dictionaries especially the oxford branded ones get their sources from english speaking societies around the world so unless youve spent decades touring the world amp getting a feel for how it is used in all these various amp diverse societies your feelings hardly form a basis for such sweeping statements on the other hand i dont care enough about the issue to do an exhaustive study of the dictionary in question and catalog all the supporting and conflicting examples then drop it amp stop trying to present your feelings as the basis of a reasoned opinion lexicography is quite scientific amp methodology driven this day in age amp as such feeling is not in amp of itself a ground to challenge the results of methodology one must find evidence of flaws in the methodology cherry picking results just wont suffice in the end i suspect that theyll change it not on account of any errors on their part but just to make the rapid ideologues who a congregating around this matter shut up amp go away its just not worth it its a small matter but it does make for a sad story as to how far we have fallen to passion amp rejection of reason in the face of the mob since the onset of the twitter age
well if you regard minutes ago as the past all is either past or future but the immediate past reflects current usage more than the distant past
sorry comment continues of various climate scientists this is the crux of my disagreement with you you cannot know this anymore than i can know that they are all frustrated misongynists deliberately trying to belittle women though their authoritative explanations of language yes that was an attempt at humor i hope it is not lost on you again this is something of a climate change denialist gambit you call their character expertise amp impartiality into question without providing any evidence to back it up other than cherrypicked smokingguns amp when pressed you try to shift the burden of proof by arguing at least implicitly that the accused must prove that the accusation is false that they most show that they arent what you amp the twitterati say they could well be your arguments here all fall well within the modus operandi of climate change denialists amp for much the same reason you like the denialists are challenging the results of your opponents not on the basis of any detected flaws in their methodologies but rather because their results dont conform to certain ideologically imposed requirements
you are creating an impossible standard of course there is no firm objective evidence unless you were to work there you would not know and even if you did work there you still would probably not know because who can map out the prejudices of everyone within an organisation not impossible it would require a rigourous review of the dictionary itself and the entries therein and not just cherry picking a few suspect examples out of thousands as well as the methodology itself this is probably not going to be easy for the oppiniated people online but is nevertheless necessary what you and certain others are attempting to do is akin to what the online climate change denialists habitually do they dig around the publically available data online looking for smoking guns amp use bits amp pieces that may look suspicious on their own to question the impartiality amp intellectual honesty of clim
the dictionary is offensive now that said we are now reviewing the example sentence for rabid to ensure that it reflects current usage think you nailed it the first time
yes but the point i think himandhim was making is that british english is only one form of english and for example merriamwebster the canadian oxford the american heritage dictionaries etc might all take issue that the oxford is the worlds premier dictionary of english
even using a word like derogatory gives a bias and the rabid is often used without bias eg rabid feminist meaning simply a person who is intensely feminist in some contexts this would actually be a good thing and therefore if used in that context it would be in no way derogatory as to affection have you never used or heard used a normally abusive term applied without the abuse for example you might call a close friend a lucky bastard or a silly old fart without being insulting likewise rabid for anyone whose is excessive it is the tone of voice and context that determine when a word is abusive and when it is affectionate thats how it works in english anyway i cannot speak for other languages and other cultures
indeed but in this instance the e has an historical function a words former uses never change and they must be retained in a good dictionary to allow readers of older material to get at the appropriate meaning in context this is one of the real benefits of the oed and what sets it above other dictionaries in the language in due course it will also include the pc examples the average dictionary like some of the more recent oxford products do not even include some words that appear in texts of the earlier th century even the newest edition of chambers is deficient in a few areas and i am not even considering their removal of some delightfully whimsical definitions not useful therefore and i am glad i have my own set of the complete oed
i see that hypersensitivity to other peoples use of language and humourlessness seem to go together
i quick look at the online dictionary google uses oxford can easily indentify words as below that use male pronouns in the sentence examples assault abuse criminal fool the irony of the whole storm in a teacup is that rabid feminists are giving validation to the example given
keep working on it you might get to a reasonable answer eventually you could just admit youre wrong maybe i wont hold my breath
theyd just call him the bad uncle simples
are those two womens children to call themselves brothersim shocked that the author would assume their gender
language evolves according to need without any sort of intervention
the problem could be avoided by constructing hatcheriesconditioning centres where babies can be reared communally thus having no concept of the absurd idea of having two parents let alone siblings andor other relatives
are those two womens children to call themselves brothers gasp did you just assume their gender
do you have any evidence to prove this claim fair enough i dont and am not going to go trawling for evidence to support it however i would contend that we would be in much worse trouble as a society if this were not true im lost as to what you actually want you mention not giving respect hence my reference to a rebuttable presumption of respect i would afford this to every parent as i would indeed offer respect generally to most individuals unless there is evidence to the contrary i think this is the way society goes
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness changes in the language tend to happen natually attempts to impose such changes on other people only because you dont like the status quo look more like tyranny
and his parents didnt think to correct him why should they he pronounced their names correctly
i prefer the australian indigenous way in which tribal elders are all auntie and uncle theyre adults who presumably play a role in your upbringing and deserve respect and often affection its just easier i have a few biological uncles some i like some i dont you said you dont like that other men are called uncle as its presumably a more special relationship but is it really if there was another brother everyone disliked also called uncle would that change how you feel about the term
no it doesnt it shows they are properly democratic the french system seems loaded against let pen the establishment really can stop her unlike the us where trump got through despite being hated by the elite anyway this is nothing to do with this thread except i expect the writer would agree with you on liberal elites stopping the will of the people when its the wrong will
nothing to do with respect my grandmother wanted us to call her by her first name because being knpwn as grandma made her feel old this was about  years ago too after age  we always called my parents by their first names mummy and daddy are terms more appropriate for children
and look at what a wonderful country were living in now because of that
and his parents didnt think to correct him
o like that too
do you really believe that gender is conferred by societal expectation and convention what is this essential self to which you refer seriously what does that mean i can see that being born in the wrong body is not a helpful expression but theres far more misery in store along the road you and this writer would travel than ever there is in the misapplication of gender stereotypes which exist because most people fit them
i thought the word guardian solves most problems like in film the guardians of the galaxy they didnt create the galaxy but they are the guardians of it no matter how weird they look
authority unit  authority unit  authority unit  or if you prefer to avoid implication of hierarchy among authority units jointauthority unit x jointauthority unit y joinauthority unit z
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness why should we presume that children are better off with their biological parents than with anyone else some children have biological parents who do not love them or are not competent to raise them that is an old problem humanity has a long and ignoble history of removing children from unworthy sinful incompetent mothers we are still dealing with the fallout from that here in ireland i am deeply deeply suspicious of anyone trotting out lines like this to justify the treatment of children and wombs as commodities what is the vision of the future that women in the developing world who just arent competent enough to raise children become incubators for the first world
i know but if we dont we lose the argument by default
thats just show a total lack of respect for their elders nonsense theyre his relatives not his senior officers what reason prompted your nephew to call his parents by name he just did so of his own accord as he was learning to speak hes an only child and as he constantly heard his parents addressing each other by their names he joined in
use any words you want dude whether anyone catches on to your meaning is another matter and whether anyone wishes to repeat your new words in everyday language is a whole new matter again if that doesnt work you can try and ban certain words and make everyone say the words you can only tolerate good luck with it all 
respect for elders is so passé
agree theres a difference between evolution and a self styled elite handing down tablets of stone
thank you again this points to other ways of bringing up kids which may not currently be the western norm but may be increasingly adopted over time
id be interested in knowing what other countries use and would probably use them too for words in which english is lacking otherwise ill just make do thanks
wholly and irretrievably i think
interesting and thank you i think perhaps adopting such ideas from other cultures will  save us making up new terms and  help counter kneejerk claims that the nuclear family is the way and this is just some pcgonemad nitwittery which of course does exist far too often
i confess that i didnt read that far but moved the sperm donor what a term what an identity to have into the house what does that mean in practice is he permanently on call locked in the cellar to be liberated for specific sessions are these two planning on creating an entire race which requires the services of their donor at all times either these people are mad or i am and for the record its them
im merely saying id like to see the reaction if he did objecthope that helps
english language has been pretty woeful when it comes to describing relationships beyond the nuclear family the all too generic uncle aunt which can describe everyone from your mum or dads brother or sister to someone who just happens to be a mate of theirs to even teachers yes ive seen a nursery which asked kids to call teachers aunties uncles it did annoy me that my nephew was calling me uncle then calling his preschool teacher uncle too and his dads acquaintance uncle too like we are all lumped together eventhough there is a wide range of different relationships the word covers in other cultures such as india language is more specific with terms for maternalpaternal uncleaunt and elder brothersister even elder brothers wife elder sisters wife english has not evolved to such a degree however their is an advantage to not having the language to define certain relationships you get to define the relationship you want without being pushed into preconceived terms such as the aforementioned maddy label
wont somebody please think of the children
when a lesbian woman i know asked a friend to be sperm donor for her and her wife he said he wasnt interested in being a donor but would love to be a father now the three of them live together and all three identify as the childs parents this sounds like the beginning of a logic puzzle
dont bother arguing with people if you have no ability at it
no just like the way language is a messy fit with the complexity of our relationships seeming wholly inappropriate or perverse at times so is law and family law in particular however what appears on the surface to be a paternalistic protection of womens rights with roots in a different age is really a pragmatic step by the state to ensure childcare costs are individualized where possible and do not fall to society at large in reality this law has often been to the disadvantage of women especially those suffering abuse from expartnersbut what is the alternative a recognition of the need for societal responsibility for childcare i think the author has thought this through but there are limits to how we can escape the current tyranny of biological relatedness especially given the slow shifting barrier reef of emotions that underpin those ideas
the majority of biological parents take care of and love their children do you have any evidence to prove this claim lets assume youre correct i still dont think people should be given automatic respect just because they produced children they should be given respect for their ability as a parent
thats a very good idea the article gave me a headache trying to follow the mommy mummy mama daddy papa scenariosi do get the point that language hasnt kept up with changing social situations but this article didnt shed any light on the problem
really thats just show a total lack of respect for their elders what reason prompted your nephew to call his parents by name
the writers point surely is to explicitly answer the accusation of wishing to destroy the traditional family thats inevitably made against someone when the legitimacy of other family structures is raised for discussion that this preemptive rebuttal is required is nicely demonstrated by your own response
well done sir
i agree but its frown upon now to air that kind of sensible rational opinion
and yet it takes two to tango
i am just slightly worried that you say there is nothing wrong with the heterosexual two parent family as this implies you think there might be its the natural arrangement among humans and generally works well
if language must evolve it will of its own accord
almost suggests that the standard words for family connections cannot be applied when people arent of the same race are you suggesting that i can call tom who is my mothers brother uncle even if he is a man of colour
look for instance at the mrsmiss vs mr problem to which a solution was contrived years ago ms that has only partially caught on not least because of pronunciation issuesltigt i think ms has been incredibly successful certainly in formalbusiness correspondence i wouldnt dream of addressing a woman any other way unless i had evidence that she preferred another title
wants to see no but its interesting how people who arent used to being commented on react to being commented on even favourably the sentiment expressed above a sarcastic so glad i have your approval is one i feel regularly as a lesbian mum and i find it interesting to see someone who finds it a new experience
i thought it was because more people were delaying marriage or not getting married and didnt want to refer to their  year old partner of several years as their boyfriend
the mrsmiss vs mr problem when i was still working in he one of our students told the departmental admin that her preferred form was dr personally i thought she should have earned it for making that request
languages that recognise the blood relationship between people isnt that precisely what the author is arguing against the biological tyranny of bloodlines over a threeway surrogacy
a simple solution for the kids would be to just call adults by their actual names my nephew has always addressed his parents and uncles and aunts by name rather than a family title he did call his grandparents nanny amp grandad but that was at their oldfashioned insistence
just call everyone john malkovich
speaking of words we dont need anymore cis should definitely be on that list
if i were you id use aunt or uncle but like many people i grew up with nonbiological aunts and uncles who were just good family friends i also called a cousin aunt for most of my life as she was in her twenties when i was born aunt just meant adult female im related to andor who has a special place in our family its succinct and most people dont really care your husbands biological children would then have two mums one biological an uncle your partner as defined as an adult male theyre biologically related to but who does not have the role of father and you the uncles partner in most families also called aunt or uncleso mum mum uncle andrew and uncle whateverits not perfect but its faster and easier than expecting society will quickly pick up some new terms i mean how is zhe going outside of guardian circles
why should we presume that children are better off with their biological parents than with anyone else its clearly absurd a staterun reproduction commission should be responsible for desiging and producing new humans for a progressive society a staterun reproduction commission would become indolent and indulgent and fail to innovate far better to allow competing corporations to design produce and sell new humans as the market ordains corporations would tend to offshore the illpaid wombwork element of the production process a trump government will bring back jobs from china
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial familyi raise no objection to it id love to see the reaction if you did
many people find it both confusing and depressing that the world does not revolve around them in an ideal society people would not be able to ask innocent questions like so are you his dad then at the school gates without risking fines exclusion and imprisonment
taking primates as your role models doesnt get you too far
it might if they are of different sexes and planned to breed
that is interesting thanks i would have suspected this would be the case in some language somewhere the obvious comparison is gendered nouns in a number of languages related to english never quite understood the reason for having a male rabbit regardless of its gender sitting on a female table without the ability to reproduce
excepting that a child is not a factory product yet
i doubt a nonbiological parenting figure would get the really tough stains out
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness would that include the tyranny of forcing biological fathers to pay for children they dont want i entirely realise that i am being offensively argumentative but really you havent thought this through have you
people will likewise ask my husband and me which of us is our sons real father when your descendants get themselves dnaprofiled because they are hoping they might be vikings or something this will become readily apparent our current vocabulary seems to be more than adequate to deal with varying degrees of interrelatedness and evolved in an era where people lived in much more complex family groupings than they did now none of this is tyranny but everyone defining language to suit their own reality is a recipe for mutual incomprehension
ive always quite liked swustersunu from anglo saxon it specifically means a nephew who is the son of your sister that specific enough for you
theyve just closed the thread he wants hes a bit desperate to get the reptilian tories bit in anywhere anyhow
i did thats why im asking the question so which relative do you need to make up new words for maybe i can help because again i fail to see any problems
while were at it what about aunties almost any adult of the right age used to qualify for this even if they were second cousins your mums school friend or even long standing neighbours or is that just common not at all or those wonderful expressions mistake and accident which were used by women quite without reference to the the local social services to give their teenage daughters illegitimate childen a respectable position within their family eg sir paul nurse
it doesnt matter to you maybedo the children get to have an opinion
funny that i believe it was those of the alphabet community who forced the term partner which then became synonymous with any couple now that this term is no longer exclusive they haha or more want new words if they could just be satisfied with truth hey kids we are homosexuals thats why you have  moms dads or whatever changing words will not change the name of the practices
read the article
youre on the wrong thread sonny
confused we accord most people respect until they demonstrate otherwise the majority of biological parents take care of and love their children why should we not have a rebuttable presumption of respect to all based on the actions of the majority unless youre arguing that we should not presuppose respect to people should i not respect the author until he proves himself to me
it is instructive to see that while all the loosing french candidates from both left and right immediately advised their voters to support macron here the current government was perfectly happy to collaborate with farages racist party to get the country to leave the eu that tells you just how low the reptilian tories are prepared to go to fulfil their xenophobic agenda
nonbiological parenting figure is that a robot can you get me one it sounds like saving an awful lot of trouble
well most people own a computer andor smartphone nowadays yet so few have surrogate mothers whatever exactly that may beanyway nonbiological parenting figure seems to cover a lot of ground and its kind of cute too
yet another person who wants to see the boot on the other foot as opposed to nobody being kicked
we have long struggled with the question of how briefly to describe my exbrotherinlaw and more particularly his wife who is not my sister but confusingly has the same first name and all her other children etc but with whom i have a closer relationship than i do with my sisterwe came to the conclusion that since we are not inlaws we must be outlaws hallo these are my outlaws dont bother its too complicated
interestingly in work writings i always use they but when doing a course recently was asked to use she very odd
many cultures in which the whole community is tasked with bringing up the children use auntie uncle cousin brother and sister to refer to anyone in their home village some african tribes only acknowledge the biological mother and her female relatives and refer to all men as uncle even the biological father
gosh the boots on the other foot imagine living a life where people feel the need to tell you whether or not they approve of your family structure just imagine
i am sure most things are quite clear to yoube happy
my children arent at all confused they know they have a mummy and a mama who love them very much the only people that are confused are the grown ups
my suggestion is that you forget trying to name all those permutations and simply create an excel chart arrange all the variables you need vertically and horizontally then when your asked about a child simply point to his or her location in the chart this kind of arrangement places you above all the naming conventions
im guessing you dont parent and arent parented in a nonstandard family then because its a daily occurrence for those that do are
what has got to do with anything no one disputing the genetic inheritance what is disputable about whether we as societies impose value judgements on whether someone is a biological parent over a nonbiological one it is quite clear to me that we do all the time
no we accord biological parents a respect they sometimes do not deserve at all
sorry whats the confusion here
people are curious and also often thoughtless or tactless
only if you dont think that a production manager in a factory for example has no role in the production of the final product which admittedly you might not i think the point was that the child wouldnt have come about if the process had not been instigated by this man
many people want to believe that emotions trump biology because for people in many cases they do the problem is biology doesnt care
blood is important if youre talking about a medical history or a predisposition to something so blood might not be the most important factor but its not an unimportant factor eitherand the terms we use are never a value judgement on the relationship if you wanted to replace biological terms with something that reflects how you feel about someone that could open up a whole new can of wormswould there be a term for aunt i dont like or relative i only see at christmas and would you call people that
people apply this vocabulary with a blunt literalism asking adopted children about their real parents in keeping with the presumption that nature consistently trumps nurture doesnt your inclusion of natural parents into the adopted family also make this same assumption i think its probably a good although complicating idea but still
but they can only be used where the gender of the person is indeterminate you do not know either because they is being used in a general sense or you dont know precisely at that moment just what gender the person is we do occasionally use it as well theres someone knocking at the door who is it in our house this is usually followed by the police and oh feck
so whats the word used to describe your nephews wife
not necessarily if the two women are married or in a civil partnership then they would both be on the certificate and not the biological father
if not why not my ex wife and current wife arent exactly friends and my children live on different continents they are half brothers in another context wed have an article demanding rights for adopted children to know their real parents
thats because it is just because a few jobsworthsvips have decided whats offensive it means apparently were not allowed to say what hell we want well if you really feel you have to describe people who look different to you have different sexual preferences to you are not as fully able physically or mentally as you are in deliberately offensive terms go right ahead you have every right to do so youll find however that its not just a few jobsworthsvips who give it right back to you in equally strong language if you want to act like a thick prick youll be called a thick prick and if you are indeed one of those people who feel its their right to fail to show the most basic courtesy to others and are typical of that group youll be the first to complain when youre called a thick prick
no one disagrees with the importance of equality and the corresponding use of language the problem is when witchhunts hound people from their jobs for saying the sort of thing that many people do in their private moments that is hypocritical and counterproductive
yeah he did actually say these things which you would know if you had read the entire interview with him
im more likely to be called old boy should it bother me
the view of political correctness as humourless language policing is so normalised it can be used as a cover for bigoted language yes it can no it isnt because it has been drummed in so hard the problem is there will always be bigoted language and unless you get into a situation like the film demolition man whereby spineless sycophantic people suck the life force out of everybody else accept it im overweight i get called fatty it slides off my shoulders i let it slide off my shoulders because the alternative is just so shite
its the people who namecall and think they can say whatever they want that are are acting like  year olds not their critics
hes been ed out of context end of
and thats pc is it sorry what do you mean
one usually dines with like minded people though doesnt one mate then theyd be unlikely to punch you in the face wouldnt they fucking hell dining with like minded people is exactly when you wouldnt need to control yourself too much so thats not worth discussing two teenage mates getting getting pissed in the woods dont need to watch their mouths too much whereas some obnoxious wanker going for dinner with his boss and a company client might need to make sure he doesnt overstep the mark with his jokes views and tendency to spout off when he gets home to his wife he can relax shes unlikely to punch him to the ground if he makes an off colour comment about his bosses wife
it is a distinguishing characteristic of the left to give offense often and loudly and then to cry foul when offense is returned hypocritical in other words
but in a free society you also have a duty to defend speech to which you may strongly object actions speak louder than words hate speech though legally defined is not a crime in the us anyway see wisconsin v mitchell and rav v city of st paul figures youd get a pick
i have been called a red monkey by some people who didnt like that i was half english and called all manner of things by people who disapproved of me being half bengali half cast was easily one of the milder ones political correctness as a phrase was a joke by left wingers about other left wingers going out of their way to avoid offending or belittling people basic decency and politeness is what the right wingers rail about really have no time for mealy mouthed pathological haters having said that the furore over some misplaced words in recent months has reached a point of reduliousness and diverts from the real war for equality for all irrespective of gender race religion or sexual orientation gender identity too a way to keep the status quo rather than bring any positive change
or some people could just accept that they dont have a god given right to be offensive about minorities with no comeback whatsoever its not 
i think construct reality which is a meaninglessly obscure phrase without elaboration is what is being objected to rather than the idea which led to such a hateful bit of prose one presumes that she means that the language we use and hear used can affect our perception of the world in a radical way this assumes a social constructivist theory but misapplies it in a lowerlevel sociological argument where it really doesnt belong if shes not talking referring to social constructivism then i have no idea what its supposed to mean at all
much depends on your definition of political correctness doesnt it if you define it as simply not being racist or homophobic then of course its an ideology thats hard not to support but theres more to it than that isnt there proponents of political correctness like to pretend their ideology is progressive liberalism under another name it isnt political correctness has its own cause celebres it tells you which jokes to laugh at which bits of history to ignore which religions to respect which desires to suppress which wars to support etc in all of these cases it pretends ambiguity doesnt exist on whose authority ultimately tolerance happens when people live alongside each other and realise they pose no threat to one another this unfortunately seems to be quite a gradual process tolerance doesnt happen because hr departments or londonbased broadsheet journalists demand an authoritarian version of it
how about we just make some rules and apply them equally do we have to segment society into groups of persecutors and victims thats not very one nation
nick griffin and lola okolosie at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable see anyone can play
who are the monitors who catch people out is someone looking over your shoulder as you stand in the supermarket queue is your neighbour spying on you stasilike to report any inappropriate language on your part does your employer use surveillance techniques to try and catch you out saying anything politically incorrect i dont recognise the existence of monitors so must assume that unlike me youre living in a part of the uk which is dominated by this orwellian nightmare happily though and unlike the unfortunate populations of some countries around the world the monitors seem to allow you to express your opinion on the guardians comment is free so i trust it will be ok for you to divulge their identity to us
lenny is an actor who emerged from the black working class he expressed an opinion that many who have a similar background will recognise he is lionised and summoned to parliament to share his opinion sorry but why would british mps want to chat with gary oldman about gary letting off steam to playboy your point is really absurd you might as well whine that russell brand has spoken about taking drugs to mps while nigella lawson hasnt
utter nonsense you only need to look at how the left use racism as a blunt instrument in order to shut down the debate on the states policy towards mass immigration being antipc has nothing to do with wishing to abuse others and has everything to do with not wishing to be patronised by a bunch of people who claim to be our moral superiors
so if i call you a boy that would have no subtext at allyoud think nothing at all of it
nope its based in the idea that people who arent white males also have a right to live their lives without hearing horrible denigrating terms being used about them
was there total freedom of expression before the invention of the horror that is pcwhy can none of the antipc warriors here tell me of the time or place they hark back to when the freedom to say whatever you like with not only no reprisals it seems but no criticism whatsoever funnily enough they tend to hark back to the time when genuine censorship was common in many areas but it was acceptable to throw abuse at faggots and darkies so that is essentially what it boils down to freespeech in the eyes of half the angry whiners here is largely the right to abuse minorities a bit pathetic really
can you suggest some books that i could go read lots of pictures and no big words please
ok you can always find a theoretical wriggleout but i hope you get my point
indeed did you know that lolas charged with childrens education
its a shame that gary oldman originally chose to align himself with the sanctimonious hypocritical scumbags who believe that their right to demean and dehumanise people on the basis of their race sex religion sexuality is the most important thing in society id be far more impressed with their freedom of speech argument if their cries of political correctness formally known as common courtesy were not actually attempts to silence those who find such arbitrary abuse despicable ps if you are going to insult someone do it on the basis of their individual qualities like calling ids a hypocritical parasitic toxic scumbag
could you produce the research on the media that points to a witch hunt on their part to impose political correctness has there been some sort of survey ive missed encompassing the national and provincial press on this issue also which media are constantly telling people they are racist sexist homophobic etc the daily mail the daily telegraph your local paper have you kept count of the numerous articles on this so that the rest of us may judge whether or not and by what standards they are deemed to be numerous for example giving us a percentage of politically correct articles compared to the output of the press as a whole as you refer to articles i assume youre talking solely about the print media looking forward to your reply thanks
if oldman had said that homosexuality was a massive massive evil adulterers should be stoned to death and celebrating christmas was the worship of satan yes take him to task but they are all views expressed by sheik shady al suleiman who lectures at schools and universities in the uk and doesnt attract much attention from the pc police i am with oldman it is all so hypocritical
these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman its considered bad form to name women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts and when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots this is a little misleading reading the actual e oldman he wasnt decrying the fact that we couldnt use these words anymore but the hypocrisy of people who get so outraged about them when they themselves have probably used other similar words in anger i dont really get his defense of gibson though and i dont think his point was well articulated
its not censorship its someone challenging something bigoted or stupid that you saidwhat you have is the broad expansion of the meaning of bigotry as to create greater censorship opportunities
the problem with your argument is that youve not ed goldman is his entiretyyou missed out the bit where goldman in direct response to a question about gibsons situation says political correctness is crap its like take a fucking jokeso what comments of gibsons did goldman clearly state should be treated as a jokeim pretty sure it would be those offensive outbursts about women jews and black peopleso yes he actually did argue that racist antisemitic misogynist abuse from his bigoted little buddy should be treated like a joke
and for what its worth in the sprit of exchanging newspaper articles the following is from the daily telegraph ukip is currently polling between  and  per cent among the electorate as a whole but its support is seriously skewed towards older less welleducated voters a new survey of the nations university students by youthsight suggests that nigel farage is going to find it incredibly difficult to do much about this it reveals that only  per cent of uk students would currently vote ukip httpwwwtelegraphcouknewspoliticsukiptheyouthoftodaywillprobablynevervoteukipthatsgreatnewsfortheconservativepartyhtml
you seem to think that the left is one homogenous mass no but i am sure that strawman is very comforting to you many of the people who push back against the guardians intense appeasement of islamic conservatism are atheist leftist
the woman who wrote this article distorted what gary oldman read the actual interview before you make up your mind i have the guardian and all other mainstream media are not to be trusted
it fascinates me that there are so many abusive terms for gays women blacks and jews but so few for white men but then i guess thats just how power works i think this other article today sheds some light here also the root of such intrusion is projection it is a mechanism we all may use when we have an uncomfortable feeling to get rid of we sometimes employ each other as emotional dustbins you are feeling depressed or angry and without thinking about it you do something to make someone else feel those things httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejuninsidethemindofjimmysavile
so exactly when would you like me to start calling your daughter that slag over therejust for the record slag doesnt mean much here usa outside of waste product that occurs during the steel making processi realize gays are the only ones who ever got their feelings hurt thankfully i have had a blissful life where everyone i came across loved me and there was never heard a discouraging word
political correctness is born out of the cultural marxist idea that if you control language then you control thought it is based on the elitist idea that the public are a bunch of savages that can be lead to the bright future only by our betters who read the guardian and write articles such as this its utter nonsense and most people know this this is why you see a backlash
the term politically correct has an amusing history its never been used in earnest by the left although it originated there it was originally used as an insult in the left to attack othere leftwingers who were perceived to be parroting the accepted communist line in face of the actual reality of the situation in short it was calling out someones bullshit example johns position on polpot and cambodia might be politically correct but it is still abhorrant it then evolved to be an ironic description within the left to describe language and behaviour that was relatively innocuous but still strictly speaking offensive example john made fun of pams ability to reversepark which isnt politically correct but was still pretty funny it was then adopted by a perjorative term by the right to ridicule the left which was a little ironic since the left were already using it to ridicule themselves these days political correctness seems to be more defined as i would be offensive but i fear people will dislike me if im being offensive hence political correctness means i cant call that women what i want to call her because she and my peers will react negatively which is not really a conspiracy of the left but what nasty people call their internal social restraint
referring to a woman well into her sixties as a girl my aunt well into her eighties referred to herself and her friends as girls
political correctness as humourless language policing is an idea so normalised that blatantly racist sexist ableist and homophobic slurs can be protected under the rubric of free speech atl author says racism sexism homophobia are all protected under free speech pot meet fucking kettle
which you clearly endorse would be which is that if you are in a wheelchair or are black youve bloody well got to smileyour response is ridiculous i have never known a time in general society where it was okay to viciously attack anyone though there were always antisocial types who would do such a thing for those types courtesy was never their strong suityou missed my more major point
political correctness was a phrase coined by the press no it wasnt it originates from the stalin era russian socialist revolutionary party as joke critique of the communists staunch party line so yes ironically it was socialist slur to begin with
furthermore and quite unintentionally hilariously the whole piece actually shows there was more than a grain of truth to what mr oldman said the author being determined to be offended by things he didnt actually say
dominate and powerful minorities can take your livelihood away for what in any other circumstance would be considered a minor discretion there is something almost vulgar about the allandpowerful playing the victim yet in reality abusing those with less power than themselves
agree to on your attention to detail however you are missing oldmans over arching argument that its ok or acceptable in certain circumstancescontexts to act out the tropes of any isms this is the whole point of the polemic here that it should never be alright i cant understand why people refuse to try and get their heads around their linguistic fallacies and be a bit more selfreflexive its usually the same social group white men why do they feel so threatened when their default mode negative linguistic assumptions are challenged
thanks so much for posting this very accurate detailed and succinct i think the author of the article owes mr oldman an apology and i rather think us readers one too for trying to deceive us very poor journalism indeed and masterfully taken apart by tyrunn
ignore that last line i dont even know if youre british but your obsession with white english culture and its apparent demise is similar to the views expressed by bnp members
i can sympathize with oldman i think when someone says pc we all picture snooty cheese eaters grand standing whenever someone says anything that can be construed as offensive lets face it all you have to do is look at facebook and twitter for plenty of posts by mother jones think progress and any number of bloggers clenching their buttholes in rage and pointing whenever some figure no matter how minor says something stupid lets face it we all get annoyed by people who say bigoted or ignorant things but i think the feeding frenzy of internet and media grandstanders trying to be more pc than though through countless condemnation are just annoying that you hate them too
there are plenty of gray areas you cant yell fire in a theater or whip up a crowd to commit murder without criminal consequences nor can you defame or slander people without consequences freedom does have its limits and rightfully so
you either have freedom of speech or you dont there is no grey area its a completely binary thing personally id much sooner anyone could say anything to anyone at anytime
these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman its considered bad form to name women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts did he actually say any of that or have you made it all up ive learned over the years that these soandso said something awful stories are nearly always the product of journalists twisting language paraphrasing and downright making stuff up pc is a form of thought control george orwell outlined the thinking behind it and the intent in  most people have an instinctive reaction against having someone tell them what they are and are not allowed to think and say and so they end up resenting it its not complicated the so called good aspects of political correctness are nothing but old fashioned good manners and the rest of it the bulk is nothing but a mechanism of suppressing free debate
the journalist james delingpole referring to a woman well into her sixties as a girl i long retired referred to some equally long retired female colleagues as the girls theyd hardly like to hear you call them that came the response i reported the exchange the next time i emailed one and was not surprised by the reply i am still in touch with all my old school friends and we still have a girls get together quite regularly we will always be the girls
now whos mising someone to fit their agenda
a right bestowed upon yaz by the culture a right she has by virtue of being british like you like me i dont think you and i share much culturally we share a nationality and thats about it her attitude is wrong oh dear should she know her place
i ask myself this whenever i see a labour party political broadcast parading a succession of lovies
people now spontaneously connect immigration and the eu theres nothing spontaneous about it ukip and others have worked hard to make it so the original indigenous people of this country should have had a right to cultural selfdetermination beggar off back to the bnp
i thought pc started as an attempt to support vulnerable groups people with learning disabilitiesdifficulties people with mental health problems dont like the word issues to be seen for the people they are rather than it all being about their disability its all got so totally distorted its now meaningless now if you try and show some respect first nations instead of american indians say then you get sneered at oh how politically correctand the actual point that americanseuropeans are responsible for the biggest land grab ever seems to be losti dont think actresses should call themselves actors thats daft
theres no such thing as equality
its about social conditioning to try and silence any opinions they dislike often by shaming them and comparing them to or inferring they are like actual racists or hate figures
bad and obscene language has shock power which is why it used especially when yelled and spat directly into someones face many people freeze for a moment when that happens giving time for their assailant to either withdraw smiling as they feel they have gained an easy strike on a weak opponent and are in the mindset of scoring in a game and many people feel a bit rattled at such very personal and intimate attacks so they cannot easily marshall their thoughts sufficiently quickly in the moment to compose a suitable responsebecoming immune takes time and experience and competency to respond effectively in a timely manner in those circumstances even longer some of us are in professions where acquiring and building up those skills is just part and parcel of the job it shouldnt be but the world isnt going to change and turn on its head just yet or even soon
all i can tell you is that the word ct has evolved in exactly the same way as all other curse words with the gender issue playing no part in it i dont want to get into a debate over the merits of american english over english as it is spoken in other countries but if the way a word is used in america has superseded its original intent and is wrong it seems perverse to adopt it as the standard and frankly given that i was attempting to engage in a legitimate discourse and you have tried to twist that into saying i see no problem with women being demonised in religion and subjected to violence im going to respectfully suggest that you are being a dick
how dare you call me a middleclass whinger dont you know thats not pc
he tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum i think the problem is when you get to the extremists who think in black and white terms and talk about all of a specific group such as racegenderreligion as if they were a single entity instead of individuals
damme so do i
interesting though that you are all fired up to attack me and defend the guy who wants to call black people niggers women cunts etc once again you miss the point of what he said
the point about pc wordage is not that it prevents criticism of anyone or anything but that it forbids the use of words which are the common property of anyone who speaks the languagethis does not apply to groups of people who have decided often unilaterallythat they will choose the terms to be used about them thus what were faggots become gaysscotch become scottish and negroes become african americans or here afrocaribbeans handy shorthand such as dagoes spicsjocks or taffies somehow morph into insults whereas any exserviceman will tell you of the use of such words as affectionate names for comradesin arms i think orwell was right in his assessment of the forbidding of words and replacement by terms acceptable to a vague mass of leftleaning fascists as pc has become politeness and courtesy oil our daily interaction but any ban on words is dangerous words enable us to think perhaps that is what the pc supporters fear
the thing about prejudice is that it is rarely if ever based on fact i can think of a few prejudices well based on fact
really heres something from todays london times camerons empty euroscepticism fools no onedominic cummings voters dont believe the prime minister when he says hell get a better deal for britain in europe immigration welfare benefits and human rights now define our view of europe i recently conducted focus groups in marginal constituencies with people who had voted for david cameron in  but who were unlikely to do so next year they think that immigration is out of control puts public services under intolerable strain my doctors appointment was delayed and stupid benefit rules allow immigrants to claim without contributing anything people now spontaneously connect immigration and the eu the policy they raise most is the australian points system for immigration which helps attract skilled workers but which eu membership bars us  the truth is youre supporting the point being made here if you oppose massive immigration youre just a racists the truth is the other way around because no one including the bbc wanted to touch the issue only the bnp and nf and ukip gave people who wanted less and slower immigration a place to go i maintain my point that had successive governments listened to the alarm bells being raised ukip and the bnp and the nf would never have had a leg to stand on the original indigenous people of this country should have had a right to cultural selfdetermination and when you say that migration and is and has been beneficial to the uk what you mean is its good for you it hasnt been so great for the out of work bricklayer in bradford
the essence of pc is not noticing you are supposed not to notice certain things about people or at least keep quiet about it if you do
political correctness was a phrase coined by the press it has always been used to batter the traditional targets of the far right including but not restricted to lgbtblack peoplefootball supportersworking class people in generalimmigrantshealth and safety at workenvironmental protectionpublic housingwomens right to abortionwomenpublic healthdisabled peoplethe oldthe youngthe unemployedunemployablethe poorpublic spacepublic utilitiesgiving a fuck about your fellow humans as soon as someone even uses the phrase you get the measure of their politics and their personality
oldman has apologised profusely amp called himself an asshole on national tv in the us i dont understand what on earth he was thinking of amp apparently neither does he but is going to try amp work it out i think what can annoy some people about pc is when an apology isnt accepted i dont think he could have shown more contrition without committing suicide in public to me he clearly holds some dodgy views but is willing to look inside himself to find out where they come from i dont think anybody can ask for more than that
no the poster is taking issue with yazs attitude and yes suggesting that her attitude is wrong at no point did she suggest that yaz had no right so assert her opinions ironically a right bestowed upon yaz by the culture she now makes a great fuss out of despising and white people did build britain shall we go down the list again of who was and wasnt here between ad who the hell else set up this culture this government this society eventually limited monarchical power sat on the throne century after century evolved these mores wrote the literature painted the pictures wrote the poetry all those fabled childrens books you would never dream of trying to erase the cultural history of japan or an amazon rainforest tribe or india but youd very much like to forget the loonnngggg history of britain and what it looked like except for the last forty years and not the most glorious  years in britains history either
nonsensepolitical correctness leapfrogged that back in the s and became a way for people with more up to date terminology to point at others and gloat about how considerably more sophisticated their language is whilst in no way guaranteeing an absence of unsavoury attitudes in themselvesand a presence of them in others
the comparison is bogus yeah well lenny thinks actors should be hired on the strength of the colour of their skins whilst gary hasnt expressed an opinion on that so have it your way
people should be allowed to say and think what they like and if you can get upset by someone calling you a name then i can only assume your about yrs old
do you think the author here should be allowed to say her opinion here or not if you do youre saying nothingif you dont youre a hypocrite
those with power never seem to consider why it is they have the power and the upper hand on a plate institutionally or traditionally speaking they assume they project power naturally its their own charisma and the fact that they are male and therefore have a traditional cultural advantage rather than natural gifts doesnt sit well with their self image and ego when women tussle for power in the same way that men do it is considered unladylike and not feminine whereas men will conveniently associate their own bad behaviour with some acceptable activity like the ruby field or romanticise it as being hunter cavemen or all conquering heroes on medieval battlefields privileged men against aspirational men and theyll come up with an entirely different set of excuses for bad and uncouth behaviour their rivals become upstarts or oiks or display the politics of envy some such its amazing how much mythology and romanticised nonsense some men can come up with rather than accepting the bald truth that they got there at the top not because of ability but who their family or friends may be or simply because of the accident at conception that determined their gender
just a question is the phrase nigger scum or jewish plaguerats freespeechif not why not maybe you think they just display a rigorous gift for freeexpression by the way arent you trying to control the freespeech of the writer of this article dont you find that ironic
so when you say everybody you mean you ive been involved in many a discussion on migration culturemulticulturalism and the only people i have ever called or heard called racist were those expressing racist views i dont even know who the pc brigade is so i cant actually engage with you on this but if you think racists have never hidden behind the too high and too fast line i have a bridge to sell you migration is and has been beneficial to the uk those who despise immigration have always had the nfbnp etc to vote for now its respectable for those to vote ukip and the good thing is you dont have to admit that race plays a part
nobody in the uk shares those opinionswhat opinions if you mean no one in uk has a low or negative opinion of jews or blacks you are talking through your hat
negro used to be polite terminologylike saying people of colourto e de la soulpeople think they diss my person by stating im darkly packedi know this so i point at qtip and he statesblack is black
pc really stands for publicly courteous that is false it stands incontrovertibly for political correctness any rational adult who can use that phrase without being horrified at its utterance in what passes for a democratic society is too far gone to reason with and as i have pointed out before i do not find the phrase fucking twat remotely courteous or acceptable in public or private yet the moderators find it absolutely wonderfulin other words pc is about imposing a particular range of views on those who do not subscribe to themthere is no reason on earth why i should allow lola okolosie to instruct me in how i should speak or write it is the fact that the pc commissars are so selfsatisfied with their own worldview which is as potentially destructive as the ills which pc seeks to remove
wait a minute are you trying to say all tories libdems and men in general arent by definition evil bigotsi think you need to check your privilege
resulting in me being banned no doubt
doesnt that rather prove his point
oh dear get over yourself people say awful things and do awful things thats life
probably because they know that one hurts the most you can call anybody an arsehole but singling out something specific is more hurtful it doesnt necessarily mean you believe what youre saying we as a race can be very hurtful when we want to be children are one of the best examples they hold nothing back good or bad
why are you talking to yourself
maybe the flatmate was transgender or one of the increasing number of initials that follow lgbt and the person didnt know the pc way of referring to them
ill hang with the narcissistic it goes with the territory but sorry i have to say that oldman is a fabulous actor and gibson although not in oldmans league can be a very charming one
be nice and people will be nice to you did you get that from some s manual on how to be popular at parties and whats all that stuff about coming on your colleaguesdoesnt sound very nice to me

blah blah blah this one goes round and round and never goes anywhere but i bet this is why there are so few women chefs as reported today but probably also why they do better at school than they do
this issue affects me every day so no its not
not against the existence of such an article but why use they with the very little flexion that english verbs have it will lead to more ambiguity than necessary they played in the snow who one person or several people
whta a strange article they a a generalising third person plural is pretty much universa
fair enough but i think the argument is that biased language both reflects and reinforces and perpetuates perceived injustices in society possibly true but to what extent no one knows it may be something that only a small number of graduate women worry about partly because they think they should and doesnt make a haporth of difference to the advancement of true equality we still dont seem to have a secure handle on the question of whether we should judge people by the language they use easy and often desperately unjust or by what we perceive to be in their hearts difficult but surely more important surface conformity is just that it doesnt seem to me to betoken an improvement in anything rather insisting on it is a way of shutting down debate in the long run is anything worth destroying freedom of speech for
luckily for you most people will respect that choice not so for genderfluid people
its not so much a gender issue as a writing issue writing he or she or worrying excessively about gender identification when all you want to do is not write a person or the archaic one over and over is supremely irritating if you have to write a lot of things grammatically it is weird to go from the singular a person to the plural they in the same sentence but it is also cumbersome to have to talk in plural all the time im glad to see that this change is finally taking hold i personally decided a while ago to neglect grammar and just go for the more elegant they as so many traditional english writers had already done long ago
i have often wondered whether people who speak french where houses are feminine and countries are masculine have a different view of gender to people who speak english
what about hu short for human
switching to they was meaningless changing nothing in a world where being born female could justify your being killed exactly using the word they to signify a generic or unknown person eg someones left their phone behind is hardly the same as saying that the person if they were known has no gender neither does sexism mean simply recognising someones gender which is after all one of the most obvious facts about them it means treating them differently as a result the problems of women who are treated appallingly in backward societies assuming they get the chance to be born at all arent going to be solved by north londoners playing word games
there is currently a tv series running on a popular us cable network which until recently used a promotional preview which went something like a firefighter is brave a firefighter is resourcefulyou get the pictureand ended with the line and they are human i always thought that whatever the arguments about strict grammar it simply didnt sit well with me they have just changed the final line to and a firefighter is only human much better and no sex involved though i have yet to watch an episode so i could be wrong there
 thanks both
as part of a liberal feminist grammarnerd circle of friends i had a small expectation that we would all see they as a positive thing what i didnt expect was fights to break out on my facebook feed youll have to slow down at some point living that kind of crazy devilmaycare lifestyle and all
thats right just like all great works of literature are always updated to take account of changing language bugger poor yorick we were proper bezzies ampc ampc
that makes me think that bruce forsyth is singing it though
hello he thanks
what are the guardian going to do about womens jeans zipping up the other way until there is zip equality how is they going to zip up jeans equally
its my reality im expecting my first baby in  weeks and i havent found out the sex i dont like saying it so tend to use they i get picked up on it every day but it sounds correct to my ears
i take your pointin all fairness though italian doesnt have a neuter grammatical gender this makes things slightly more complicated
i used it in that circumstance but only got told off when i carried the habit on for a few weeks after my son was born
fine if you dont know the sex of your cousin
i hear two contradictory things here concerning the faith that the singular they and their helps make the world a betterless sexistplace first were told ad nauseam that language is always changing its futile to try and prescribe rules and second were getting there using they for he and their for his is working so lets keep teaching this because it must be the case that this crap is actually taught in school its prevalence is impossible to explain in formal uses otherwise and people are claiming here that theyve never known anything else i take it that must include their school grammar lessonsor are there no more grammar lessons so which is it onward and downward with the prescribed use of the singular they or one cant impose language its fluid where are the nonprescriptivelanguage feminists hmm
as an illeducated bloke my question is why so many languages have femalemaleneuter gendersdo the french and spanish feminists get het up that some particular word is one gender or another
i suggest you read the title again they the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in english
mädchen is not neutral it is neuter which is a grammatical designation in this case because the suffix chen makes every word to which it is added a neuter grammatical designations have no logical basis so they are not inherently sexist anyone who is concerned about using being considered sexist for using he or she should simply recast the sentence to avoid the problem there are many ways of saying the same thing in any language
why does it have to be eitheror as far as national newspapers go the guardian does a betterthanaverage job at covering major abuse of women your comment reminds me of the people who ask questions like why are you complaining about being catcalled in the street when there are women and girls being trafficked for sex people and newspapers are capable of concentrating on more than one issue at a time especially when said issues feed into one another anyway
buy her a tent and some embroidery thread might keep her busy for a while or perhaps she could macrame a potholder with all the genders i have ever slept with
wtf guardian hello editor are your own journalists not already using they in this way like the rest of us have been since as far as i can remember
why eitheror can we not do both perhaps i have more faith in our abilities
mater of interest thats the mother of all freudian slips
there just might be a connection between language and misogyny and one article about the possibility of such a connection does not signal a trend towards ignoring the real horrendous abuse carried out everyday against women relax
care to actually explain why you need to know someones gender rather than simply pointing out that i am not alone in wondering why you need to know it
high time the old stevie wonder song was updated arent they lovey
surely if you know the person or know their gender it is stupid to use they absolutely but this use of they is about when you dont know whether the person you are referring to is male or female thats the whole point words such as someone or anyone or doctor or parent are genderless and have never as far as im aware caused any kind of linguistic confusion the pronoun they isnt really that different and carries the same kind of function
id prefer if y uocalled me he thanks
since the singular they was being used by chaucer youd need to be over  years old for its use to cause any consternation
its all to do with so many feminists being university educated writersthey examine wordsblokes like me illeducated just use them
what about when the reference is to an unborn child and youve decided not to find out the sex until birth thtas not political correctness
there is no she in they but there is a he
maybe we should start calling linguistic nitpickers grammar tories instead of well
edit incorrect use of the pronoun they 
im not sure thats always true its unlikely to be a coincidence that for example parents and children take the masculine gender when referred to collectively
other languages assign feminine pronouns and articles to some nouns and masculine to others english is not the only language you know
you could aways drop the pronoun for the next five weeks and say my babygood luck btw kids are great
too many feminist writers are writerswords words wordswords words words
the singular they is present in most dialects of english it has been there since at least the time of early modern english it dropped out of use in the dialect of the middle class of south east england around the start of the th century unfortunately that dialect has been promoted as standard english current editions of fowlers modern english usage say that the loss was because of a mistake in the st edition of that book i suspect it had a political cause that it was a response to the rise of blue stockings suffragettes and the like using language to reinforce the sex segregation that was breaking down in real life
storms are named alternately male and female according to the met office httpwwwmetofficegovukukstormcentre wikipaedia suggests the same is true elsewhere in the world too
try italian a group of  women and  man has to take the masculine form of nounadjectiveverb
same thing in dublin ive always used yis and youse is very common pretty sure the rest of ireland does this too its not just a working class thing either although ive not known any proper poshos it just makes sentences flow better ah howryis is better then hey hows everyone
god i must be ancient geriatric probablywhats this gender thing that pops up these daysmale or female thanks
difference with normative dative and genitive makes it more fun too
youre only taking one point of view ie linguistical and completely disregarding the possible psychological implications of speaking since infancy or childhood a language that forces you to be constantly aware of and more importantly make the distinction between male and female for example is there a connection between the gender hyperawareness of the spanish language and the misogyny that some quarters accuse of spanish and hispanic cultures i dont know but im not going to automatically rule it out
would you wince less if they simply used she as the default
why let inverted or any kind of snobbery hinder not so much self but exact expression the plural pronoun they refers back to plural nouns
peak guardian
apology for previous post the client has a right to have their goods delivered
weird i see it the other way round ie i would feel excluded if the pronoun she was used all the time
you second sentence is wordy and not required to understand your point just saying
what is the problem lehrerin in job adverts frau hat gesagt is normal dont get your point
as part of a liberal feminist grammarnerd circle of friends says it all really the guardian doing itself proud today from misogyny implied at least in the kitchen to this ive been in the translationediting business for around  years now translating into and editing english texts its been accepted practice all this time that when you refer to a single person in english lets say a client you use they instead of heshe or himher in other words the clients has a right to have their goods delivered at home no problems perhaps the problem lies with your liberal feminist nerdy circle of friends who knows
ahh a yank and the horribly folksy folks they is exact in this case at the start of  the good folks plural of the american dialect society got together to crown their word of the year they plural referring back to folks which is also plural no need for one because the us plural refers back as plural pronouns usually do to a plural antecdent one unfortunately is singular not plural would you believe qed
if the guardian would devote more articles about how women are genuinely abused worldwide instead of this fascination for words womens lives might just get better sooner there is real horrendous abuse carried out everyday against women enough the play on words
why so it does but in chinese it means he she or it were you really thinking that i was advocating the adoption of the chinese word oh dear
i once given a description for my job which described the holder me as he throughout i have been using they as singular she for last twenty years
i would say it was wrong in written english even informal unless its dialogue or reporting on speech
only that theres relatively quite a few of them in the region nobodys really sure what theyre for refuges or watchtowers for pirates is a possibility given its prevalence in the period think the andros one is cth but they could equally or also be for storage overlooking the land communications etc
this is very topical for me im expecting my first child in  weeks and we havent found out the gender i dont like describing my baby as it so i tend to say things like they are very active today or they are kicking me in the ribs everybody keeps picking me up on it and tells me to stop using the word they as they say it sounds like im having twins i am deliberately using they as it sounds correct to me without gender but im getting a bit tired of being reprimanded for it
fgs sexless not genderless
i dont think the writer unless ive misunderstood the article is saying that you should never use he or she only that if the gender of the person you are referring to is unknown then you should use they rather than assuming its he if referring to a specific person i think it would be ridiculous not to use he or she
unless they dont have a gender of course then it is only polite
the guardian as usual uses far too many words to make a simple point this incurable bout of logorrhoea that affects all its writers makes one skip articles that might oherwise be interesting the writer could have made her point in  words
so is you and that doesnt cause too many problems when used in the singular
ta or tar means thank you in english
people say all sorts of different things when they let other people know that they are non binary your opinion about the words you think they should use is probably not high on their list of issues
tarragon to each his or her own
whenever i see a creature whose sex is unknown to me i always refer to it as he i must be an evil bastard
httpsenwikipediaorgwikisingular_theyolder_usage
yeah and writers that noones ever heard of as well who is this shakespeare bloke anyway and coleridge milne stuart mill noone reads them do they im fairly sure there are plenty more examples but since this was an article in the guardian and not a piece of professional linguistic analysis the benefit of listing another few hundred would be pretty limited
correct grammarian ali g showed we the way here is it because they is black
they is plural there is no singular genderless pronoun but there is its they and its been around and in general use for an awfully long time you cant simply wish away the use of a particular word in any language simply because you personally disapprove of it
or or we could all just accept the fact that there are seeming imbalances in the apparent use of english principally as described by those grinding social justice axes instead of changing language as though we were an array cast in the largest live action roleplay of  that could conceivably be imagined we could attempt to change our own actions and sentiments in accordance with a more egalitarian landscape otherwise hand out the unisex gray overalls
he for she is as pointless as she for he the entire argument is false
why do you think alex is a hecould be alexandrasexist
i dont think it causes sexist attitudes or does any harm at all but then again im not paid to find examples of sexism everywherethe gender of pronouns can be a bit of a problem when translating between languages though and thats a problem i face although its a pretty small problem in great scheme and ranks way below running out of teabags or brown sauce
i disagree grammatical gender is arbitrary and unrelated to social gender a hammer is not genderless in say spanish it is masculine of course that masculinity has nothing to do with social masculinity there is nothing natural in grammatical gender so saying other languages assign gender to genderless entities presuposes grammatical gender has anything to do with the other notion of gender it is just a feature of certain languages which is absent in modern english not anything related to extralinguistical reality
i try and avoid it unless i want to avoid a gender designation for reasons of discretion then its useful otherwise they is clumsy and ugly when used as a singular pronoun it sounds evasive and imprecise it adds no clarity and can be confused with the plural form but its all a matter of taste
presumably you thought your personal opinion of my choice of username added something to a discussion of the topic or did you just thinking calling someone who chose the name obnoxiousgit obnoxious was some great achievement a insightful commentary upon the subject of sexism
i use they as a singular pronoun when writing public reports that contain confidential client informationwe often have to refer to clients and staff at the facilities i go to as r or s and i use they so that i dont give away the subjects gender that being said it would still feel way too awkward i think to abandon he and she for normal conversation
i cannot conceive of its meaning in fact i am fairly certain it cannot be conceived at all it is um
wasnt offended so calm down my point stands given the context there is no confusion over the use of they just as there is no confusion when obama uses the word you which can be singular or plural when addressing maria he clearly isnt addressing the entire audience
this sounds like an infamous guardian made up feminist issue they really need to get a grip at the guardian
but surely everyone has been doing this for decades
im surprised that so many people are getting upset over something that happened years ago this use of they isnt new
yes im currently working in the field of teacher training and because teachers happen to be mainly women a lot of texts consistently refer to the teacher as she this jars with me too despite being a feminist because although female teachers are in the majority where im working there are a great many male teachers too it could be a result of overcorrection and a reaction to the times when a hypothetical teacher was always given a male pronoun even though most of them werent men but using they seems the obvious solution here and in all other similar situations and i agree they has been used in this way by most normal users of english for a long time ive never been corrected on this use either even in formal written texts having said that if i had been i would have ignored it or taken the corrector up on their own use of language ps microsoft word has just put a green wiggly line under my use of their own saying this is a reflexive pronoun use and i should reconsider id be interested in knowing who actually produces these things for microsoft and what exactly their qualifications for the job are
to be exact him was masculine and neuter hire was the feminine form of the third personal singular pronoun the gender distinction collapsed in the plural
i grew up speaking a language whose third person singular is gender neutral i now live in the states and constantly constantly pick the wrong himher heshe choice when i speak in english my conclusion is that the english language and the cultures for which it is the primary language train peoples minds to be always aware of the gender of the people they talk to and talk about i dont know how big a step it is to go from hyperawareness of gender to sexism but i have my suspicions
been using it this way since forever it just sounds normal
they is clearly wrong as it denotes a plural i suggest you take off your blinkers and start reading widely both in and about the english language
i have gender neutral friendsfamily now using they for a specific individual does take a little getting used to but one gets there with practice
i dont think the writer is saying that all gendered pronouns are sexist shes saying that where gender of the person youre referring to is unknown then its preferable to use they for example if you suffer from x symptoms you should see your doctor they will prescribe x rather than assuming that the unknown doctor is a he

the paul hollywood use of the girls does come across as sexist and patronising he could have said his colleagues his copresenters the others etc but he chose to use a phrase that highlighted that they were female above everything else and in the context of what he said he stayed the girls abandoned it does come across as demeaning context is all i have no objection to being called love by a shop assistant or a bus driver but dont like people i work with and who know my name calling me by an endearment that is used only to women but never to men thats when it starts to feel patronising and sexist
my grandmother was born in  and is obviously long gone she used to refer to girls who lived nearby who were actually in their s s and s when she was in her s all relative i think

you can call me anything you want but dont call me shirley what a load of beaux lox when i go out with my mates like me all in their seventies my wife calls them the boys if i call a man i dont know anything at all it would probably be mate or la but then maybe thats the nautical background if i was being served in a shop it would probably be luv for a woman and mate for a man the collective noun for women is normally girls sometimes ladies like most people with daughters they are always the girls even though theyre all in their fortiesi must admit i was surprised to be called me duck in a club in stoke in the sixties but regional accents and dialects wonderful and should be cherishedits not the actual words you use its how you use them and in what context

you wrote quite rightly about all the shit in the world and actually for women being constantly patronised is part of the shit
women everyone
people still get called love
the other day someone told me off for using the word feisty claiming that it was only used towards women and had negative connotations we seem to live in a society where everyone has learned to have their own peculiar little rules about what they find offensive and the rest of society is expected to shape itself around this particular centre of the universe its either that or wilfully ignoring such people and what they find offensive option b seems far more appealing

what amazed me wasnt that they divided jobs into the ones he did and the ones she did doesnt every couple but that they called them boy and girl jobs made them sound like silly teenagers
it is about context as you note but the social context of all of this is one where women are regularly patronised paid less demeaned passed over for promotion abused spoken over and objectified its not like women are treated with equality and respect all the rest of the time and a man very occasionally calls them a girl thats why we dont cope with it but call it for the inaccurate patronising it is
sexism is programmed in language an unfortunate truth avoid verbal sleep walking and chances are you wont offend

im a bloke and i cant argue that the use of girl is a bitproblematic if not necessarily infantilising women use it men talk about the boys in some contexts i think it varies a lot regionally im from england but moved to ni in my s tell someone youre meeting a woman and theyll think you mean a  something i do hear young men use the phrase wee girl for young women which i think is pretty creepy as for terms of endearment i dont think luv is necessarily worse than mate in certain contexts

disagree such pet names are fine between consenting adults who are in a relationship but i have never thought it acceptable for anyone i work with to call me girl luv or babe
no it doesnt im a woman and it makes me feel annoyed and patronised im not a girl if you need to address a group of women you can call them everyone and if youre referring to them you can call themwomen

on sheffield buses in the late s the usually male conductors called everyone loveregardless of gender and that included the tough exhaustedlooking men with steel burns on their forearms and no one was offended still that was then nowadays if you dont know someones name or current gender identification its best just to call them person much more respectful and the best way to avoid gender stereotyping in schools is to call all the pupils by their surname only im sure the girls wont mind
beat me to it
when i lived in the usa i disliked being addressed as maam
well you might be open to the criticism of spreading yourself thinly and if we all focused on the priorities we might collectively make more progress

i dunno its always changing i wouldnt call someone babe if i didnt know them or even if they were my friend its a bit weird id say alright love or hiya mate to a woman though i dunno all this stuff is so dependant on who is saying it their intention who is receiving it their perception
you sound a real hoot
well you wouldnt want to step foot in the east midlands me duck
absolutely theres a big difference between someone who doesnt know your name and is serving you in a shop calling you love and the person you work with every day who does know your name calling your love especially when a man you work with only uses love and other such endearments to female colleagues thats when it becomes patronising and demeaning
progressive apparently btw kudos for your ozil reply the other day made me laugh like a bastar i mean like a twa hang onhang on like a drain is that ok
i get called love all the time by women cashiers sorry till operatives of course if my builders the ones with penises called me love or princess id get a bit shirty or should that be a bit button up garment for the upper torso but then i guess that might make me out of touch with my feminine side and perhaps i should giggle and smile either way probably best to get offended and then get discounted shopping or compensation from the building firm
im a man and the only time i have called a woman princess is when a sloane ranger on the tube was sitting in the priority seat and using the next one for her shopping bags but huffed and complained when people wanted her to move them because theyre too heavy to go on my lap and too expensive to go on the floor its a demeaning term and thats how i meant it she moved the stuff i would never call a grown woman girl not even in the above scenario its belittling without purpose
for some years thirty years ago i worked in a paper mill in lancashire the mill dated back to  something and so did most of the people the women called all the other women and there was dozens by their first name or dear they call all the men love all the men called all the women love and some of the men usually the foremen called all the other men cock it took me four years to stop laughing about asking someone for the time as in do you have the time on you for years my dad called people skin and for some reason my daughters fatherinlaw calls men shoe every one of these people seem to me now and then to be nothing but polite and fantastically respectful
how is being referred to as a girl or lady diminishing
context love exactly
i have some chickens and  cockerels if i go out in the garden and shout here boys the cocks come running over should i worry that im gendering them

duck or mi duck is still used to apply to both women and men its derivation is from the anglosaxon ducas to show general respect to anyone irrespective of gender
if you know someones name use it if you dont whats the problem you dont actually need to use darling or sweetheart or mate or any similar term just get on with discussing what you need to discuss
strangely some people can be concerned about brexit universal credit the housing crisis and sexism in language behaviour and attitude all at the same time arent we clever
i do not do facebook so how do i know who my real friends are
where i live people of both sexes get called babe or mate nobody minds
women
really you actually need advice from the guardian about what language to use it could be a long wait this newspaper pays people to find offence in everything and write articles about it
it concluded fairly convincingly that it provides a better start for everyone if the language used for girls doesnt imply that they are cute and small and sweet and the language used for boys doesnt suggest that they are strong and macho and stoic how do fella and mate imply strength exactly i call women my age girls but i dont blink if they call the men boys so i think this is a nonissue for the most part everyone gets called love so thats fine of course if delivered in a patronising tone it probably counts as sexist but mostly people are just being friendly and its not a problem
yes
im male and from the west country originally and i can confirm that calling people of either sex lover is quite normal in those parts just as my family up in cumbria would call everybody pet its a regional thing i guess and none the worse for it imoi have lived in south wales for many years and last year when we had a big conservatory built it was quite entertaining to hear the two workmen building the foundations calling each other cariad on a regular basis in conversation all week darling
oh brother where art thou
rebecca you answer you own question which appears in the final paragraph all preceding paragraphs could have been abandoned
give it a go whats the worst that can happen i said it to our builder only yesterday and i still have all my teethif you have a welsh accent it may lead folk to believe that its a sheffield and a wales thing but what the hell
perhaps oddly and certinly inconsistently i dislike girls and ladies in the same way i hate being called miss as patronising diminishing but am never bothered by love pet dear from complete strangers a guy in a cafe i go to calls me lovey which i think he applies to all older and middle aged women but makes me feel about  i remember being called queen for the first time c  on a bus in liverpool that was good
sausagehonkytonk or sputnik are all deemed perfectly acceptable terms of address round my way but now i see it written down sausage could possibly be misconstrued il put forward a ban on it in the next squatters news letter 
many years ago i began using this courtesy title mx or mix short for mixture it was probably around  after i heard that an intersex person in victoria australia was using it in  the australian abc television show george negus tonight did a sevenminute feature on me where they called me mx or mix and showed me playing my piano solo androgyne prophecy the transcript httpwwwabcnetaugntpeopletranscriptsshtmthe music httpssoundcloudcommixmargaretdylanjonessetsandrogyneprophecypianosolo httpwwwmixmargaretcomandrogyneprophecypianosolohtml
reread what i wrote i want women to only have one title men have mister boys have master although the latter isnt used all that often women have mrs and girls have miss no choice no judgement no need to make up a word like ms when did you live in france mademoiselle was dropped in 
toilets for the disabled are often for males andor females seems apposite
need to admit no you dont what you should admit is that youre a conceited dildo
they will make loads of assumptions about a person who chooses mx and if you have a very gendered first name well then mx becomes irrelevant
that said so have no issue with men and women choosing not to disclose their sex and preferring mx just pointing out why the ms comparison doesnt work
no it doesnt as the titles are in the first instance based on biology men dont use ms women dont opt for mr you cant really hide your biological sex and ms is more than hiding ones marital status it was a term granting equality between the sexes the equality issue does not apply here i could use mx but it is still fairly obvious that i am female it really is pointless and just for people with too much time on their hands
ms is not a short form for an unmarried woman that is miss mscan be used by single and married women and is just the female equivalent of mr
but when referring to where somebody went if so respond they went to the shop or ask them that indicates a plural which just creates greater confusion
but i dont want to share toilets with strange men in shopping centres and nightclubs i want single sex toilets
and it is not as clear cut as you think when living in france official documents still came to me with mlle despite me being an adult because i am unmarried
why would you prefer it why should women have different titles based on age marital status and men have one ms is the only true equivalent of mr so that is what i use what other countries do is utterly irrelevant
god iain can you stop trying to force me to agree with your ridiculous nonsense
we shall say mx again to you if you do not appease uswell what is it you wantwe want a shrubbery
in spanish would mx be written srx srxa and srxita should this be considered estupido or estupida caramba
it depends on what is is president william jefferson clinton
james monroe is the doctor in
sounds rather batty dont you think
mzzzzzzzor millie
or twix
style guides are speech policing nowbetter not tell the associated press
surely they should be called equal opportunity toilets
people will make several assumptions about mx good luck with the paper sift
you seem to have a very harsh opinion of the atl author what would your attitude be if someone in your family had gender issues i hope you wouldnt respond to that person as you have to the author here the editor obviously thought the article was worth being published because it introduces a new social concept to readers and did not think it was one of whining and selfindulgence where it was essentially the problem is all in his head
ah but is the amazingsauce red or brown a far more interesting discussion than anything connected with this article
i think it is good to be able to read about others experiences and thoughts it can help people understand others better i think trying to understand the author too much could lead to an intersectionality between indulging pandering and enabling the thing i find difficult to accept is when people make derisory comments about the atl authors or what they wrote in my opinion people who are opening up topics for discussion and sharing peronal details for whatever reason but the author doesnt have anything to offer other than whining and selfindulgence essentially the problem is all in his head
we give the green light on drones to zone in on all that bogus science stuff political correctness must rule the world
dont be like that i identify as rambo and im going to sue you in case you disagree
care to explain what genderqueer  actually means another fad like mansplaining but ey some people cant leave uni get to be the walls of their petty little echo chambers
biology and all bogus science needs to be banned from teaching in public schools what is fact is political correctness
thank god eliland you do not have these problems to face life is very much harder for people who have fewer certainties and support and face discrimination especially in an intolerant society such as the uk in their lives due to gender dysmorphia
great some modern thinking is to be applauded as a kiwi i sometimes find it hard to compliment the aussies but it is deserved here best wishes ausgirl
please see my comment to furious kate above
furiouskale but the problem comes when they want to harass others to agree with or humor their choices nobody is harassing you people are merely making their preferences known thats it you are obviously oblivious to the nature of these sort of identity politics and the social justice warriors who make a big deal about such things so when drake bell a former american child star tweeted sorry still calling you bruce he became the subject of global fury the cult of caitlyn went insane even after bell deleted his blasphemous comment tweeters mauled him suggesting he deactivate his twitter account or better still deactivate his life meanwhile a twitter robot called she_not_he has been set up to correct any misgendering of caitlyn winning high praise from much of the media this bot is scrubbing twitter looking for anyone who uses the he pronoun in conjunction with caitlyn jenners name the bots inventor says he is delighted that these misgendering miscreants have been apologetic in their replies to the bot and some have even deleted their original tweet in short theyve repented just as those who denied the divinity of christ were once expected to recant their heresy so those who deny the gender of caitlyn jenner are hounded by bots into apologising for their moral error the american gayrights group glaad is scouring the mainstream media for any use of the word he in relation to caitlyn like a modern incarnation of the vaticans index librorum prohibitorum which monitored the public sphere for any lessthangushing commentary on god it has issued speechpolicing guidelines for the media dont refer to her by her former name do avoid using male pronouns and caitlyns prior name even when referring to events in her past source so please dont deny that people are being forced and harassed if they refuse to accept this sort of nonsense 
it is suggested that mx is just another title that could be chosen by people who feel it is an appropriate way for them to be addressed i dont know how that infringes on others rights ryan brighton or how people would feel forced to comply bewildered tigerlily
i expect this type of situation getting invited to a formal dinner requiring rsvp is not as common for many today as it would have been in previous decades i would hope that social etiquette rules would adapt to modern times and seating rules and rituals which ensure there is not too much testosterone or enemies of any gender at a given table are most probably not that important at many modernday social or business events including sitdown meals
just because some people do not see the world in the same way as you do or have different experiences of life than you does not make them broken i identify as a female from birth who happens to be married i would choose the title mx happily as it means people who have not met me cannot make assumptions about who they think i am my adult daughter was born as my son is not married and is definitely not broken if she and i could both avoid being put into boxes that let people know our gender and our marital status that would be great we could be treated in the same way as the other person in our family who happens to be male from birth and chose to get married he though has a higher status than us in several situations due to this if we three were all known as mx j doe i would be happy just one example cold calling asks for mr p or the man of the house
i think it is good to be able to read about others experiences and thoughts it can help people understand others better the thing i find difficult to accept is when people make derisory comments about the atl authors or what they wrote in my opinion people who are opening up topics for discussion and sharing peronal details for whatever reason do not deserve to be replied to with statements such as if that will shut you up about this nonissue for at least a while or give the special people an other option then they can write their stupidity in the little box dont expect normal people to come down to their level and shit up everything to keep them happy it seems these people are not willing to discuss the ideas presented just rubbish them what is the point of this this kind of intolerance is harmful in society in general and i suppose i expect more from people who choose to read articles on issues of social change
no im being sincere but reading it back i can see that that might not have been clear
if youre applying for a job or anything via a written application form it means that the person receiving the form cant make several assumptions they may be tempted to with other the other titles
oh i just reread your comment and you say members not employees sorry nonetheless what if they dont want to tell you whether theyre male or female is that less important than you wanting to know so many inputs on signup screens for the most unimportant throwaway things come riddled with little red asterisks requiring all sorts of personal information that has no possible relevance with what youre trying to do
actually whilst i couldnt care less if someone wants to refer to themselves as mx i do care that i seem to increasingly be referred to as cis female by the trans community i am more than happy to be simply be referred to as female
i give up

world  problem
public toilets are a physical construct though not an abstract identification except for hermaphrodites which toilet to use should be easy to answer if we bother to continue to have segregated toilets at all which to be honest has never made all that much sense to me
what happened to the term esquire i remember  years ago the bank used to address letters to my husband as mr m jellyby esq
i cannot see that local authorities and shopping malls will build additional toilets that lets face it would only be used by  people once in every month or so it would be unreasonable to expect such adjustments having allgender toilets is another matter but has its own problems
you have obviously completely missed the point of the article there is a difference between gender and physical sex
i identify as a slug can i have the prefix sl to my name and a well paid guardian comment piece to state my point
oh please dont offend xe the delicate flower id love to have xer problems
mxamatosis
i felt similarly until i started reading of more accounts of partial gender dysphoria and hermaphroditism the purely brainderived phenomenon doesnt appear to have been as well studied but if one can have a sensory map that says one has the completely wrong genitalia i suppose there is no reason why one cant have a sensory map which says they have only some of the wrong genitalia
i think theres a lot of eyerolling at the self indulgent navel gazing atl
just cut out the choice and people will stop making silly judgements agreed i think its an archaic tradition that we can do without ive always been put off by the rather limited choice of mrmrsmiss even though i could choose one of those without ambiguity
i cant tell if youre being sarcastic
can i use it in scrabble
i do hope youre being sarcastic
youd only end up being called the commenter previously known as michael john jackson
we should also get rid of oppressive names and any sort of descriptions you know like how the guardian is now going to only refer to migrants as people to avoid causing offence
but if you dont want people seeing your name to make that assumption are you never tempted to switch to a genderambiguous name such as sam lee jamie cameron chris yeah but if you call yourself lee people are going to start assuming youre a chav
mh pronouced meh all we need to do is get a few identity politics majors in the us to use it half a dozen times and the oed will be pretty much compelled to include it
i think the idea is to have mixed rather than segregated into malefemaleneutral so that gender wouldnt factor into where the person felt they had to go makes sense to me i suppose
it would be a bit rough on a famous survivalist who would be known as mx grylls which would be funnier if he wasnt already called bear poor sod
or frau engineer german ladies can be engineers too chuckles those germans what will they think of next
if it doesnt hurtaffect a person to accept new ideas why rail against it i think theres a natural inclination to eyeroll when someone demands an attentionseeking change to demonstrate just what a snowflake they are the authors relationship with their gender seems like a personal issue not sure why they need to flaunt it live and let live
progress good news good luck to you x
many women gay and straight struggle with doing a poo in a public loo we sit there for ages waiting for a moment when the facility is otherwise empty its especially excruciating at work really
there are many challenges that arise when you live your life outside of the gender binary like i do i never know which bathroom to use look down do you have a knob if so its rude to use the female bathroom another problem solved
its as if through these omissions the architects of digital forms have decided that people like me do not matter no it is as if the people who designed these forms have never heard of the term mx theres no evidence of an intent to exclude i can completely support it if your desire is to educate the vast majority about an issue about which they know nothing but dont leap to offended when it is caused by ignorance it really leaves you nowhere to go when there is real offence caused
us history perhaps
growing up i assumed that the only way to have a genderneutral title would be if i got a phd and could make everyone call me drltlt if that is the only problem pursue a bs or ms not difficult to come up with a title after all they got doctor from phd
why not just change your first name to doctor so that everybody calls you that alternatively buy a fake title off the internet and call yourself dowager duchess of kilburn or whatever
its political correctness gone mad
got news for you jacob most people dont even use mr mrs or ms much these days let alone sir or madam good luck
of course it does is mx a genderqueer option or a genderneutral option and why shouldnt straight or gay people choose the latter if they wanted to and it was on offer
it depends if your understanding of biology is that of a young child or if you have read up on the science biological science no less around sex gender fetal development in the womb the endocrine system and other factors chromosomes are but one indicator of a persons sex you are also confusing biological sex with gender identity history and cultures all around the world are littered with examples of gender identities that exist beyond man and woman
perhaps try an encyclopedia
faith in the importance of dictionaries they are vastly overrated i once had an argument with a mate of mine over who the fifth president of america was we looked in three different dictionaries for the answer couldnt find it
the writer has a touching and naive faith in the importance of dictionaries it is difficult to overstate how important this change is it is simply one of a number of terms the oed adds each year some remain in use some dont it is in fact extremely easy to overstate the importance of this change as the writer has demonstrated
we are the knights who say mx
thanks for the chuckle youre right of course an issue which affects x of the human population is not going to change the way we all think about gender the job of male female equality isnt finished yet and that involves  of the population and a fight over  years its ludicrous to suggest that  plus of the population are suddenly going to embrace nonbinary and what is particularly unwelcome of late is the way in which nonbinary activists are actually obstructing debates about women being strong eg serena williams with complaints that gender is nonbinary i find it offensive that a woman cant stand up be strong and be  female without some trans activists piling in there and advancing their cause
guardians obtuse denial of science is getting way out of control
sorry to do this somehow i doubt that  this article is the stuff of nonsense anyone can identify however they please which is exaclty the authors point mx tobia wants to be addressed as mx tobia unless and until both parties decide to use first names or some other form of address but the problem comes when they want to harass others to agree with or humor their choices nobody is harassing you people are merely making their preferences known thats it  if you dont want to use any particular title then dont simply leave the title option blank and request being addressed only by your name why should they mx is not disrespectful or rude or combative or anything else anymore than ms wasis get over yourself
i am neither mr mrs nor ms but mx actually twit would be more aptdr o
so much for biologybiology book burning scheduled for tonight at pm
ive decided sorry i mean genetic its always been that way i identify as the messiah and henceforth id like to be referred to as such until the title me appears on forms i reserve the right to feel marginalised
cousin it suggested we all write on the blackboard a thousand times i will be politically correct
simply referring to people in the way they refer to themselves is usually the best way to accurately report their identity duh should i call them i then
no he said
hence my use of nonproblem but mention of jane austen riles the grammar police because of her status as the doyen of english literature pride and prejudice was published  years ago today if she can use singular they as a nongendered pronoun and be highly regarded by them then we can use it too
its got a name frances
they language changes of course and in common usage they is becoming both singular and plural indeed i suspect this wont even be a debate  years from now as that change has largely happened except among the purists and will soon be almost wholly accepted
fair point i usually include in feature style writing to prove that i spoke to an actual person with an age and a location etc and also to contextualise a little older generations tend to use language differently from younger generations but in this case i see where youre coming from point taken
you did read the piece didnt you you saw that there where various good reasons for using nongenderd pronouns thought not
you havent named your washing machine youre weird
 its exciting how our language can reflect social progressiveness a language reflecting social change is not the same as change being imposed on a language as suggested here it will come when speakers of that language are ready for it not when a minority of hotunderthecollar malcontents want it to
damn i wanted to be the first person to mention that essay
sorry that should be they plant their footsteps
they sound special

they has been used since the th century as a singular pronoun generations of english speakers cant be wrong this is indeed the soultion proposed by ursula k le guin in is gender necessary redux and is still the most elegant solution available
then use the singular from of they it
no not automatically of course but having neutral terminology to affirm identity surely helps
we already have a genderneutral singular pronoun it the singular form of they
since the th century they has been used as a singular pronoun but it fell out of favour in formal writing we use this term all the time and it even crops up in formal writing now this is the obvious choice and could be achieved without anyone noticing as its already as i said in common usage god as they god moves in a mysterious waytheir wonders to performthey plants their footsteps in the seaand ride upon the storm fixed that for you 
hugs more annoyingly i notice ive inserted a real grammatical error in the above e it should have been socalled generic pronoun singular not plural of course
is there a reason why the ages of norrie and cn lester are given doesnt seem in any way relevant
what if there are number of people and the one that wants the pen is the only man if someone was going to take them a pen would it just be easy all round for clarity to instruct someone someone has walked into reception and they have asked for a pen take this pen to him
shrug i am not obsessing with it i apologize if this was the impression given nevertheless coming from a language where you can make the distinction when necessary it is annoying to  lack what seems like basic information and  have to add something when you want to specify for a reason or another the gender of someone i can live with it dont worry about me i got used to japanese with no plurals kind of no conjugations and where you dont even to add a subject if the context makes it clear
i like this essay so well written and so much needed for discussion i am still waiting for a gender neutral pronoun for a human being to come upthere is no reason why god should be referred only as he it made jesus divine but not mary his motherwhy do we say the dawn of man man does not exist without a woman to bring him to the worldthank you for this fine piece of writing
eyeirem is good i think all very logical just remove the th of theytheirthem
not dehumanising at all
precision in communication demands that gender and number match well perhaps not so much gender but number definitely nonsense where did you get that idea weve been managing perfectly well for years with you despite its ambiguous number
we already have a neutral singular third party pronoun it
no they arent
we the custodians of the vernacular so yes the guardian style guide obvs
squeak squeak
i dont object love
actually laughed out loud at this
not neutral an absence of its different
i still dislike invented pronouns but now dislike them less than the socalled generic pronouns hehimhis which does in fact exclude women from discourse and which was an invention of male grammarians for until the sixteenth century the english generic singular pronoun was theythemtheir as it still is in english and american colloquial speech it should be restored to the written language and let the pedants and pundits squeak and gibber in the streets ursula le guin 
no because in the headline who is we the ap stylebook the oed the academy of political correctitude
if i say someone has walked into reception and they have asked for a pen no one is going to be confused about whether it is one or many people they only seems weird it you over think if you just say it and get on with your life its fine
no its comrade
we have a gender neutral singular pronoun it
but really the reason this will never work is that transgender individuals are quite rare best estimate ive seen is  of the world population based on us study thats still only  per  so for most people theres little impetus to change habits from a gender equality point of view it might be nice if language had developed that way cant see it happening though
twenty years ago in eastern berlin sie was still an unaccustomed word hence the old boys difficulties not sure he would appreciate being described as komisch
as others have said you works in the same way it refers to an individual but takes a plural verb form it may make the grammar more complicated than you would like but it doesnt make it nonsense there are a lot of complications and subtleties in english grammar and you need a big book to get anywhere near to covering them
sigh
the second closest thing to enter the vernacular was named after american mathematician michael spivak initially e es em e wrote es eyes are blue later ey eir em ey wrote i like em i rather liked this suggestion actually its simple memorable and immediately understandable to native english speakers not sure why it didnt catch on
erm yes thats the point i was making it makes a nonsense of grammar
this is all a diversion from the really important question is there a need for inclusive and exclusive forms of we we need to know
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number you
in frisian grammar everything is black and white
no need to reinvent the wheel in english language third person singular neuter pronoun is nominative and objective cases it possessive its reflexive itself
finnish language has no gender form in this sense and only on word hän that carries no gender information we get by
the issue of how transgender individuals would choose to label themselves is an interesting and important one but it goes beyond that its not about the needs of  of the population thats a lofty goal but beyond that its an obvious omission within the language we can debate what transgender people would prefer after we have a nice unbiasedsounding neutral pronoun with which to complete the language in cases where the gender simply isnt known rather than being defined as other so the argument of theyll always want something else is simply not a good enough reason to avoid moving forward
i find it especially difficult liaising with outsourced it people when you cant tell persons gender by their namesurname but have to include a certain pronoun in the emailhave to go and search linkedin lol
do you still use the words negro and coloured
the most surprising thing im taking away from this article is the sheer number of people beneath the line who dont know the difference between a noun and a pronoun
we wouldnt need too many new words since we could bring back the informal singular thee and thou and perhaps extend them to formal use as well
i forgot frisian in the list of germanic languages which is the language most closely related to english
having a gender neutral pronoun doesnt automatically mean that society becomes more equal why on earth do you think that is why they are required
in burnley the term love is a genderless method of address applied to everybody are there some people in burnley who know the difference between a noun and a pronoun he is going to make dinnershe is going to make dinnerlove is going to make dinner do you see the problem here a noun a form of address in this case is not a pronoun
its very hip at the moment to insist on being referred to by a genderneutral pronoun even if youre quite simply a man or a woman and this is why this debate irks me a bit like the modern trend for saying queer when you mean bisexual its often simply pretentious but my vote would go to hir and derivatives because it at least has linguistic pedigree in that it comes from middle english and could mean both her and their accordoing to context language was wonderfully flexible before the th century and i reckon if we want terms that should stick we should look back their rather than trying to introduce ugly new words before spelling standardisation context was all important and thatd be a good rule to live by now id say which is why i see nothing wrong with just using they
yes but germanic is not a synonym for german afrikaans danish dutch faroese icelandic norwegian swedish and yiddish are germanic languages along with english and german but the grammar and vocabulary differ what german does has no more bearing on the other languages in the language family than what any of the other languages do
sorry that should have been harry is a horse they are a horse
i read the question in the title and answered it
 an interjection is not a pronoun i doubt a word which became associated with skinheads and racism is going to catch on as a gender specific pronoun
funny the article doesnt doesnt mention the single one ive personally seen in use online quite a bit xe i guess there really are a lot of these coinages which suggests a need no
oi best used with a slightly raised voice and accompanied by a clicking of the fingers
you have to use a plural noun form with they even if you are talking about one individual harry is a horse they are are horse
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate remember that grammar must match the language as it is used if you want to make a factual statement about it otherwise its just preference masquerading as facts singular they is well established and while its legitimate to dislike it a statement that its ungrammatical is not supported by facts
people have the right to criticise whatever they want
how small does the minority have to be before you stop caring about them
i can understand that it is thought to be impolite as it refers to inanimate objects or at maximum to animals not to humans and it would not do to give the impression however subtlethat people who do not feel like either gender are notquitehuman hence it is not neutral even if its grammatically called neutral
i suggest hir
strange i use sie for anyone im not aquainted with with close colleagues i use du and those inbetween i use sie untill im better aquainted and then say something like ist es ok wen wir du sagen but to call somone er is komisch to say the least
youre right its perfectly fair to criticise someone for the way they talk i for example swear like a piece of shit which i know isnt up everyones alley i think what mboy was getting at is that you cant force someone to speak in a certain way just because you think its right and thats what will happen as soon as a new word is created anyone that doesnt use it will be vilified by feminists or sjws or whatever you want to call them i tend to go with fuckers
but it does make a nonsense of grammar though harry is a horse he is a horse they is a horse nope
on balance i think we do need a gender neutral nouni think its treating the symptoms rather than the cause but if i know anything about humans its that theyre not as clever as they think this kind of reprogramming of the brain via linguistics really worksinitially of course itll sound contrived
eliminate gender pronouns in some comments in computer code the best response to a request from an employer to do this might have been certainly it will take x hours of my time for which youre paying a high rate and will cause a small delay if youre being paid for it why not even better for a freelance paid only for time worked puts the onus in the right place
use sheheit which can shortened to shit
isnt you still pluralnot sure if one person of a group asked a question and the answer applied to everyone then the response might be of the form  youallyou really needs the all modifier for clarity the texan youall does the jobbut brits would soon mangle that to youll and then to yordifferent problem though
and indeed why should we have different toilets just put the urinals in one room the toilets in cubicles and why shouldnt we all meet with rearranged attire in front of the washbasins
grammatically it can be used in place of heshe this is considered rude not ungrammatical this is lesley followed by heshed love a cup of coffee or itd love a cup of coffee are all fine if followed by good dog lap it up lesley ive deliberately used it for a child of unspecified sex in these columns which drew comments of inappropriateness not ungrammaticality
grammar isnt set in stone though it changes over time as others have pointed out the bias against they as a singular pronoun is a comparatively recent development no reason we cant start using it in that way again there are many other areas in english where we infer from context perfectly well theres no reason we cant do it in this case too obviously in some settings absolute precision is required but in general usage not so much
the lavatory in my house is used by everyone its just called the lavatory nobody seems confused
unlike your comment which is so replete with erudition as to leave one speechless at its pure economy of phrase why did you feel the need to comment on something you hadnt read
in burnley the term love is a genderless method of address applied to everybody presumably the pc thought police would object to this some years ago whilst working in a junior position in berlin i encountered the social difficulty experienced by an elderly man addressing his sons employee sie was too respectful du too informal so he alighted upon the compromise of er and addressed me for two years as him
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate professional linguists disagree with you singular they is grammatical
wow where in the article did it say this was the biggest problem in the world are we only allowed to read articles about the biggest problem in the world now if so which one is the biggest problem in the world
surely it can only be poor style if a better alternative exists
as it should be hopefully pronouns are the last thing on your mind when gender matters the most whatever your preference
to bring a mildly authoritative opinion to their in singular i always automatically thought it was wrong but quite a while ago i read a book by linguist david crystal i remember the title as the story of english but may be wrong in which he said that the use of their as an ungendered singular was quite legitimate i found his arguments compelling it is a useful term merely violating the letter of madeup rules without introducing ambiguity or lack of clarity on a similar vein he discussed the double negative for which teachers traditionally made schoolchildren the butt of jokes i didnt see nobody you didnt see nobody then you saw somebody fool he pointed out that it is the norm in several dialects of english not to mention many languages its not actually unclear only if we use contrived logic
where i work we have some unisex toilets to account for trans and other nonbinary individuals we call them toilets if we need to refer to them specifically as a category we call them genderneutral toilets or unisex toilets
thingy as in tell thingy to pass the stapler common usage
what if youre speaking of neither a her nor a him how does this manage to annoy you so much anyway
i knowthat dreadful stylist chaucer uses it and whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame they wol come up as for that dunce shakespeare tis meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should oerhear the speech
there is when youre trying to chat someone up my energy would be used on subtly alluding to something completely different that gender is completely dependent on
in sweden they use hen the other pronouns are han he and hon she
its true everyone knows that dont theynobody uses the tag question doesnt he or she do they
they use hen here in sweden honf hanm henunisex
yeah let me just put my life on hold to learn fcking finnish are you for real
fanatastic yes lets use shhits i cant see any problem with that
if pronouns have to agree on number and gender why arent you campaigning for new words to separate you singular from you plural if thats not a problem whats wrong with theythem for third person singular generally you can work it out from context
that problem already exists with many other words ive met many people from russia and eastern europe who pronounce beach as bitch for example you can imagine how hilarious those conversations can be
i meant we dont care what you do in sweden regarding the problem you appear to have had with gender neutral pronouns its utterly irrelevant since we do not have such a problem perhaps youd care to make it your lifes work to go through chaucer shakespeare dickens etc correcting what you regard as their grammatical inaccuracies to repeat there is no problem
maybe we should simplify and remove gendered pronouns altogether some have proposed this in a way that makes everything masculine but why not combine we could use he instead of heshe her instead if hisher generally there is no need to know someones gender and if there is this can be stated or in creative literature subtly alluded to
or could all not bother to learn finnish and just carry on normal or lets learn portuguese the word your my etc have masculine and feminine form eg sua filha your daughter seu filho your son we could go on about this continuously pointless exercise
having a gender neutral pronoun doesnt automatically mean that society becomes more equal turkish has only one pronoun in the third person singular it is still a male dominated society where trans people are marginalised and suffer horrendous treatment from the authorities
well excuse me you obviously do care about scandinavian languages given the amount of words you have in the english language that stem from scandinavian languages i think you should read the comments yourself and even the actual article where the problem of using they is pointed out they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate
rather than worrying about the gender accuracy side of the problem lets just all stop worrying about the grammatical accuracy of using theyim from bristol we use they for everythingwhere are they towhat are they doinglook at they in a fabulous evening gownhonestly its fine
i note however no universal genderblind pronoun is recommended if we all use different third pronouns theyll become fourth fifth th pronouns and clarity will be lost i think its more a case of this being an area thats so utterly personal that theres no clarity in the first place and attempting to impose it would just end up offending a load of people one persons gender neutral pronoun is anothers killing insult the possibilities for causing unintentional or for that matter very intentional offense are limitless im pretty sure the only trans man i know would be utterly incensed if i referred to him with a polite form of it as opposed to as a male hes he him mate dave he is definitely not an it or to put it another way create a single definite third pronoun and encourage its use and the graun will just end up loaded with articles along the lines of stop calling me it im a man as early as  napoleon bonaparte brown argued that the need for a new pronoun was so desperate urgent imperative that it should long since have grown on our speech he was absolutely right but only because french and a good many other languages force a gender identity onto inanimate objects that conclusively lack gender i mean the notion that carrots are female and broccoli is male is utterly farcical on any level and even thats without questioning the sanity of whoever decided the most phallic vegetable on the farm was going to be a lady
english is annoying enough because most of the time you can not know if you speak of a her or a him please dont make it even more annoying
shhiti also think the word was should be ditched half the population dont know where not to use it and were works ok in almost all cases
they would not be grammatically incorrect if its use was adapted though indeed as it is used by many people anyway for singular use by the authors logic any new word we come up with thon for example cant be used as it would be nonsensical owing to current linguistic usage they is commonly used in spoken english to refer to persons whose gender is unknown so theres no reason it cant carry on being used as such just with more formal recognition its a far neater solution than trying to foist a brand new word on the populace many of which will never come across it or refuse to use it for it being alien to their ears
but we are talking of english in which we use you singular and you plural with no problem at all
short answer no
im pretty happy with the use of they their them in the singular and agree that these words are not intrinsically plural heres a consideration though going back to lesley ask lesley if they want more cake sounds like we are asking lesley if others want more cake to make it clear that we just want to know about lesley we would have to say ask lesley if they wants more cake
having sharpened my rational human mind for years to find my way out of the fantasybubbles we call normal i see men and women as completely equal human beings and dont understand why in a civilized culture we have to discriminate in addressing them it looks like a form of sexism inherited from old uninformed uncivilised cultures based on emotions and primitive nonrational customs
thou was the familiar form as in tu in french it died out but was never a substitute for the current rd person singular
singular they is the best solution and the objections to it based on grammar logic propriety etc are weak or specious it has been in use since the thc at least and is abundant in literature and speech alike no one objected to it till thc grammarians decided that indefinite pronouns had to be singular and must be masculine nonsense they can be both singular and plural singular they is no more grammatically inaccurate than singular you and weve all got used to that
they works perfectly well for people and when i get my androgynous robot if i cant be bothered to give it a name  it  will do nicely what is the problem
where i grew up it was perfectly acceptable to er for either sex
it is a difficult area more so in english because english pronouns represent real sex rather than grammatical gender in french vocabulary is divided in to two parts that which takes laelle and that which takes leil and the function of pronouns is just to refer back in the sentence to a noun antecedent in english we have he she and it which actually allows one to refer back to more  rather than  nouns the convenient solution is the genderneutral plural they it is pointless complaining that using this after a singular is agrammatical when the proposed alternative have no grammatical status at all there is an unused pronoun in english viz one the french near equivalent on is very useful for not specifying the agent of an action except overuse by inter al the royal family means one has fallen into abeyance if one were to be on the lookout for new pronouns would one want a separate one for gay people and would the same pronoun do for gay and lesbian people and ought there to be a pronoun for sentient beings that are nonhuman pussycats she or it once one looks at the possible ramifications to cover all possibilities the case for reform weakens not on political but practical grounds pc language has had some success ms has taken root for example while herstory as opposed to history hasnt what weakens the case a bit is to see that different languages have quite contradictory approaches french does not reduce actor and actress to a single genderneutral form and is busy looking for feminine equivalents for all professions a french politician was fined for not calling a female minister madame la ministre and sticking to the académies approved madame le ministre how about introducing two new digits between  and 
those are plurals next time try reading the article
futurama went for shkle
greg egan uses a similar convention with the asex characters in many of his stories ve vis ver depending on context
why not just make it easy and introduce hem in the english language e from her and m from him we dont really care what you do in sweden as many people have pointed out read the comments there is no problem they and its derivative forms have been used as singular pronouns in english for hundreds of years and are perfectly correct
yet you support criticism by criticising a comment that is criticising someone else he was as much free to say shut up you cant tell others what to say as any other form of critical speech even if its not the best way to critise as long as it was only requested or demanded with no force to back it up and not enforced then his speech is still acceptable thats how freedom of speech works
english is a germanic language
where didst thou get archaic usage from this is the only grammatically correct way to address individuals its unacceptable to use pronouns and verbs that dont match number as gary nunn eloquently argued
so youre comfortable with the n word i was just deleted for spelling it out or other racist words that are now considered hate speech
we could all learn and use finnish there is no gender at all just han with an umlaut over the a years ago some said that she her would work to answer this rather silly question cos it included both he and she and he and her my grandson used to call me grandma pete and my daughter believes i am a woman i dont know what to think i think the way forward is finnish the finns both all genders have heaps of sisu which we could do with here this such an english discussion
perhaps we dont need separate bathrooms at all d
havent read the whole crock of sht article cant imagine theres anything remotely interesting relevant or poignant in it but in answer to the headline no we dont
he or she or they are my preferred options although remembering to place it in order alphabetical order to avoid any perceived gender bias eg he or she her or him her or his either way its better than she which looks inelegant and is the equivalent of using a handwriting script font like segoe print someone emailed in this font last week so it sticks in my mind because it can be difficult to read on screen
the sequels better actually
mix is the preferred pronoun according to somebody in the know it is a combination of mr and miss approximately
i do think there is a clear need though the nature of language is such that it will not be easy to engineer there is one in common use they but technically it is seen as grammatically incorrect as it is a plural often used as a singular it is not properly accepted even accepted terms like ms are not as widely used as they should be though that may be because no one knows how to pronounce that one properly
 nobody is forcing anyone to selfdefine as nonbinary gender  they exist and there might be more than we think i think it would be healthy to have this as a wellknown option as it encourages people of all genders to consider whether the most important thing about anyone is whether they have a ychromosome or not
jim sinclair an intersexed person widely known within the autism and neurodiversity communities coined the terms xe xyr and xem which have caught on to a limited extent in those communities
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate grammar is the servant of language not its master it is no more grammatically incorrect to use they or their in reference to one person than it is to use your and yours or do you still insist on thou and thine for the second person singular pronoun
well noone would understand if the archaic usage was as mangled as you have used it the thou form was used as the familiar form as in the french tu so would not be polite if you used it formally that is what got the quakers into trouble when they decided to use the familiar form for everybody
is it time we agreed on a genderneutral singular pronoun no
as others have already pointed out they is used for this function already and has always been there is no need for a new word which would be difficult to artificially add to the language anyway
this is lesley theyd love a cup of coffee or this is lesley lesley would love a cup of coffee or if lesley is unhappy they can leave now simple genderneutral perfectly comprehensible and already widely used
yeah this is the biggest problem now in the world then we should maybe delete gender from our passports as this might offend those who are still uncertain about which gender they would like to belong
youre missing the point what about when gender is unknown traditionally he would be used but that reinforces the underlying assumption that man is the standard form of humanity and woman is a variant books now will often alternate he and she or just use she but it still feels odd hence the growing use of they there is a need and a solution is evolving as always happens with language
exactly its been around for ages i once read a book sort of old but science fictionish jules vernehg wellssamuel butler type thing perhaps the more erudite could enlighten me if they have a moment where nonsexual human beings were referred to as ae possessive aer i thought it was crap really their and they is great so stop worrying about it
with stronger accents id imagine that would easily be confused with him
there was a great spat recently in the open source world when someone submitted a change request to eliminate gender pronouns in some comments in the code and the maintainer of the code rejected the change as trivial the whole thing escalated to the extent that the company that owns the code said that if the maintainer had been one of their employees they would have fired him httpwwwjoyentcomblogthepowerofapronoun
well we certainly couldnt use hen the terry pratchett use of wet hen comes to mind here
all attempts in this direction have failed partly because it is always exceedingly difficult to introduce new forms into a language unless they spring up naturally and as it were spontaneously that one unless you introduced newspeak penalties you cannot socially engineer society and language by diktat its just a waste of time even ms doesnt really have a great deal of traction in everyday life i use when im commenting in the guardian but very few other places and my partner calls me a lefty twat for doing that she prefers to be known as miss and it could describe androgynous robots wtf we have a word for all robots it robots are machines even if you built one with a willy or breasts or whatever it would still be as gendered as a washingmachine
why do you think this is only a trans issue a genderneutral singular pronoun would be very useful in circumstances where gender is irrelevant eg in job selection processes
it jars in the ears more than xie shim or em
since about the s when it started to become either singular or plural you should have complained then if you want a plural you can have youse or yall although yall is also a polite singular
where i grew up even h was too hard and to be was often conjugated as a regular verb why did we need to use these scandinavian are and am words
what percentage of the population actually are gendernonbinary people im guessing its pretty small if they want to come up with a term fine by me but like the term gendernonbinary which i dont think ive actually ever used before in my life and dont expect to use again soon its use is inevitably going to be pretty minor but as the article notes the cases where a singular gender neutral pronoun would be handy are not limited to these instances commenting on the internet for example one regularly encounters ambiguous usernames such that possession of chesticles or testicles are unknown and we cant use hehishim constructs easily i disagreed with peterbrit on the internet but i support its right to an opinion ok so mine and your own usernames give pretty heavy gender signals but you get the point
theres nothing wrong with using they as a singular pronoun as well as a plural one other languages do it german sie both she amp they and when capitalised the polite form of you too
she didnt solve anything she was using they as it had always been used the only reason there is any confusion about this is because of that bastardisation standard american english which insists the is something wrong with it there isnt never has been its the way english has always used they
there are so many grammatical inconsistencies in english already that one more wont make any difference im right in thinking that amnt i as my irish parents used to say
ee for both he and she might work though i agree that creating a pronoun is meaningless until such time as theres agreement that any such word is needed and wanted
for most of us including the most distinguished writers over the years its perfectly good style
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate indeed and im sure thou similarly refusest to use the grammatically inaccurate plural you with its attendant plural verbs or noone would understand what thou wast saying
a while back we had the same discussion in sweden him is han in swedish and her is hon we solved it by introducing hen it is now widely used in printed press radio tv etc why not just make it easy and introduce hem in the english language e from her and m from him him her hem his hers hems surely that could work the guardian can do an experiment by starting using it to see if it catches on
precision in communication demands that gender and number match well perhaps not so much gender but number definitelywe now have some arguing that we can use they because the germans would whilst others argue that the reverse is true if the justification is latin i would point out that construction of grammar in english is not highly inflective as it is in those languages so there is a need to be more accurate with our pronouns to achieve precision
i think just toilets would do fine
dont worry youll get used to it
from the oxford dictionary of english they meaning  singular used to refer to a person of unspecified sex ask a friend if they could help
the recent ancillary justice has a culture which simply doesnt distinguish by gender so the narrator a starship ai of that culture stuck in a single human body by default just refers to everyone as her regardless of what other civilisations might think i do recommend the book although it does rather fall apart at the end clunking its way towards a sequel
use of gender neutral prounouns is very important and for me term they is adequate it makes it easier to focus on what people do and not what gender they are leading to less rigid thinking
there is absolutely no reason why they cannot be used as a gender neutral third person singular pronoun people use it that way naturally now even if not always consistently yet and one is also an option although it sounds much more affected in english than its french equivalent
the singular they has been in use in english for absolutely ages and has an illustrious history of usage by such giants as chaucer shakespeare and austen whats the problem with continuing to use it
just change the grammar and use they its already in widespread use and sounds a lot less silly than zie youre making this too complicated
they seems to have won like it or not i cant see what is so bad about it next what do we call transgender lavatories ladies gents and what exactly
sorry i meant plural only thou was the singular form
i think what may have sounded odd about per was the hardish sound of the initial p regular pronouns all begin with soft sounds h sh w y th as if anything emphatic has been abraded by centuries of use p on the other hand makes it sound brand new
its not a possible alternative its been used that way as long as english has existed chaucer uses it ffs
jane austen solved this nonproblem  years ago by using singular they
other languages have this already seems like the right time for english to incorporate the same
for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate so change the rules so that it becomes grammatically correct
isnt you still plural has something changed since yesterday
thats not how freedom of speech works you can believe what you want speak how you want but everyone else can criticise you if they disagree criticising others is kind of the whole point see the last month or so of news
construction of grammar is different in highly inflected languages
youve lost me im afraid
i like per and im sure that it would sound normal much quicker than they will to some of us
thats what i thought before clicking this article deary me guardian
lots of scifi writers seem to have agreed with little fuss to use ve ver and vis although ive also seen ze and zer i read a book recently where they didnt even bother explaining that the character was of nonbinary gender it was just assumed that the reader would understand it furthermore the fact that the character was nonbinary had absolutely no relevance to their actions in the book they were just a scientist who did science stuff be nice if that was the case for trans and nongender specific people in real life
that is allowed in german but we are talking of english
wetheythem case closed
you speak for those to whom it doesnt jar in the ears for some of us does
the feminist argument is as obvious as it is compelling no it isnt thats bloody ludicrous modern feminism if you hadnt noticed isnt about eradicating gender differences its about celebrating women and ensuring they have equality with men having a unisex pronoun is like trying to insist men and women wear the same clothes and have nongenderspecific names  of women wouldnt want it and neither would  of men what percentage of the population actually are gendernonbinary people im guessing its pretty small if they want to come up with a term fine by me but like the term gendernonbinary which i dont think ive actually ever used before in my life and dont expect to use again soon its use is inevitably going to be pretty minor
for some of us the use of they for a singular object always sticks in the throat its a case of poor style
this is complete nonsensethe student antics were to try and prevent speech eg the third video httpswwwthefireorgyalestudentsdemandresignationsfromfacultymembersoverhalloweenemail its exactly the same here with the nonsense about cultural appropriationhttpwwwtheguardiancomworldsepueastudentunionbansracistsombreros
excellent article although i agree with many of the main points for other reasons it made me think about the concept of pc differently to me pc had always seemed like a non term junk to attack union left antiracist equality activists etc with it is similar to how the concept of health and safety is attacked its orwellian that tv and tabloids have made the phrase into something to be ridiculed health and safety is something many people at work are concerned about and something shop stewards and union rank and file activists work towards it keeps everything from factories and planes to hospitals safein all these cases it is regular working class people standing up in the normal ways people organize and protect themselves that are being targeted ie trying to dis normal working people for having a voice it says a heap about the tabloid brainache tory right that they would do that and it also says a lot that tory bs falls on deaf ears to an increasing number of people who have to experience worsening conditions and organize anyway if moaning mra and sexists think they have it bad now they should remember that it will get a much worsepc health and safety amp femimism ftw
i partly blame helicopter parenting theyve grown up being coddled by their parents wrapped in a cocoon of cotton wool to prevent them ever feeling bad and they expect exactly the same treatment when they arrive in college when they encounter something which makes them feel even slightly uncomfortable like a piece of racist graffiti in a university toilet for instance they go ballistic its very worrying
an incisive critique worthy of defending the cause of free speech
httpwwwhttpsgrrrgraphicswordpresscomattackofthecrybulliesnewbengarrisoncartoonattack of the crybullies very appropriate cartoon
thinking for yourself considering the argument refining views is this not how we make progress pc is a weapon of the status quo dissent is healthier than being a sheep to not offending the offended fuck them
this was at a liberal college in a liberal city in a liberal state on the west coast of the us thousands of miles from any civil war battleground or reverently restored slave plantation it was a microaggression so macro that even i could see it an yearold white girl whose grasp on racial politics could generously be called foetal you probably havent considered this in your bubble but maybe there was a history of trouble at occidental college whenever the black frat sounds pretty racist to me had a party security usually dont do these things for fun
if political correctness is about treating everyone with respect and decency how come the pc brigade crucified all christian opposition to samesex marriage 
what a load of rubbish
oh look an attempt to shift the narrative with personal attacks thrown in your tolerance is exemplary but you welcome free speech and a diversity of ideas and opinionsas long as they align with your own of course
i like how you reduce those arguing against this absurdity from distinguished law professors experts in their fields arguing for a key principle of civilisation to white man
political correctness enhanced freedom of speech really gosh i must have mislaid my sense of proportion as far as can be seen so far the pc brigade wave huge amounts of ideological criticism at those who do not fall in line with their prurient rhetoric rather than entering a meaningful dialectic a bunch of mary whitehouses dressed up in puerile thinking
its amazing that you managed to get it  wrong the pc are not the least bit interested in adult dialogue they only want safe words and safe conceptsso in order to not be offended they demand nonsafe words and nonsafe concepts be banned they are the children hereand yes its gone mad these children demand to know when difficult concepts are going to be discussed in a lecture so they can get up and leave boo hoo cry me a river
reading the comments sadly proves the point of the article which is an articulate explanation for what is happening as a result of the immediate availability of evidence of the sort of casual racism that permeates the us and sadly australia social media camera phones allow those so regularly abused and marginalised a voice recent example of the black kids in australia told to leave an apple store because they concerned they would steal something abusive ignorant racist on public transport screaming at women because they are wearing the hajib political correctness so maligned by those who wish to use free speech to abuse and marginalise will just have to get over the fact its needed because many ignorant folk were never taught good manners and respect for others when you see what has emerged in recent times in the us you wonder if anything has really changed that much if black americans can be routinely murdered by those meant to protect all in their community so i say all power to the kids on campuses protesting in the land of the free i assume that is their right
ludicrous article free speech is saying what you want to say thats pretty much it
political correctness is an annoyingly obscure elusive and ambiguous term to define there doesnt appear to be a majorityaccepted definition even dictionaries differ radically if its about greater tolerance understanding and social harmony then its about manners decorum faux pas and taboos and these are all central to a civilized society where people need social regulations to ensure peaceful and productive interactions with others but proprietary is a relative thing it evolved over time with a great deal of debate with contradictions fighting it out and paradoxically also often coexisting argument constructive criticism unorthodox suggestions are the ways a free society determine what is ethically acceptable what is best for it i think no one person no one organisation could ever be so intelligent so insightful so just as to know what these tenets could be none could be so persuasive as to make all people voluntarily conform to them the only way they could do it is if they dictated it this appears to me to be the crux of political correctness mantra when stereotyped the dictating of social regulations through demanding conformity to someones specific constructed doctrines rather than encouraging and nurturing change through healthy open debate and resolution it is fundamentally authoritarian if one take this perspective to the extremes it is a force that works for the antithesis of the open society ideal
the guardians opinion on the virtues of political correctness should be extended about as much credibility as the claims of devout telling you that it is in fact theirs that is the true religion free speech means maybe hearing people say things and opining views that you dont like and disagree with is that compatible with political correctness no off course its not as we all know only too well political correctness primary objective is about controlling the narrative coercing the conversation amp the suppressing amp marginalising of dissent
political correctness in inordinately hard on the ignorant its just not fair to expect them to be intelligent especially if they consistently vote republican
i was going to ask why they beef up security
at yale black students clashed with white professors over whether or not discouraging kids from wearing blackface on halloween was an authoritarian silencing manoeuvre why you would imagine from this that the professor in questions email was gleefully calling for all white students to black up on halloween ive seen it and it wasnt mind you what do i know conversation is of course unnecessary anyway as one of the students so clearly put it i dont want to debate i want to talk about my pain fair enough although i cant help but feel that from a truly radical revolutionary emancipatory perspective if you want to pursue said goals and are so dedicated to ensuring their victory surely paying shitloads of money to attend an establishment so hopelessly racist rapeculturist white supremacist sexist and other ist presumably reflects rather badly on these selfappointed cultural commissars i mean really what on earth were they doing applying for such an incorrigibly evil institution in the first place it would be like people of colour joining the kkk
spot on
hate speech huh maybe because of what you just wrote you should offer yourself up for naming shaming and driving out of worksociety perhaps you could offer even more draconian options to solve the problem
you dont want to be insulted then take the word or name that is used to denigrate and own it as a disabled person i have been told the word cripple is not a permitted word or its not pc but i like it the word is fine by me and i do not give a monkeys if i am called a cripple the word it self actually describes how i am better than disabled i am crippled with pain there is nothing in the word as there is little in other words that are used to disparage other groups the only time i would question someones use of words is when they are saying and advocating causing harm to that group say killallcripples
good article well written and right on the moneyit is always the status quo the privilaged who hate political correctnesswhybecause it holds them accountable for what they say and what they mean you cannot do whatever you want whenever you want some things are socially unacceptablesome behaviour is illegal youre free to break these social taboos or laws and are free to experiences the consequences of thatsame goes for speech some things are unacceptable and some illegal free speech never did mean you get to say anything anytime and more than freedom means you can do what you want free speech simply means your government cant arrest you for voicing your opinionthats itit doesnt give you a free pass to be a racist sexist abusiv ahole those of you being held accountable for your words grow upyoure adultsstop acting like a child whos had their favourite toy taken away and realise that your words as well as your actions have impact meaning power and you are responsible for them and for the effect they have on others political correctness is another way to say treat everyone with the respect and decency you yourself wish to be treated with now tell me that its gone mad
comedian jim norton owned this women in a debate on free speech go to youtube to watch it
well done for avoiding using racist and daily mail reader and kipper theyre part of the usual rants to close down debate
the american university system is currently the battleground for our next great culture war there you have it folks for the first time in history there will be a culture war in college campuses which has never happened before this is what happens a generation of young people are uppity narcicissts who are coddled from birth they see themselves in an indignant selfimportant fantasy casting themselves in the same model as civil rights heroes
oh they said they always beef up security when the black frat has a party this was was a microaggression so macro that even i could see it really now under the current pc climate there is no need to ask why
and the clock stuck thirteen
political correctness specifically and identity politics generally are an intellectual dead end which is already devouring itself viz rachel dolezel and the germaine greer no platforming
you missed it when the safe spacers demanded all the nonblack students leave a public student center so they could feel safe and discuss amongst themselves
much of it comes from twitter typical twitter conversation me helogerl omg dat ofends me u sld b band
jesus fuck youre so so so so so so wrong
whos hindered your selfexpression on these boards judging by your comment history its fairly clear to surmise that you hate immigrants and muslims what else do you have to say
blacks americans are mostly being wiped out by gangs not the agents of the state  sorry for my white privilege but its the truth
well said the pampering is odious
what were seeing unfolding is that the participation medal generation are of an age where they at university they have lived in protective bubbles their whole lives and when reality attempts to pierce through their safe space they try to keep it out at all costs
also if you really care about black lives why dont you start with the black gangs just wiping each other out across urban america or do there lives not matter because it cant be blamed on the police
the idea that free speech is a good thing presumably stuck because of the industrial revolution free speech was no longer the danger to governments it had been in medieval times because it was used to test scientific ideas that were leading to ever greater military and economic power but there is a problem with scientific checks on contested theories about societies societies evolve and evolution both biological and social is constrained by what survives and what doesnt but within those constraints a wide variety of species and behaviours are possible while contestable free speech seemed a good way to show that a pope was fallible if say that pope believed the earth was at the centre of the universe it isnt a good way to show why a particular kind of society is morally better than another that is presumably why allowing contestable free speech about social issues isnt the same as allowing it in science
the guardian is clueless utterly clueless the bigger concern is that theyre not clueless at all and know exactly what theyre doing
political correctness is double plus ungood
pejorative instead of impassioned predictably peevish rather than provocative devoid of irony she has pc down to a tee not that i read every linea bit of eloquence required to have me do that
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it oh i can do that too racism doesnt hinder multiculturalism is expands itxenophobia doesnt hinder foreign policy it expands ithomophobia doesnt hinder gay rights it expands it its all utter bullocks of course but i could do this all day
waiting for the day a campus police arrests a black or asian person who wears a viking helmetit was because of game of thronestell it to the judge you cultural appropriator
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it good joke
do you mean like the sort of free speech they have in north korea where you are free to say anything you damn well please but you will get shot for saying it
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it bullshit political correctness is about the suppression of dissenting voices amp views and cowering people into selfcensorship and silent acquiescence for fear of retribution the liberal lefts attempt to portray itself as being on the side of virtue amp freedom is odious and should be treated with the utter contempt it deserves make no mistake about it the self appointed high priests of the liberal agenda are every bit as unwelcoming to dissenting voices amp views as anyone who has ever tried to post a view in this rag that disagrees with certain golden calf topics knows only too well
the biggest problem i have with these recent campus temper tantrums is the fact a university student in the us is one of the most privileged creatures on planet earth people have no clue how good they have it i see homeless people every day who would kill for the opportunities these brats have where are the screaming ranting protests over that when has a football team shut down a major university over that i see people with severe lifelong illness and disability many of which will eventually prove fatal some of them actively dying i see these brats reacting hysterically and screaming and ranting and physically threatening because they dont get their every whim and demand met and it makes me sick i think having served in somalia when i was still a teenager has left me largely me immune to the i have it so fuckin bad crowd that dominates american racial politics sorry you dont have it bad not even remotely you dont even know what bad is you dotn even have a remote concept of what having it bad really means there are hundreds of millions of people in this world who do and an american college brat black or white aint one of them
there just people doing a difficult job theres no need to make them out to be evil opressors
im perfectly aware that canada is not a country that embraces free speech
people of colour trying to explain cultural appropriation to white people who think the earth is their toy chest in other words people being told they arent allowed to dress a certain way use certain words or listen to certain music because of their race sounds kinda racist
your reply got removed before i had time to read it lol nothing too unpc i hope
political correctness is by no means the law of the land
looks to me that those claiming to be offended in these stories are often the ones being most offensive
as this publication proves every day the left simply cannot function where there is free and fair debate most of these people wouldnt know an existential threat if it picked them up and climbed up the empire state building this is nothing to do with racism it is to do with black failure and an entitlement culture gone insane as the great thomas sowell said it is no surprise to find the left concentrated in institutions where ideas do not have to work in order to survive
political correctness is not needed truth is what is needed
funny the only racism i see is coming from this movement cant you read what the gentleman in the picture has written on his shirt hardly a humanitarian message if i wore such a shirt people would assume i was in the klan but black people are exempt nope racism cuts both ways these are just a bunch of spoiled college kids looking for purpose and attention
this is perfect just what we should expect from this species of columnist in a time when pandemic poverty has crippled the lives of at least half the us population lets wade into culture issues like the worthybutsorelyinadequate effort for marriage equality these various outrage vehicles miss the point it is not culture war we need but an effective response to the class war now in its th decade searching for the proper label to affix to ones life wont solve the impasse of lacking money and basic rights of course these concerns may be too pedestrian for those seeking tenure or other sort of audience
excellent
in other words it is my victimhood you cant have it
and the g pays people to write articles like this
even if she has thought of it in that way i highly doubt she would admit it given her belief that political correctness actually expands free speech its an extremely odd even deleterious position to take
arrgh i see youve made the deliberate mistake there only white students are capable of being racist if fact they are by default
my work had the best solution to combat feminists and it was to make unisex bathrooms as separate but equal bathrooms was viewed as gender discrimination which is the logical conclusion of political correctness the ceo told the company if you cant share a bathroom you cant work here it was a few women that protested sharing bathrooms not the men and they all got severances packages because they couldnt work with men
a bit ironic having a photo which looks like a bunch of students giving the racist black power under an article complaining about racist behaviour
not really the guardian provides a platform we dont have to agree with everything it presents on it
whatever happened to attending college to get an education without all these unnecessary frills is this what they pay mega bucks for
surely there is some viable movement that exists to eliminate political correctness if it does how can we join it in response to this article alone there must be  people who might wish to do so
well thats exactly the point whoever decides what is pc is in control and if that dictates what the populace is allowed to say thats totalitarianism i support all the causes the author supports but the tools for getting everyone onto our side are education and reason not dogma all dogma is a destruction of free speech
political correctness and its disciples are the scourge of the earth the detritus and shit that rolls around the sea bed luckily the tides are these and the small people with big ambitions to control the masses are being silenced and set aside i hope every one last vile little individual who preaches this society destroying crap reels in there own loathing and hatred for ever more
yup id rather someone was able to be a bigoted shit openly to my face rather than dancing around performing linguistic gymnastics but still having the same poisonous attitude its more honest without enforced pussyfooting
certainly the most ridiculous article ive read in the last week or so butthey are coming in hard and fast from the liberal media so this one will be dethroned shortly im sure
at some point you will come to the realisation that in life you will be offended your feelings will be hurt it is naive in the extreme to think that any law or pc culture will change reality i was called a wog all through school it used to make me wince in pain until i realised it was my reaction that needed to change because the bigots were not going to go away toughen up stop blaming other people for how you feel stop being a victim
ive said it before and ill say it again im a very liberal person and i find political correctness offensive it is simply a methodology of bullying resorted to when one is too lazy intellectually incapable andor insufferably smug to do the work it takes to attempt to change someones mind and too juvenile to accept the reality that agreement is not required we all experience objective reality in a subjective manner that is just how the nexus of physics and the human brain works absolutes are a rarity and certainty just isnt built into the fabric of reality relativity tells us that the point of observation is critical just as quantum mechanics tells us that we live in a web of probabilities what you think of as absolute can change with context stuffing ideas and objects into tidy little boxes is how our pattern matching minds work to bring a universe well never completely understand into a framework our minds can deal with if any man is able to convince me and show me that i do not think or act right i will gladly change for i seek the truth by which no man was ever injured but he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance it was good advice when marcus aurelius wrote the statement it is good advice now but it has much broader implications than appear on the surface so the next time you feel the urge to cudgel someone into accepting your worldview by trying to shame them or bully them might i suggest you take your ridiculous certainty and stick it or get off your smug posterior and actually build a good persuasive argument that you are adult enough to either let stand or fall on the merits and let people make up their own mind more tedious twaddle by the same author as the story that originally inspired that comment is not going to change the truth of it and that truth is this political correctness is just another word for suppression of dissent instead of dealing with it like adults it is childish lazy and an ultimately selfdefeating tactic it is force over reason you cannot change the mind of another the best you can do is influence them to change their own mind silencing them only entrenches their thought processes idiocy of the first order im sorry was that politically incorrect to say oh wait no no sorry wasnt the word i was looking for i think unconcerned is more appropriate and if in your political correctness you cannot condone such dissent there is that whole motebeam problem and i bid you good day
a lot of words but in three sentences and all the bs removed what is your point
reads like some sort of gcse project naive and wrong headed the expectation that the rest of the world conforms to your own mediocre standards means that youll always have something to get uptight about
the title political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it from the text the fact is political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it maybe its just me but i twice read this narrative and find no logic to support or justify the statements premise but here is the thing white students parading around campus in blackface is itself a silencing tactic telling rape victims that theyre coddled is a silencing tactic teaching marginalised people that their concerns will always be imperiously dismissed always subordinated to some decontextualised freespeech absolutism is a silencing tactic and i heartily agree with the author on these points such tactics are wrong because they do silence discussion as well as for other reasons so if political correctness is used as an excuse to silence discussion the same shoe fits on the other foot as well
theres no fine line its yes to free speech or no to free speech doesnt matter if youre holocaust denyin or saying the world is flat makes no difference
you can look up the canadian legislation and the various court rulings to get an understanding of what canadian law defines as hate speech in some other jurisdictions holocaust denial falls into that category toohope that helps
political correctness doesnt hinder free speech it expands it alors but of course and war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
i dont like what you say and i am free to say so it reduces public discourse to an exchange of abuse and ordinary conversation to an exchange of political slogans i do not want to play such adolescent games and i exercise the freedom we all to possess to ignore such whinging claptrap
there is no such thing as cultural appropriation unless you believe cultures should be hermetically sealed around the edges ie effectively dead
just tell them offence can never be given only taken
this article made me chuckle its absolutely laughable the most sensible thing in it was the original e from chait you come across as some liberal arts student craving to be the voice for some just cause but in reality you are just drawing all sorts of absurd conclusions and connections to gross hyperbole the attempt to draw a link from chaits mindset to minorities being shot in the streets was the final nail in the coffin of your credibility
wrong
are police not agents of the state
one of the ironies of this piece is that it is written by a white woman and as such she would be ridiculed for purporting to speak on behalf of black people by many from that community standpoint theory highly influential in feminist and race studies would in effect be used to say she had no standing on many issues and that the groups themselves and no one else ought to speak for themselves political correctness would in effect prevent her from purporting to support others use of political correctness 
as a guardianreader i expect to be offended at least six times before breakfast every day if this does not occur i retreat to my personal safe space which contains my teddy playdoh and my pacifier
absolutely bonkers political correctness is a way to control peoplemiles away from any notion of freedom pure freedom is to be allowed to say what you likeso long as it is not slanderous nothing worse than supressing thought as it drives the bad ones underground creates division eliminates debate
but here is the thing white students parading around campus in blackface is itself a silencing tactic telling rape victims that theyre coddled is a silencing tactic teaching marginalised people that their concerns will always be imperiously dismissed always subordinated to some decontextualised freespeech absolutism is a silencing tactic telling people they are everharrumphing reasonable white men is a silencing tactic
is it possible to be so dense that the author couldnt breach the subject of i need some muscle over here without short circuiting or her head exploding the denial of truth is the most painful part for a truly independent thinker if the left can announce how silly all this is they might gain some people people like spine
put it this wayhave you ever seen an article by a man complaining about it
dolls
my mother in her s calls my sister and i the girls we are in our s and are quite happy with this
dont call me babes
do males actually enjoy being called mate by people they barely know
dunno how about flouryhaired is that offensive to grey haired men
gendered terms are usually patronising and possessive whereas writing an article explaining which words people are allowed to use is what exactly
thats lucky because theres been enough womansplaining going on
well i waddle like one swim like one and have a bit of a quacky voice so i guess i must be
my favourite nottingham mode of address is youth applied to males from the age of  to 
edit default first name to mary if unknown eg steady on mary
are guys american males mate is a horrible word used by people like greg wallace when talking to people he barely knows what is a dude an american male
tank feck i no longer have to go out on the pull wouldnt be able to use any of the chat up lines some of which actually worked
my missus refers to everyone as love male or female it has no underlying control or possession subtext its just a term of endearment she has grown up with more bizarrely my teenage daughter and her mates again all genders refer to each other as darlin but only when they are disagreeing about something almost like a way of dealing the others point however when they are all doing it and seem fine with it the conversations do sound a little odd
im a geordie and i bet my goony is prettier than yours hinny
exactly and as a man i am quite happy to be called mate luv bab yes i live in the midlands its all about intent if a friend swears at me in a warm hearted way eg you daft bastard its all good but if a stranger insults me ill be offended overanalysing throwaway remarks from paul holywood is taking this waaay too far
luv cat flower lassie hen ducks dutch maid darling the list of dialectical variation is endless i think for most folk it depends on how and where the term is used rather then ifit would be sad to see the language stripped bare as it where by their removal
i generally say bird its less patronising i grew up in the s though we were more enlightened
im glad you didnt feel disempowered as a woman because he dared open the door for you but thats another topic all together
but are you a duck
or in devon mdear
use first name or sweet cheeks cant go wrong
no they dont like that one either
this has always been an issue for me what do you call women that you dont know the name of with guys its easy theres mate but all the words for women make you sound like a creep or an old dude
any other term which is wellintended and polite thats the key to it the problems which some of the comments are missing are when the terms are used dismissively it doesnt happen less than it did but i still hear it i dont mind when its ironic and obviously so but when its a form of putting people down its not on that said a friend can put so much disdain into calling somebody sweetheart that although i should disapprove i end up smirking
thats fowl language
can you knock off a few words doesnt really matter what about sure no problem
like everything in life it is about intent mate is the most often used male monicker in a workplace i think we could gender neutralise friendly labels if we want to but it will not stop the sexism like everything in life it is about intent princess can be used in just a friendly banter way or to be patronising way the word itself is meaningless
ive lately become confused by every article referencing actors as male and female not every article a couple of days back a guardian article referred to a trans actress you can just imagine the smoke coming out of the writers ears debating between using actress and being accused of sexism or using actor and being accused of transphobia
never go to bristol men and women refer to each other as my lover on a daily basis the horror the horror
oh for goodness sake grow up this is just professonal offence taking i often use love and dear as an endearment and no woman i know has taken offence same with calling a group of women girls what am i supposed to call them ladies ok things girls actually has a positive effect i think as it makes women feel youthful
and i can see why in the immortal words of the macc lads she bangs like a shithouse door when the plagues in town
my  year old mum always refers to  meeting the girls when she goes out for coffee with her friends however she like me hates being called darling or sweetheart by people  years her junior now thats patronising
pupils id guess the answer is in your question
context and nuance are everything when it comes to language which is why middleclass thoughtpolicing of it gets such a poor reaction from those of us who are not homecounties poshos move around the country spend time with work with socialise with people who are a bit more normal and it will be observed that whilst it is absolutely possible to use a word like girls in a loaded and negative way the reverse is also true  next year someone refers to me as one of the boys i will cope i will not allow this to affect my life if ever it does i am happy to discuss it with the individual who applied that word to me get thee to bristol my lover then work work out whether that is said in any way offensively ill give you a clue it isnt
throughout literature feisty is often used to describe men really what kind of literature
i call everyone pet lamb and a group of us  year old women recently have been addressed with hello you guys by waitersall good fun
just makes me think of the goonies tbh
wow with all that is going on in the world you worry about this a more serious issue is the fact that spursspurs have topped their group
just stamp your foot repeatedly and shout thats not my name thats not my name thats not my name
my lover is pretty common here in bristol too
surely the article should have suggested a catch all female term that is not potentially offensive
how about people
ive never encountered that anywhere else either and i think its absolutely brilliant as a nonnative ive never had the nerve to try it yet
with all the shit going on in the world right now this is what you choose to worry about
i think you undermined the entire article by using the phrase fox in your opening sentence wether it was meant ironically or not it would appear those social stereotypes are deeply ingrained in all levels and sectors of society
yes i wouldnt dream of calling my students anything apart from their names i actually find it hard to believe that a teacher called the children love or mate
yes through his mouth
i work in a library and i can tell you that what i most loathe is being called darling invariably by some middleaged lech who leans over the counter and follows up his unwanted endearment with a prolonged leer at my badge in the regulation place ie on the right side of my chest and calling me by my name its overfamiliar unnecessary he only wants to go on the computers not a night out and from some people frankly disturbing i know of several colleagues over the years who have attracted stalkers i was once followed round the library by a man who i was later informed was a registered sex offender and its not that long since we had to eject one of our visitors for highly inappropriate behaviour in front of mothers and small childrengirls in a social context seems ok i refer to some of the members of my circle as the girls and also to the male contingent as the boys or the lads but i can imagine how it would rankle in a work context
also are we allowed to use words like boisterous only to women for men it should be girlsterous
i was once accused of being a decent looking sort of cove by a landlord as justification for accepting a cheque with only my word as my bond imagine how upset i was to be referred to as a coastal feature
the simple fact that people cannot refer to girls as girls at the girls school association annual conference highlights how ridiculous modern language has become and how the people taking offence actually harms progression and builds barriers
i was quite put out last time i was in paris and found that id graduated to madame
i worked in nottingham for a while and was called duck but by people of every age and gender ive yet to recover from the trauma and wonder if i ever will
they cant be because knowing hollywood most of the oscars would go to men regardless of how well women performed having an award for both sexes makes it perfectly fair
im guessing gulagit had better not be class or well be off on another one
i just use people it covers all bases
pupils
yes the bristol love is gender neutral as is flower funnily enough its an interesting part of the local vernacular and id resent its suppression by the chronically righton
königin schwamm
men shouldnt be allowed to use words without adult supervision
how about jesusladyjesus what a load of bollocksladybollocks
as a male living in sheffield as i have done for  years i always admire the local quirk whereby men refer to everyone even and especially each other as luv it took me many years and some bravado before i dared to try it out on a stranger no one so much as bats an eyelid it feels strangely empowering to say cheers luv to the stone skinhead whos just held a door open for you
dont worry hon soon there will be an article written that will mansplain it for us poor dears
i hope you chewed his shoes
a lot of this is down to regional dialect it would be a real shame to see all that go and have everyone speak in a bland centrallyapproved lexicon
blokes have the catchall guys which works as an inoffensive ageindependent term girls and women dont seem to have an equivalent maybe they need one ladies perhaps
ok so you dont like being called a girl rebecca well try to remember that if we ever come into contact with you
the guardian shed its own northern roots long ago
everybody or everyone
i just looked up seakittens christ on a bleeding bike
i read through the article waiting to see which term you would prefer to be used instead but you didnt really offer one blokes have the catchall guys which works as an inoffensive ageindependent term girls and women dont seem to have an equivalent maybe they need one guys does seem to be used increasingly in a genderneutral way but this isnt to everyones tastes theres also folks but that tends to leave one sounding like george w bush
excellent point an old hippy once called me cat so i gave him a dead mouse
dont go to cornwall we call everyone my bird and my lover women and men
my daughter and i both call her gerbils the boys so what this whole gender thing has gone too far and actually weakens the far more important discussion on equality cmon guardian get with the programme youre in danger of disappearing up your nongender specific derrière
we have an office dog and so can blame all farting on her sexist i know
go and spend some time with the friendly people in the northeast pet
jesus what a load of bollocks cant use jesus as its a gendered namecant use bollocks as theyre gender specific
then dont be guilty and feel the need to defend yourself youve got nothing to feel guilty about at all
yeah but it was a couple of years ago these days they recycle articles weekly 
and you will get it again until you change you ways
urgh hear
but it made me think of the countless times ive been called a girl for a long time i didnt mind at all but around the age of  it started to become a mild irritant perhaps now you would prefer old girl as being more appropriate what a bizarre article on a trivial issue as a woman i am happy to be addressed as luv darling sweetie missy missus honey princess even when the speaker hasnt farted and any other term which is wellintended and polite i cant recall ever feeling patronised by such terms
my boss once said good boy to me it wasnt so much the words that upset me but the lack of bonio or other dog treat to go with it
here in bristol all the female checkout operators call me love or my love and while it annoys my better half i got used to it after a while in glasgow females are doll and men are big man or wee man and i think most of the time its meant in a friendly jovial way and nobody should get offended by it over the years ive been called worse by unfriendly bullies after all
exactly i do wish we could all get off this
yawn
ah the odious ubiquitous you guys another like less than awesome import from the land of the prom
but had he just farted
brace yourself for the backlash rebecca even guardian readers with the exception of a few loons think its ok to say girl luv babe etc so that will be about  of the population who think you are talking crap
dont worry the guardian is not that influential among the general public after all we still do not have seakittens
not really as how other people self identify is really none of your business where all that is asked of you is that you are polite and respectful when dealing with others of whom are not you how you would like to be treated yourself
does this guy you know not know whether he is a man or a woman thats the only time youd use a genderless pronoun of a single individual its fine to refer to a man as he or him its less fine to default to the male when discussing a mixed group and that is currently the standard form in english
at the start of  the good folks of the american dialect society got together to crown their word of the year they see what im doing here have decided that the word could now be used as a singular pronoun flexing the english language so a plural could denote a singular genderless individual why cant they just sod off
why surely that precludes you working in lots of different industries like all the industries mainly staffed by women or associated with producing things for women not to mention all the industries where men use she as the pronoun for the product
very true i only ever come across this problem in legal documents where theres usually a clause saying he also means she they etc for the most part this issue is solved
its called being progressive as opposed to say conservative that focuses on the past and the reinforcement of the past as if our futures are to be defined by the past and in being defined by the past set to repeat the mistakes of the past to all our detriment
she still does all the housework oxford dictionaries can be sexist in its definitions but this is not a good example the adverb still implies some kind of criticism of the status quo amplified by the inclusion of the word all
steve also works ive found
on a point of language it would be nice if you are british to use aeroplane instead of airplane if you are american youre forgiven
john and jane popped in they said bert had died you would say either john or jane and not he or she or you would if you wanted a grammatically correct and informative sentence saying he or she doesnt clarify who said it because it presupposes the genders of the owners of the names and would be ugly
according to wikipedia im confusing sex and gender gender is what you call yourself so the he she they thing is like hoop jumping and readily abusable by those looking to take offence perhaps im being too simplistic
also for all those who rebel against the idea of agreeing a plural pronoun with a singular noun you do realise that you is historically plural right if you find it that objectionable feel free to start saying thou instead
and to think there are those nasty people out there who regard parts of the political left to be full of idiots virtue signallers and the permanently offendedif only they could read this highly intelligent reasoned and in no way stark raving mad article
the problem is that language and especially a generally closed system such as personal pronouns cannot be changed in anything like a short period of time it defies the findings of historical linguistics
its a nobrainer if you ask me already in use in the spoken language so anyone with a reasonable level of english will understand what is meant by the pronoun in its context and solves the issue of gender discrimination entirely
i call every man woman and child i meet jackie works fine
but it is in the very nature of language to keep improving balls with respect the last thirty years or so have seen a steady impoverishment of language as people have become more and more fearful of being slammed for saying the wrong thing all colour is being draimed from the language replaced by safely bland locutions that cant give offence to anyone this is regardless of the distinction between not being unkind to the genuinely worseoff which is and always was called decency and obliging those who are desperately looking for a chance to be offended language will continue to worsen unless we allow people to say whatever they like and then discuss with them if we think theres something wrong with it
i rather think that you are the person who has missed the point i knew i should have put goak hear at the beginning
interestingly perhaps the tories rejected the gender identity that would use the term they last september with their rejection of non binary where i believe their reason for doing so was patronising to the british people in that they suggested it would be too cnfusing for little old britons to get their head around the fact that there is not just male and female in this country that purpportedly supports the right to self identify non binary people have zero rights in this country lest of all the right to self identify
what about she as an allencompassing pronoun
agonising no front page news no
while the push to use they as a genderless pronoun is new for english the word they with its counterparts them their and themselves as a singular pronoun to refer to a person of unspecified gender has been used since at least the th century oxford dictionaries httpwwwoxforddictionariescomdefinitionenglishthey
i find that yall works just as well and infuriates just about everyone to boot
again not relevant if the author cared they would say john said or jane said if you replace they with he or she its actually more cumbersome
fyi not all countries are masculine in french eg australia and nz are femininewhich would no doubt appall them but canada is masculine
what a time to be alive
well in english you never know whether you refers to singular or plural while most languages have separate words for oneperson you and a group you its usually understood from the context and its rarely a problem except for translations
i have manc and scouse friends who routinely use yous i like it and use it where appropriate
i dont understand how gender can be fluid humans dont metamorphose i accept that you can be born anywhere on the non binary spectrum but once you are what you are then you are what you are
do you deny non binary identities 
isnt berts tragic death more important than who told us about it
how do my kids know if to expect a woman or a man for a teacher perhaps they should just wait and see they also wont know whether to expect an old or young teacher or the colour of their skin but hey im sure theyll cope
they see what im doing here have decided that the word could now be used as a singular pronoun flexing the english language so a plural could denote a singular genderless individual a great achievement for themkind
they both said it not necessarily simultaneously not necessarily both in actual words but no other meaning is good english however you look at it john and jane popped in he said bert had diedit doesnt work does it if it were just one of them you wouldnt use a pronoun john and jane popped in jane said bert had died
tarragon each pupil is responsible for their own books is wrong pupils are responsible for their own books is correct as is each pupil is responsible for his or her books
they is already used in reference to myself by the polite and officious through a non binary identity
stop larkin about
just dont let them remove your crusts until you are sure
dont let the door hit you on the way out
yes because language in and off itself causes prejudice such nonsense
yeah youve missed the point nobody is suggesting using they to refer to a single guy the article is suggesting that you use they when the gender of the single person is unknown or irrelevant and forcing a singular pronoun on it indicates a certainty about gender that does not exist so if you pedantically wanted to hide whether the person in your ation was straight or a lesbian i suppose you could say a person i know got into serious trouble because they were seeing two different women i really doubt many people would notice anything strange or new about that construction its already pretty ubiquitous isnt it
he said how could he hes dead
what a gogetter you are
im not pulling rank rather the opposite admitting defeat but even from the lofty eminence of my higher degree in linguistics i cant make any sense of that at all do you mean a parent or a child is presumed to be male for grammatical purposes id understand that even if im not sure its true can you elucidate
of course it doesnt work thats the point
nor this for its use to cause any consternation i find it consternating whether you agree or not
yaya is cute but it sounds like a genderneutral euphemism for ones genitalshen is also cute but it wouldnt work in english since referring to someone as hen would suggest that they see what i did there were a chicken
perhaps odd was a poor choice of word illogical to me at least i never did quite know what qualify is meant to mean anyway the dictionary says limit or modify a noun which at first seems to make sense but then if the possessive changes form surely it is the noun that is modifying the possessive and not the other way round limit has more relevance i think as someone struggling to improve my french now that i live there it just gets hard to juggle everything at once some days good luck with the kids
exactly like paying bills eating finding a job that is half decent
i think you are quite wrong finno ugric
yeah because everyone in the englishspeaking world is familiar with that one instance
this strikes me as one of those solutions in search of a problem which we see so much of these days
youd clearly get on with my mum famously it annoys her no end so im going to continue saying they until the birth
remus you say you is a plural pronoun and we seem to manage with it just fine correct it is also a singular pronoun interestingly the german language of which english has much in common differentiates in the written form between you sie and they sie by the presence or otherwise of an initial capital i wont dwell on other niceties such as the familiar singular du or the familiar plural ihr or the affect of case and gender digressing slightly there are six ways of expressing the definite article depending on gender and case namely der die das dem den and des it seems to me that english doesnt have all that much of a problem
largely irrelevant what about the tory imposed economic apartheid
just use they when gender is unknown or not relevant
john and jane popped in they said bert had died who said he did or she did or they both did simultaneously
im not trolling there are perfectly acceptable rules for using they in sentences no need to change them merely because the pronoun stands for one person rather than many hilary cant come to the phone right now theyre having a bath
it would usually be obvious from the context sentences dont generally occur in isolation
nope im proof youre wrong about that im well under  years oldand i never bothered to read chaucer by the way and i like all my school peers was taught that one used he and him and his for the impersonal singular pronounsnever they or them or theirs if we misused these in school our graded papers were marked down in grade now you can claim a lot of things that you like things the way theyre done now or that you have no personal experience of the time i describe or that none of it matters now to you or anyone else except me but you cant claim that what i testify to here as my experience isnt true or never happended that no you cannot by fucking goddamn claim that no sir
nothing wrong even if you do know their sex
i dont think your example works though by its nature it doesnt call for a genderless personal pronoun
people freaking about the use of could of in informal spoken english but does that actually happen in written english i think its bad but in spoken english its just another pronunciation of couldve
if they used his for the man and her for the woman no one would have to wince its only a bit of code
i think this use is pretty well established in british english but not so much in american english i think in ae gender and number agreement is more strictly observed and this is why some posters find the use of they etc in reference to a singular noun more difficult to accept
jus cos uze got amerkan readers dusnt meen uze gotta spell an talk like them maybe they read the gardyan cos they thot it was kwality
alex is a they obviously
like the vast majority of people who speak english they take a pretty binary view of the world quelle horreur
father forgive them for they know not what they do oi are you calling me fat they said
most of the people saying this is political correctness gone mad probably havent even noticed that they is already used a singular all the time in spoken english the only issue is that grammatical overcorrection has taught some of us that this was wrong its a perfect solution because its already used and doesnt sound unnatural to the ear in the way heshe zhe and the rest do i selfevaluate myself as pretty good on the whole grammar thing but i can honestly say it would never have occurred to me that the sentence someone has left their phone behind had anything wrong with it and it makes much more logical sense than someone has left his phone behind
a guy i know got into serious trouble because they were seeing two different women and they found out about their twotiming neither of them ever spoke to them ever again but then they have always had this unfortunate tendency to complicate things for themselves i told them to learn their lesson and when they were next in a relationship not to lie to their partner but to tell them the truth about themselves
my english may be great but my typing clearly not ill try that again i think its that we have to reconstruct our entire civilisation because the  who are not sure or dont mind whether theyre male or female dont feel theyre being well catered for i may be oversimplifying it a bit but that seems to be it
hey if you say youre a jam sandwich youre a jam sandwich you dont look like any jam sandwich ive ever seen but thats cool
i wouldnt have thought that it inspired women to science when in texts ive seenthe experimenter is heive rarely noticed otherwise
you is the plural form its also one of the indefinite forms if you want to go to leeds you have to take the m and yet nobody seems to have much problem deciding who you is in any given instance i think they is equally unproblematic in practice and its day will come
i think its that we have to reconstruct our entire civilisation because the  who are not sure or dont mind whether theyre male and female dont feel theyre not being well catered for i may be oversimplifying it a bit but that seems to be it
in the middle
i wouldnt say its odd id just say that thats how it is in frenchbeing pedantic as is my wont perhaps rather too frequently i wouldnt say that the possessive his in my sentence describes the owner he nor does it describe the object toothbrush i believe the grammatical term is qualify no doubt in this ks spag week i should know rather than believethink but im the first to recognise that i am far from perfect
good old guardian still agonising about the important stuff

what is truly amazing is that it is the guardian of all papers in the uk that is publishing stuff like this lectures on how guardian readers should write when its own staff is long known to have been in a multidecaade retreat from demonstrating englishlanguage competence f this telegraph costs et al here i come
this matter of style has long since been considered at length undoubtedly grammar rebels against their and the reason for using it is clearly reluctance to recognize that though the reference may be to both sexes the right shortening of the cumbersome he or she his or her etc is he or him or his as his and him are used with a boldness surprising in a government department in there must be opportunity for the individual boy or girl to go as far as his keenness and ability will take him whether that reluctance is less felt by the male is doubtful at any rate the oed es examples from fielding everyone in the house were in their beds thackeray a person cant help their birth bagehot nobody in their senses and bernard shaw it also says nothing more severe of the use than that it is not favoured by grammarians in colloquial usage the inconvenience of having no commonsex personal pronoun in the singular has proved stronger than respect for grammarians and the one that is available in the plural is made to serve for the singular too but in prose their disfavour is not treated so lightly few good modern writers would flout them so conspicuously as fielding and thackeray did in the sentences ed or as ruskin in i am never angry with anyone unless they deserve it a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler oxford university press  p even prior to reading mr fowler i have always understood that they is a perfectly acceptable substitute for awkward constructions such as he or she or him or her or his or hers unless there is a marked requirement to be explicit about gender were it not for the selfconsciously egalitarian gender fads of the past twenty years this dead white males good judgement on the issue would be commonly understood and practiced thereby obviating the need for further eureka moments such as that above the line channelling hw fowler on meds r mullan cork 
i do use they when anything else would be difficult as in the shakespeare e but as to your other examples i do use the subjunctive and whom and so on because while i dont mind people knowing how old i am it becomes rather hard to conceal it i do mind them thinking im pigignorant every time we sacrifice one of these usages we lose scintillae of meaning that a sloppier replacement does not give us not for nothing is the subjunctive described as a mood it conveys a whole level of cognition that the indicative just cant access
you make me feel suicidal
eh she didnt say it defines the word as rabid feminist she said it defines the word with the example of rabid feminist which is perfectly acceptable of her if not of them
fair comment
finnish actually is not the same language group as hungarian only we probably lived in the same region for a very long time its just the minority complex of the hungarians that pushed them trying to find some relatives in europe you see we just took the lands of the slavs sorry about mentioning your language my bad
oh my lordy pondering what a nonbinary they is should make sleep difficult
relaxed 
viz say a man a woman and a group were involved in my altercation if they wanted to hurt me and they followed them and they took it upon themselves to get in the way of them would that be fine what if they would have caused them a great deal of harm were it not for them also so long as people are educated enough to realise that the singular pronoun used as a general pronoun is like grammatical gender in other languages would you get obsessed with the fact that a table is a she in spanish and a success is a he then there is no problem in using he or she for clarity the whole nonbinary thing is a confusion where people think that because women are not supposed to like x and i do like x then i am not a womanwhen in fact we just need to recognise that what you likedowant for your life does not define your gender
what a strange article they as a generalising third person plural is pretty much universally accepted and has been for ages there is no problem with anyone can do it if they put their mind to it for example it only sounds wrong when you know the person knows the sex of the referent so my flatmate couldnt come because theyve got a cold sounds weird as you assume the sex of the flatmate will be known
agreed ive been using they this way in songs books articles for decades on my web sites since  to get rid of gender and because i preferred the sound i disliked both he and she when we dont know dc cuke dot com

farsi as spoken in iran is a genderless language which for example uses the same pronoun for he and she and as we all know women pretty well run the show there
lets hav themself as well everywun must fend for themself
i know many people from island and other cultures the usual term is uncles amp aunts as this is a sign of respect for the elders these are the people who you can trust for advice these relationships are as tight as family gets we all could learn a lot about raising children in these tight knit communities as for those of different persuasion take the opposite gender specific
im sorry but i beg to differ these language issues really only exist in parts of western culture countries like china bn and india bn which represent almost  of the worlds population have languages that recognise the blood relationship between people and express it that way at times with subtlties that can distinguish between a maternal cousin and a paternal cousin it is naive and specious to think that just because in the west we have used procreative technologies to cloud bloodlines that it is some type of advancement or higher social evolvement that should be recognised in english
but raising awareness never hurt
i didnt read finduskeepuss post as offended at all weary rather
two issues in response to what the author has to say firstly by using the word lesbian there is not need to add the description of woman the term speaks for itself lesbianwomansecondly the issue of transsexual shouts for a huge social re think the standard e with regard to being born in the wrong body is deceptive the term relies on a stereotype of traditional concepts of gender immediately separating the human being from the essential self because of our social fixation that immediately divides at birth this splits us into male or female with all the loaded social expectations of behaviours and future rolesin other words cease adhering to such notion as being born in a body which is wrongsocial reconstruction is what is sorely required to bring about real change this is the issue to addressnew language indeed yes
im sympathetic to your situation but just because some people have a bit of awkwardness about the use of mother or father it doesnt mean that we have to change the whole language just find out what works for you or use first names thats the easiest way to solve it
trust me when youre not straight or cis any question is fair game from the people who are they take our want for privacy as a dire offence as if every part of our lives should be readily available to them just because they want to learn and somehow theyre the ones who complain that we get offended too easily
dont have a rebuttal simply claim your target is offended even though theyre clearly just expressing their opinion works every time
im not surprised why should i be
bollocks what children need is love and stability it doesnt matter if its from biological parents adoptive parents single parents two mums or two dads
if you look at semitic languages they have a bewildering array of cognatic terms some latin etc are just interested in stages removed nepos is both cousin and grandchildren two steps removed and there are often means of referring to unrelated caregivers in liverpool in the postwar preclearance years there was mam nan and nin the latter being an adult female who took a turn with child supervision in some of the tribal situations where there is a degree of polyandry they get around it by assuming partial shares in a child where the multiple relationships with the mother continue they do that by pretending to be or actually being ignorant about how conception works i doubt we can do thatprobably some tinkering with vowels will be the most likely did and dad maybe youre did didnt and your dad did
our language has been spiked by christianity and other languages are spiked with the words relating or not relating to christianity being a christian is not an original sin 
dont worry the new words will develop either re used existing ones or portmanteau orbrand new the english language has been doing this all by its self for centuries it doesnt need to be managed or workshopped or plebocited
while were at it what about auntiesalmost any adult of the right age used to qualify for this even if they were second cousins your mums school friend or even long standing neighbours or is that just common
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family this is the vast majority of most families are you out of your mind guardian
the author actually personally knows a lesbian couple who have moved their sperm donor into the house to coparent with them and two separate women who have used the same sperm donor and tell everybody thishe must move in very guardian circles the reason language to describe this doesnt exist is that the vast majority of people dont need itthe two boys whose mothers used the same sperm donor are technically half brothers but seeing as sperm donor is not called father perhaps they dont count as brothers either
im surprised that people ask such personal questions as in the report such as whose your real dad and which of you is mom
families have evolved no families have fallen apart more children than ever suffer confusing chaotic lives thanks to their liberated parents this is not the end of the world at all modern life and traditional parenting is a tough act to pull off but drop your delusions amp stop doing the substances
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family its an ageold arrangement for bringing up children and it can work beautifully i raise no objection to it oh thank you for your approval i can go about my day in peace knowing that my family has your acceptance
language is static and never changes to fit the world around us thats why shakespeare knew the terms internet cellphone and even used snowflake as an insult despite having no clue what any of them meant linguists apparently
no
we need to acknowledge that families come in multiple shapes and sizes that love is not a finite asset and that caregiving involves more than a genetic imperative yes i suppose some need to given that dna analysis has shown that a significant number of children are not biologically related to the person they consider to be their mother or father it is of considerable concern as this article from  hints at
this looks like a nonsolution in search of a nonproblem it might be handy to help this cifer sell some copies of his book but for the rest of us and society as a whole this is just creating problems rather than solving them
im not sure you can be brothers spiritually
the five percent of my genes that are neanderthal are in grunting uproar about this monoracial business
eh
there are no words because these relationships are vanishingly small in frequency and a confusion is being made between what intimates call each other and how social relations might be denominated to a wider circle both require a fit suitability usually via analogy kin relations are often fictive so that they can give a place to favoured others within the sprawling network that makes a family my favourite uncle was no blood relation even to my parents he was my fathers best friend from childhood he was uncle bobby to meanother but rather crueller way of asking the question is if it all goes tits up who carries the can for childsupport who is responsible in the final analysis who can just walk away or wider how should we as a society insist on determining what are the key relationships for the financial security of the children involved
but i think the point is that why biologically they may be related there is little to no connection there and they would not even know of this family were it not for a chance encounter theyre not brothers emotionally or spiritually and have no connection to each other so is blood the most important factor
the important thing is that children have a loving and caring parents irrespective of race gender or sexual identity that said i wonder how elton johns children will fare at school when the other children discover their father is a practising watford football club fan
it is how folk in the midlands refer to their mothers
spiteful showing or caused by malice since language is clearly important to the author of this piece and i assume to you can you explain how his comment was caused by malice rather than humour
perhaps just use the old words approximately as in the nephews of popes and the companions who lived with my elderly cborn aunts why are usians are so terribly literalminded its as if they were all operating in their second language
oh dear what would you have found to get offended by if he hadnt put that line in
my bio boy calls me by my first name even though i prefer dad
our language has been spiked by christianity to describe the world as the bible sees it rather than as it is or as we might want it to be language affects how we think about things and how we can think about things it is the original newspeak think about gay marriage we still have a wife or a husband no matter that were both the same sex even though these terms are gendered and inherently comparative a husband implies a wife not another husband for example things that dont have words sound like aberrations perversions as soon as things have words they become normalised and understandable its like having a mysterious set of symptoms diagnosed as a particular condition the relief and sense of understanding when the thing has a name any familial relationship that requires a description sounds wrong and i think that was deliberate its not been long that legitimate and illegitimate children were labelled by their parents sin so good luck trying to find words for antimonotheistic perversions and having them accepted by wider society the tide at the moment seems to be flowing very much in the other direction
a friend who is bringing up a child as a single mother has met someone who used the same sperm donor she did they are not close friends are those two womens children to call themselves brothers if not then what doesnt this describe any second marriage that ends up with children they are called half brothers
language will evolve when theres a societal need for it to this of course true which in a sense invalidates at least part of the articles purpose look for instance at the mrsmiss vs mr problem to which a solution was contrived years ago ms that has only partially caught on not least because of pronunciation issues and there could be said to be a far wider need for it than terms to describe complex but relatively rare relationships such as those described in the article exactly why languages dont all label things using the same boundaries is far from clear youd expect for instance that germanic languages like norwegian and swedish so closely related historically to english and sharing a lot of basic vocabulary roots to name family relationships in a parallel way but they dosnt quite for us grandmother and grandfather can be on either parental side yet we obviously dont think we need separate terms to differentiate the north germanic languages on the other hand have both a generic term bestemor bestefar and specific terms farmor mormor farfar morfar interesting to know howwhenwhy this differentiation developed 
if the children simply use the adults names there should be far less confusion all round
and how does it work i assume youre the preeminent mind in the field of linguistics so please tell us all how language really works
thats irrelevant whether my father was a good or bad parent i am still obliged to carry his biological material in me just a plain fact
yes i am grateful for his approval of how the overwhelming majority of humankind construct their families
thats not tyranny at all tyranny is where power is consciously exercised not a ruling by nature what you are describing is just unfortunate
yeahbut they dont have ipads either
common here in midlands also
because we were his idea hes our real dad his yearold daughter explained to me but what are they to call those other three people each of whom is involved to a degree in their upbringing shareholders surely and according to how much the various parties paid towards the creation presumably in professional surrogates womb and maintennance of the human asset
the g just loves to wag its finger at us
so he asked a close friend to be the sperm donor the niece of another friend to be the egg donor and a third person to be the surrogate through this unlikely calculus the four of them produced children in this case production on the hivinfected persons behalf is a bit of stretch of the word
outliers tend not to get generic terms
how do you call a petri dish in which a zygote is conceived during ivf for instance parental rights for the petri dish too
why do so many articles articles in this newspaper insist on telling us what must happen and what people must do and what society must do do we really want a society where we are told what must do and what must happen what are the commonly used words in the english language for those societies i wonder
yes its the us variant of mum youre welcome
its the authors bid to win the guardian manufactured social justice outrages accumulator for today
you understand that your claim addresses the minority while the authors broad sweeping statement makes no such distinction but suggests it as a general rule
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family its an ageold arrangement for bringing up children and it can work beautifully im so relieved that i almost wept
im glad im not the only one paying attention on this
exactly there is nothing offensive or snowflake like about the authors line seems the people accusing others of snowflakery are the ones seeking something to get butthurt about
good point
it is not the only method that can work beautifully that has yet to be proven changing language is putting the cart before the horse in an attempt to change established ideas of the family time will tell in the meantime experiment continues
ok how many is it samesex couples are covered we already have mother and father little problem with aunts uncles cousins how many families could possibly be left out with the terminology that currently exists
actually it is a tyranny in terms of the respect afforded to biological parents as opposed to anyone else there are many people who have biological children who should never have had kids and many people who cannot have kids who would be great parents or do you deny this fact
thats likely because one of them has no biological relationship with the child neither do adoptive parents but they have full legal claims to parenthood i dont think that was the point
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family yeah we dont need you to tell us that
it would be interesting to look at other cultures and how they refer to other primary adults when bringing up children there must be patterns and norms where you have communities and tribes where multiple people bring up kids we have accept and embrace that the world alters over time though the idea that a nuclear one mum amp one dad family is the only way is clearly not the case just look at our nearest cousins the primates
as much as i dont necessarily personally subscribe to the use of nonbinary hisher pronouns at least the trans community has given this some thought and we have evolved language here the author is requesting language change without specifying how or in what form i accept the premise that explaining yourself must be annoying but we already have lots of words to denote responsibility for children for example
hold on you said monoracial near the end now theres a whole can of worms almost suggests that the standard words for family connections cannot be applied when people arent of the same race now thats the wierdest strawman ive ever seen or just a word thrown in to make the sentence cooler
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness or lament over the wasted genetic material manifested in statements like this
i think youd be surprised at the numbers of families that are not described accurately by traditional language on the other hand i will grant that using traditional language does provide a cover of privacy particularly for young children
avoid doubles tennis at all costs it will seriously piss you off
a new word for every different kind of connection perhaps just use the old words approximately remember some of these things have existed for centuries with death and people having to work away the  parent nuclear family wasnt everyones experience in previous centuries
comments on the other article on gendered language are not open but this one is sufficiently close that i hope i can get away with an apology for being slightly offtopic the article hailed the use of they as a genderneutral singular pronoun as a new development however it is actually far more interesting than that the singular they was routine in english up until the nineteenth century there was then a concerted movement by grammarians to replace it for genderambiguous usage with he they felt it was natural to prioritise the male word as i believe is common in some other european languages somewhere in the earlymid twentieth century it was decided that thats a bit sexist and they tried to replace it with the rather clunky construct he or she as the clumsiness of that has become apparent weve finally come full circle back to they which never quite died out through that period
thats a relief aint it
when a lesbian woman i know asked a friend to be sperm donor for her and her wife he said he wasnt interested in being a donor but would love to be a father now the three of them live together and all three identify as the childs parents it seems to have confused the schools a great deal and one of them still lacks a full legal claim to parenthood thats likely because one of them has no biological relationship with the child
its best to get your offense in early in fact its probably best just to assume everyone is offended until you hear otherwise
yes
sorry but im already offended
how can anyone suppose that i am more of a real father than my husband is and how can anyone presume that he is more related to the children for whom he was a sperm donor than to the one in our household for whom he has cared since birth when people speak in these terms they are speaking of biological relation thats how they can suppose it you can broaden father and relation to encompass more than biological relatedness but in effect it doesnt change anything people will still suppose you are more of a biological father than your husband is because you objectively are and he objectively is not they will still presume that he is more biologically related to the children for whom he was a sperm donor because objectively he is
is mom a word
oh dear really making hard work of something that neednt be many irishspeaking families traditionally called their parents by their first names and used their community namenickname sean ard tall sean outside the family circle surnames are not very useful when everyone in the same district happens to share the same family name o tuama for example the great advantage of being known by a name is that you are known primarily as a person rather than as a relation this allows you all the freedom to have as complex a set of relationships as you wish without tying yourself up in knots
as a snowflake should i be offended by that
wouldnt worry about it
hell never write for the guardian again
getting a bit oversensitive there arent you the guys only communicating that hes not attacking or demeaning the main structure in which people parent probably to preempt the line of attack that his family is undermining society was it necessary to contribute this spiteful sneer
you choose then post a list of approved terms and dont forget to tell us when one of them suddenly becomes offensive we wouldnt want a twitter meltdown
sorry but this really isnt how language works
i think this is a guardian usa contribution theyre a little behind culturally
whilst i have sympathy with the fact it must be annoying answering the same questions over again despite some of the answers being obvious i think this is simply a function of you being in the minority in terms of your family for the vast vast majority of families in the country the language used to describe them is perfectly expansive and doesnt require any evolution of language language will evolve when theres a societal need for it to and not merely because someone in a minority position is tired of slightly ignorant questions the traditional words exist because they work in the context of the majority of people
it can work beautifully careful you could be in trouble for saying that what does michael gove think
well thats silly of you words often have more than one meaning
i get really pissed off when people refer to us as partners we are in a marriage not a business
truly the guardian never disappoints
maybe we could have a new phrase meaning tail wagging the dog
language evolves according to need if the terms you describe havent fully evolved yet its because not many people need them
its difficult i think the reason language hasnt kept up as it has with computers is that computers are ubiquitous unlike gay adoption and trans
you mean he is to use nonpc language a cretin
interesting though that you are all fired up to attack me and defend the guy who wants to call black people niggers women cunts etc ill remind you that my crime was to use the word talentless in the same sentence as gary oldmans name
gary oldman and his ilk are a disgrace i have never liked him as an actor and long ago gave up on gibson both are totally narcisstic their miserable opinions of no consequence to me
try reporting it to the guardians readers editor
no justice no peace that sort of thing
no if you bothered to read my comment you would see that i suggested a casual prejudiced insult that any one of us might throw oldmans way if we met him in order to demonstrate to him how wrong such insults are the thing about prejudice is that it is rarely if ever based on fact there does that help
they were both wrong
i like lenny and gary but your comparison is entirely bogus
well the point here isnt whether or not hes talentless is it though you made a point of saying he is talentless
maybe the fight back against pc has something to do with it becoming a subtle form of censorship by being quick to castigate and label people as racists and bigots because they happen to be critical of certain religiouscultural practices far better to have total freedom of speech with the usual exception of those who use it to threaten others then the real bigots can be brought out into the open and challengedof course this is harder work than imposing uniform pc on everyoneit requires effort and a willingness to publicly stand up and be counted
i think youll find people are less bigoted than you believe dont push that line too far or half the guardians columnists will be out of work
you miss the point again
with respect mark thats just your opinion and you know what they say about opinions the difference is that lennys opinion is politically approved by our current rulers despite the institutional racism infesting britain that we hear so much about
you seem to think that the left is one homogenous mass it isnt as a left wing atheist i have no desire whatever to defend religious beliefs or other irrational nonsense i regard fundamentalist christianity islam and judaism as all being on the far right in fact its often difficult to distinguish between them and between them and the far right of the edl or bnp so similar are their views on all manner of things including homosexuality womens rights minority rights etc
he could play adolf hitler hed be jolly good
the trouble is that children are not generally brought up to be polite now that is children of any race or section of society they are brought up with their rights but not the rights of others to be left alone
the idea that the antipc brigade have won and many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please is like the flipside of the daily mails assertion that the pc brigade have won and you cant say anything any more the guardian and the mail are increasingly mirrorimages of each other reversed left to right and right to left
ok heres another real example my flatmate couldnt come theyve got a cold
you read my mind
well the point here isnt whether or not hes talentless is it the point is gary oldmans defence of obnoxiously insulting behaviour towards innocent people please feel free to choose your own insult when you see him
but mark you love bigotry when it comes out in the form of sincerely held religious beliefs especially one particular religion ive seen you vehemently condemn those who challenge said bigotry as being bigots
nil by mouth was brilliant and all about confusion the use of ego and our unequal skills we use to combat it usually to our detriment that is why it is brilliant
yes yes i have those are word for word es from the interview i of course removed language that the blogger is allowed to use above but would see my comment deleted for community standards
the objection to the word negro seems to have largely originated with malcom x and the black muslim movement so it would not seem to be racists who changed the meaning of the term unless you regard malcolm x and the black muslims to themselves be racist
but its incongruous that she should so relentlessly attack white british when it is they who created the country in which she prefers to live and isnt that the heart of so much of the anger having built the country so many others want to get into they then start pissing on it after they get into it
there are valid arguments against immigration there are valid worries about islamic influence in the uk there are valid arguments about all sorts of things but where the right gets it wrong is in its delusional belief that these things are either worse than they are or are causing all our ills and usually these delusions are peddled by politicians and media moguls who are completely unaffected by these issues but who are interested in control and manipulation of the population much of it is smoke and mirrors a distraction from real problems and the real reasons for these problemsit is the capitalist system itself ironically which needs immigration and emigration which creates these inequalities and crazy surpluses such as immigration can lead to or crazy shortages whilst working class people are the ones primarily suffering nothing is going to be done about any of it it doesnt make a difference whether you think of yourself as right wing or left wing the entire system is there for the benefit of the few and they are doing better than ever do you think that if they werent benefitting theres really be such high levels of immigration do you really think they are helpless and cant do anything about it either way no
well ive been the recipient of those so i am aware of it when was the last time you tried suggesting that perhaps all this immigration of the last  years mightnt have been such a good idea for the people already here did you read labours attempts to backtrack on this topic and allow as how they shouldnt have always taken and i e their language again the politically correct line on immigration why do you think they were afraid to do anything else for so long and only started acknowledging the issue when they started losing voters to ukip i never suggested that the pc brigade were solely responsible for the rise of ukip but let me tell you the pc brigades insistence on calling anyone a racist who believes that the pace was way too high and too fast and that a cohesive culture as may be seen by what denmark achieved with one can be an advantage most certainly gave them a leg up as did labours pc refusal to question those levels and that pace until they started losing voters to ukip i rather despise ukip myself but in one sense you have to give them credit they forced the establishment parties finally to pay attention to the voter blocs theyd ignored for half a century
jargon free messageit is those who can do those who cant teach and those who cant do either who become bossy marxist theorists who try to control free speech
i meant one that talks about something of interest to me re your comment this made me laughwhere got a link cos otherwise ill have to keep reading this one im going to use that in future with your permission or without and pass it off as my own
easy gary was wrong lenny is right
if someone is angry and the first thing they yell is a racial slur then that probably does say something about them they didnt choose something race neutral like asshole or shithead but went for the racial slur
mugs us with ham in his films and plays chicken when his secret is out
political correctness is basically just cultural marxism the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms and this is just the start of a one way trip to hell were all going to move in to your area and open bicycle shops and vegetarian restaurants
agreed with your articleyou left the reader with question quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum youre losing some people because articles like this are so numerous it can begin to sound like a witch hunt rather than a balanced debateif the media constantly tells people theyre sexistracisthomophobicetc some of the innocent will feel guilty and the guilty will not caresmall wonder the innocent feel victimisedexpect them to kick backperhaps its time for the conversation to evolvetreat it more as multicultural issueif the media dont find the right balance i expect youll be writing a lot more articles like this one
sorry i meant difference precludes equality i am obviously inferior in the use of predictive text but did i do it on purpose to get all you pro equality s to laugh at my inferiority
if you think hes talentless then im not sure you know what talent is as an actor hes been slagged off by total strangers all the time
sunshine take a femtosecond to look at my posts and youll see that i like to say that organised religion can get to fuck if you think self respect and respect for others is mealy mouthed i wish you all the luck in getting any
pc language has always been nothing more than a middle class veneer all people behave well and badly bad people have good moments and good people have bad moments most of us have a good idea of what is polite and what is not sometimes politeness can be an inappropriate response politeness should be our aim but having monitors around to catch people out is entirely counterproductive it reminds me of mary whitehouse counting bare breasts and swear words on bbc tv in the s it is akin to applying primary school teaching techniques to adults
id be happier knowing who were the bigots around me shutting them up means i could be helping some prick achieve promotion
hes an actor so i dont care what he says unless theres credits after it
what on earth is equality anyway recognition of difference precludes inequality a truth at the core of human existence and the technological progress of humanity where does it exist in opportunity no in material distribution no can anyone send me an example i cant dismiss in a sentence please try i would be so happy to be wrong
gary is an actor who emerged from a tough upbringing in the white working class he has expressed an opinion that many who have a similar background will recognise he is attacked and condemned lenny is an actor who emerged from the black working class he expressed an opinion that many who have a similar background will recognise he is lionised and summoned to parliament to share his opinion spot the difference
im sorry that you are speechless but back in the s and s my parents and most people i knew would use the word negro as a completely nonderogatory way of describing black people after all if the word was good enough for martin luther king it was good enough for my parents
i cant understand why youre hung up on the left about this the whole pc thing came from the centre right in the usa in the eighties i dont consider new labour left wing at all again they are to the right of centre and are pretty much responsible for what we would see as pc in the uk today yes there is left wing pc but it doesnt influence established pc to the extent that you might believe but there is right wing political correctness too criticise the royal family criticise our troops criticize israel criticise saudi arabia then feel the wrath of the right
that is someone who has never used a racist word in their life may well get drunk one day and get into an altercation in that altercation they may not use pc language im sorry i dont agree with you we were just talking about this yesterday these offensive words the n word p word et cetera are used by people who have them in their active vocabulary these are words they use either in private or in their thoughts ie they probably think that black people are abhorrent or gay people are filth and so on when they mistakenly say these words in public or when drunk as you say they have just temporarily lost their inhibitions and when they apologise they do so not because they are sorry but because they have been caught it has never occurred to me to use the horrible words and i have been drunk a lot during my life hic i know many many many people who are the same
nil by mouth was a little confused but still brilliant cathy burke was excellent and ray winston hadnt become a parody of himself so was perfect for his role i also liked state of grace very much with sean penn most of his other films are entertaining at the very least and many are extremely good im a bit of a fan as it goes
these articles always reminds me of a sniveling child stamping hisher feet life is not fair he said something i didnt like i have to say this author doesnt see to have any sense of selfawareness or humour at all the fact is that life is not fair nor is it equal nor has it ever been this obsession with perfect equality policing the language seems to make people very unhappy yes there should be laws if people are harming people and everyone should be treated equally no minorities shouldnt be prioritised because this is orwellian and leads to some animals being more equal than others and all political movements for equality have been grassroots driven theyve hardly been conducted by a centralised body policing everything people say this always leads to problems with totalitarian societies emerging the road to hell etc no we need an open society where dumb ideas get exposed for what they are dumb and they can be laughed out the law should be applied equally and not police what people thinksay in bar i think youll find people are less bigoted than you believe
i wouldnt say that it isnt used towards women at all but rather that its genderneutral
perhaps any one of us who has the misfortune of encountering gary oldman in person now or at any time in the future could take the opportunity to tell him he is a miserable talentless fucking prick then maybe he can see how it feels routinely to be on the receiving end of thoughtless and prejudiced personal epithets
i love pc it makes bigots have to watch their fucking mouths
i havent only read this article
if the notion pc is just politeness is correct why does the left feel the need to use the prosecutory power of the state to impose politeness and criminalise the impolite greeting someone with a good morning is polite but it would be absurd to criminalise non adherence i agree that using terms that other people do not like is boorish and crass however criminalising those who do not conform to your worldview is just another example of the intrinsic illiberalism of the contemporary left
right and ct just happens to refer to the anatomy of women a group almost universally held in secondclass status in the world until the last few decades we continue to have religions openly teaching women are temptresses who can be justly beaten if disobedient and refusing to cover ourselves but you see no problems does is really go over your head that a significant portion of male jibes directed at other men involving calling someone a woman or gay man also americans constitute the majority of native speakers of english so writing them off as some peculiarity is a pretty weak argument
good to see you stoop to his level any thoughts on yabs idiotic rant at liddle which started all this
when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots in the heat of the moment i might call someone a cunt or a prick but even when drunk id never call them a nigger cunt or faggot prick as i am neither racist nor homophobic and i believe that someone who uses this kind of language is often your true nature come out when either drunk or angry or both
you might add that theyre a bit late on that one though at least theyve got somewhere but who can doubt that many doctors teachers social workers etc failed to report fgm suspicions because they didnt want to be accused of islamophobiaracismbeing unpc etc
really its an age old tactic derived from the military blitzkrieg overkill scorched earth you make a massively overwhelming attack on your enemy not only to defeat them immediately but perhaps more to the point to show others that they will get the same treatment if they piss you off the message is loud and clear no criticism is to be permitted against certain quarters oldman really shouldve known this and despite his apology he is going to learn this lesson brutally his career is pretty much over
i agree with you about manners the difficulty arises when one tries to suggest that immigration controls might help in reducing some of the tensions emerging in our society one is immediately racist to suggest a reasonable level of english literacy amongst immigrant labour as a sensible requirement racist question the wisdom of collaborating with the increasing influence of islamic ideas in britain phobic questioning abortion homosexuality re defining marriage all place one outside the approved circle of respectable opinion this suppresses debate and creates a false concensus like any attempt at suppressing opinion it cannot succeed for long
cultural marxism is not a thing the first time most people even heard the phrase was in the ravings written by anders breivik
pc used to suggest polite and courteous it has evolved into a paradigm that can close discussion down there is an apocryphal story about a ny official being disciplined for using the word niggardly whether true or not it illustrates a trend as seen by the appearance of the n word phrase
they stole our jobs
the rather more sinister side is that championed by many on the liberalleft spectrum do you have any names or is this just to remain a general slur on left wing people
i agree
good article where got a link cos otherwise ill have to keep reading this one and its deathless prose who will cease to carve lines such as the right has consistently trounced political correctness on their hearts
if only gary oldman could be as polite as me
what on earth has bravery got to do with it
yes that was wrong and youre not grasping what im saying at all thornbrush
if politicians were influenced by the majority culture then we would never have had the race relations act the decriminalisation of homosexuality or the abolition of hanging brought in in the s politicians use power to change culture this is what has happened in recent decades its how thatcher succeeded in demolishing the post war concensus we have an elective dictatorship many of the changes enacted in our national life were never announced in advance they legislated whilst in power without mentioning the impending changes in party manifestoes the political class has cleverly bolted some leftist shibboleths on to neo liberalism to create the current politico cultural settlementthe strains are showing because the resulting inequalities are less and less manageable and human nature and group identities cannot be legislated away peacefully
youre possibly not the best person to advance the case
im a lefty and im no pacifist many on the left are deeply wary of political correctness and its abuse
get over it oldman is only an actor all this angst is laughable
last week mp michael fabricant joked about punching the commentator yasmin alibhaibrown the following night on channel  news the journalist james delingpole referring to a woman well into her sixties as a girl found it astonishing that alibhaibrown had turned a tweet that was mildly unflattering into a threat indeed to view such comments as condoning violence against women was beyond the pale the premise is the same political correctness has gone mad and no one can say anything any more and about a month ago yasmin alibhaibrown when writing about sally wainwright complained that wainwright used to be feminist and is now postfeminist this angered yab so much tha it to deliberately lift her words out of context nuance and full obvious meaning regardless of the possible brutal interpretation which could be focused on via a strictly literal reading of y abs words made her want  to bang her head against a wall thats alibhaibrown smashing wainwrights head against a wall btw so please dont use the aggressive sly manipulative disingenuous provocative yab as some innocent victim to further whatever point it was you were ultimately trying to make shes as good bad or whatever as fabricant or lots of other people a wordsmith gameplayer personally id say worse as shes also adept at playing the  oh woe be me im such a poor innocent victim card when her aggressive onslaughts just dont cut it others would agree others wouldnt
gary oldman is younger than gary numan and yet still not a pilot go figure
in my humble opinion the word ct is just as acceptable as fuck prick cock arsehole and shit it is a curse word for a part of the anatomy that has taken on separate meanings for when you want to insult someone im conscious that in the usa the word seems used exclusively towards women in the uk its quite the opposite and isnt used towards women at all its just a rude word that you call someone when youre pissed off at them
what about the bbc panic over the playing of the sun has gots his hat on on radio devon
the thing is in day to day life ct is orders of magnitude more acceptable than nr the former will not get you tossed from the pub or have old ladies remarking on how soandso is racist worse misogyny the oldest and most widespread prejudice is actively abated by the leftist who demand that we respect religion on another topic most of the worst antisemities have become very adept a cloaking their bigotry with obsessive hyperbolic denunciations of israel saying israeli money instead of jewish money is perfectly acceptable when they do slip up and say jewish like american defence secretary chuck hagel the supposedly pc left will defend them aggressively as we saw during his confirmation process
negro was a name given to black people by spanish speakers the term was then used in the us in segregation along with nigger negro became a term with negative connotations racists would be to blame for changing the meaning of the term so why shouldnt black people now condemn the term nigger was originally a neutral term for black people and came from the latin word for black i doubt you would want to use that word either so you recognise that words can change meaning and context over time
its not about what you can say in a social sense its about where the state gets involved even in supposedly less enlightened times plenty of people would think you were a prat for saying the sort of things oldman refers to but they didnt assume their offense or objection entitled them to some kind of legal redress recently a woman who was called a moaning little slag in a text from a salesman called the police called the police
if a lefty does it its  revolutionary justice as self defence is no offence
that this guy thinks the tories and new labour are radical left is chilling just how far to the right do you have to be to be thinking that type of wild shit
having enough self respect to respect others this is one of those mealymouthed statements that begs the question of tolerating intolerance most political correctness is about preventing racism and more recently homophobia misogyny comes dead last i have more protection as a lesbian than as a woman this is particularly exacerbated by the likes of you rushing to respect religion
my thoughts exactly the problem is that the far right dont recognize that those slightly to their left arent actually left wing its right wing delusion gorn mad i tell ye
that question isnt relevant to my point i was address what cultural marxism means not saying who should define what culture is
since the left is not in power in any of these places how did it manage to ban such words and phrases
however its quite likely at that time that your parents would use words like negro or coloured coloured possibly but thats how black people in the states at the time described themselves but negro im actually insulted that you could think that about my parents why would you im speechless
its enough for most of us that we dont make a point of offending others it always frightens me to see a fellow lgbt person think this way the mythical right to not be offended is a reactionary notion that belies your progressive rhetoric but that mentality is emblematic of how the same left that once championed free speech and artistic freedom became their stalwart enemies with blinding speed once in power
your comment is the closest to what ive been trying to get across theres pc and theres pc there is no consensus on what it is and therefore it is all sorts of things at all sorts of different times and in different places ludicrous scare stories run by the likes of the daily mail and other right wing rags such as the lie that baa baa black sheep was banned somewhere are designed to undermine the best intentions of pc but then there is right wing pc and there are examples of good intentions gone very much awry such as some nursery schools really banning the aforementioned rhyme because they believed the tabloid lie
does anyone ever threaten to punch your lights out and thats pc is it
most unsanitary
he did and hes a gobshite
so to sum up pc gone mad is a vile censorship and this article that says something i dont like shouldnt have been printed yeah go brave freedom fighters
ahh a m g in the making appalling
but pc isnt just about such pejorative terms which are indeed unacceptable it has become a monster and is often used or really misused by people who either dont understand what it is or who want to stifle debate
as others have pointed out lola tells the story out of context is there a limit that we should accept for this sort of writing
i still wince when i think about it i was wrong to say it but id had enough of dealing with teenagers who were only in college to collect their ema and ensure their families continued to collect child allowance that particular lad my target was racist a bully loud dim and a liar just before an open evening he asked that we didnt discuss his mixed martial arts proficiency which hed told us so much about with his parents
that joke would work better if i were asking for an apostrophe to be deleted but id like one to be inserted
hes old enough to know that its polite to credit the simpsons with that obervation
apostrophobe
i had to suffer the indignity of having to explain to her exactly what i meant by it no offense but so what this is what the supposed censorship of political correctness actually amounts to its nothing sometimes in life you will be misunderstood and have to explain what you meant it happens and its not confined to political subjects
one has to ask oneself why one has to live in fear of teenagers their hearts may be in the right places but they lack the wisdom to make effective judgments they tend to see things only in black and white id ask this particular person to improve her knowledge of english get off the phone for a spell and read more books a deeper understanding of language would show her that the term gay wasnt always used as an euphemism for homosexual and furthermore until recently when the homosexual community finally got into have had enough and not going to take it anymore mode it was actually a pejorative
totally agree with toilet cleaner tens of thousands of white americans are now poor and addicted to opioids life expectancy is plummeting in some counties oppression by group identity is an overtidy idea which is really taken too seriously
it is amazing that acticmvists who insist that others use the right word cant get it straight themselves wanting to prohibit illegal aliens from entering the country without legal permission is not racism it is nationalism if anything making fun of irish and potatoes is not racist if my is ethnicist excluding muslims josef islam aka cat stevens from entering the country would be religious although no one has the focus to create the word activists want words that have punch that can end all discussion by verbally bludgeoning their opponents nothing else works like racist bigot and the ubiquitous f word so everyone tgey disagree with is bigoted racist and or fd thus activist arguments have a lot in common with the latter writings of theodore giesel they have a vocabulary of  words or less as for a preschooler one verbal activist on a popular forum uses that exact type of argument and calls himself samiam  why because disagreeing with him makes one a bigot like the character who declined sams offer of green eggs and ham without having tried them first there is no discussion either one agrees with sam or sam decrees him to be a reprobate and that settles the matter such is a politic discussion with the left
may i suggest you avoid stewart lees articles probably not for you
depends not a hill of has beens
while that may be true a wide shared vocabulary allows for subtlety and precision in speech sometimes its not worthwhile i dont very much care whether a big lorry or a humungous lorry is heading for me very fast but a diminishing vocabulary is in my opinion a symptom of a lack of appreciation for the simple things in life itll do is far too common these days

i once used the word immigrant in its true meaning that of someobody who leaves their home country for whatever reason to come and live in the uk my manager looked at me askance for using that word and i had to suffer the indignity of having to explain to her exactly what i meant by it this shouldnt be necessary words should be used appropriately as per their dictionary explanation we should not allow random people to attach negative connotations to what is simply a valid word in the english languageit may seem a trivial issue but people can be disciplined at work if somebody takes exception to a word they use and of course the social justice warriors are ever on the alert to police everyones language and find racists under every bed

i maintain that remain would have won if it had not chosen such an idiotic passive emotionless word for its stance didnt the electoral commission choose the words remain and leave for the ballot paper being supposedly the most neutral way of expressing the electorates dilemma of course the remain campaign could have chosen a different word but they would have had to accompany it with the word remain in their advertising anyway so that people knew what they were being asked to vote for i look at the new language of the corbyn crew melts slugs gammon and see a discourse of contempt too much to ask that you get through an article without an irrelevant jibe at corbyn supporters no evidence has ever been presented that corbyn supporters are more liable to abuse their opponents than may supporters or blair supporters but the media with their anticorbyn bias need no evidence
im a bit concerned that the hairtrigger response to slights real or imagined is forcing us into a form of newspeak where our ideas are constrained by our language this like the newspeak of  only affects the masses the manipulators not being bound by such constraints are free to drive the masses like a herd of horses

the wisdom of the heart having no concern with the erection or demolition of theories any more than with the defence of prejudices has no random words at its command the words it pronounces have the value of acts of integrity tolerance and compassion conrad nostromo words which dont just come from another time but almost from another language

i have since very young believed strongly that we each have a moral responsibility to do as we would be done by i know this is a christian way of expressing the idea but i believe the idea transcends christianity i am not a christian but i believe christ was a pretty wise guy i only wish christians especially redneck americans were more christiannondisabled heterosexual white males have been dominant for a long time disabled people have a problem with thisnonheterosexual people have a problem with thisnonwhites have a problem with thiswomen have a problem with thisbut i it seems to me that dividing the problem into many small campaignsgroups is a kind of self inflicted divide and conquer that makes it easier for the nondisabled heterosexual white males to maintain their hegemonyi should probably add that as a nondisabled heterosexual white male my opinion is irrelevant
it does seem entirely reasonable to me that a journalist values words indeed it would otherwise be most odd words come in all shapes and sizes and are not just confined to those who live by them their beauty lies in their availability to all to twist and turn in whatever way they wish communication is owned by no class and belongs to all yodelayeedee oh durdle dee
corbyn crew whats up been told youre not criticisng jeremy enough got to shoehorn him in to a piece about language
based on my own experience of schools you are probably so hypercareful about what you say that they never have an opportunity to be offended only a truly impulsive or reckless teacher would dare say anything which could remotely be conceived as racist sexist or homophobic despite all the claims that we live in a patriarchy syllabuses were rewritten decades ago to make them more inclusive of the cultural issues of the left
puts me in mind of an exchange with my friends two kids walking home from schoolboy what does wanker meanme where did you hear thatboy someone at school called me itme well it means someone who plays with their willysmall sister well he was right then wasnt he
the touchy bastards
as an individual who partakes in male masturbation i am deeply offended by your use of the word wanker you are shaming my sexuality and creating a stigma around the perfectly normal act of exercising ones wrist check your privilege

misunderstood you then
erm quite its an immunology metaphor however her online friends are already absolutely cynical and dismissive of it all which i dont expect to be common on this side of the pond
zippy you dont have a teenager do you of course shes taking the piss and of course suzanne well knows that shes not taking the mickey though cos that might be racist too
thats what i calls em while listening to the doobie bros

one just wishes some other people would have that attitude
people now impute the most vile motives onto everyone based on no solid evidence for example if black people do not win an award the academy must be racist white supremacists the selfcensorship which stems from this is real i read an article recently about when wsmerwin a renowned american poet was awarded a  lifetime achievement award i mean here we had a poet who had won the pulitzer twice the judges discussed in the article how they agonized about giving it to him because they thought it would be viewed as white men giving an award to white men i would argue that in this culture awards of any kind are almost meaningless as people will just assume you are biased or partisan i simply do not believe that this is what liberation looks like we are not supposedly be divided into mutually suspicious camps all looking over our shoulders afraid of being called out
im  but identify as 
which why in your first sentence you should have said identity with not identify as oh dear
isnt woke part of an aspect of american culture its not a term that originated here
sums up teenagers and their prissy the world hates me mentality still weve all been there and got over ourselves eventually
i have a teenager who appears to be mainlining american culture and so is entirely immune if not allergic to all this woke stuff as someone you might all see as a grumpy old right winger actually just an evil libdem im quite embarrassed by the the level she appears to be rejecting it all
most teens prefer american english nowadays
we have forgotten the principle of charity where speech is concerned i would hope most people can spot the difference between malice and error yelling at someone for using an outdatedincorrect term is not going to achieve what the yeller hopes for
why do people keep saying that this is the age of being offended by everything and keep on insisting of lack of free speech i dont think my parents or even before them my grandparents had as much right as a free opinion as we have now in any case we are all more opinionated now than ever if anyone feels offended is because they are allowed to do that while in past times you will have to shut up if you didnt want to get into trouble
it makes my occasional crewing as a kid sound a lot cooler than it actually was although sailing is pretty cool too

this is not a rant about political correctness which to me is basically good manners its fine to ask people what they want to be called and correct to call them that but language is changing very fast the divide now is not merely between generations but through tertiary education not just now it has been so for a long time i recall an article by deborah orr in which she mentioned going back home from university and upbraiding her parents for referring to the corner shop as the paki shop they could not understand what all the fuss was about as they clearly did not mean the term in any derogatory sense like you i believe that political correctness is primarily a matter of politeness but intentions matter in the discourse of politeness as opposed to the discourse of etiquette which is all about demonstrating that you are an insider by your intricate knowledge of minutiae there is something very sad if defenders of political correctness among whom i count myself make no attempt to infer intent and bring no generosity of spirit in inferring it but insist on a punctilious observance of form i feel that it completely defeats the whole point of political correctness which was to create an environment that demeaned and excluded no one
how old are you
sure as long as you dont get offended if i forget 
i dont think its a hardship to refer to others how they prefer to be referred to moot point or are you quite happy to refer to me as sire from now on
the teenagers i teach well try to teach after physically prying their mobiles out of their hands rarely get offended by anything they spend most of their time taking selfies and listening to kendrick lamar i wish they would get upset about gay rights or something it would make a change from the usual apathy
best just stick to the queens english they say inverness is the best place to learn it and the house of commons the best place to unlearn it that way you will be understood by all and can get a job if youre a man at the bbc paying a billion a year plus expenses
stick around youll get so old you no longer give a monkeys
 so where does asexual live in the acronym lgbtqipo 
yeah that bloody craft beer taking our jobs houses and benefits
i wouldnt put all language development down the idea of some overly sensitive younger generation language evolves and what is and isnt socially acceptable changes in what manner did you use gay when i was a teenager it was used as an insult i still know lots of adults who use it in that way and even though they may not intentionally be trying to make a derogatory reference to those who are gay it can sound that way in the same way my grandparents used what would now be considered appallingly racist language or my parents used pretty homophobic language things just move on when i said thats a lot of potatoes she called me racist because she is half irish are you sure she isnt taking the piss
i imagine that everyone in the maritime world has just scowled in your direction
they and the possessive their work perfectly well for that its not really a problem
next this guy david shariatmadari will reap another headline that says calling someone an asshole reveals the evil heart of the english language as an example of extreme prejudice against pederasts what the man does not understand is that language evolves both with niceties and pejoratives every language has strengths and weaknesses for example mandarin chinese does not distinguish gender directly the transliteration is ta singular for both men and women it is usage and context that determines in english whether one is sexist or racist or whatever not the word per se
mind you dont lose your brain whilst you sat on the shitter
you ever see that in a dictionary
careful youll give the left ideas you do realise that the post was ing orwell and you do know which side of the political spectrum orwell was on dont you
see the second last paragraphwhats missing though is the reason for this are we blaming men women can be rather critical of each other surely both men and women contribute to language development through usage
ginster a female with a liking for cornish pasties
oh come on i bet you could well i bet i could anyway
interesting how you couldnt find any examples that didnt go out of use in the s  manages to corroborate davids thesis there so neatly corroborate this is an oldish word so i better explain it means to confirm or to veryfy and the many recommendations you got take this corroboration one step furtherneat
if as the sub editor has it that sexism is at the heart of the english language the heart mark you surely its incumbent on the guardian publishers to begin to use another nonsexist language otherwise by speaking and writing english the guardian will be sexist itself has esperantos time finally come is come sexist 
the point made in the article is that these words do have male equivalents and the male equivalents are considered positive master courtier etc
had trouble with the gardening yesterday should have used a ho
the moro islamic liberation front
i dont know why youre ranting at me i agree its horrible how language and society in general treated women historically and still does in some cases
nope i didnt suggest that and never would i know it just popped in there and my brain just sort of ran with it actually started to think about computer enabled metacommunications in which comments are translated on the fly and passed between systems as tokens like ltculturally appropriate honorificgt ltinformal addressgt and ltminor insultgt
excellently put
no you just use they gender neutral i refuse to be an it
implicit violence in language cute has cut in it far more is the intonation behind the words you say men hit women not because of the words we use in everyday conversation women become whores while men become stags with regards to promiscuity because of culture and not the word the word reflects society it doesnt drive it the left ideology is to control words and thereby hope to control the way people think ie ban some words redefine others with the ideology that this will force society to change this type of logic tries to say if we didnt have a word for it it wont exist
get lost they are in the minority and cant cause the same physical damage you know that you ought to be ashamed
the comments ive read dont ask why sexism inherent in language is a problem it isnt only because the change in meaning illustrates the lower status of women but because once a highstatus word changes its meaning it is not usually replaced by an equivalent so now we dont have a female version of governor governess or a word to describe a clever woman shrewthats why so many women prefer to use the masculine versions of words which describe professions and occupations actor not actress author not authoress because these are are unlikely to suffer a diminishment of status
this is the newspeak language changed and uses changes it is not only terms that are used to describe women but terms that are used to describe disability and men the term cripple was not seen as a pejorative after the st world war but in the s the term became unacceptable as did the term handicapped which changed to disabled and now disabled is starting to pass out of use however is it really the language that is the problem or the society that uses them each generation adds meanings to different words and some meanings become unacceptable and others become acceptable it is as much to do with fashion as anything else how these accretions happen may be worthy of some study the words are the tools we use but the meanings we attach to them are ours and they change over time
because many men find sexism selfvalidating
 the fact that men are strong and should be able to control their women
women are just as likely to abuse kids just saying
the history of terms that refer to women shows how deep negative attitudes goyes this is an article about the history of the language to show how sexist society used modern english is much fairer and gender balanced reflecting our fairer society most of the folks commenting are missing this point it seems
the most obvious problem is the lack of a neutral alternative to he or she when you dont know the gender of some living being the language is crying out for it and yet doesnt have it
considering that you expect to be mocked i would like to add my explicit support we need stop denigrating half the population this is neither ok nor healthy
consider yourself mocked
secretary of state for health being one of them
nope so it stands to reason that an article examining the meaning of and history of words would be about english words rather than words from other languages nope english is targeted because feminists see it as the language of white privilege and scrutinizing other languages would be oppression and discrimination in their eyes
not the impression i got they seemed to be saying misogyny is endemic implying that society hasnt changed rather than language
some people have too much time on their hands never mind the immigration crisis theres the word rabid to worry about
because the powerful direct scorn at the weak in language as well in other ways and until the s men had nearly all the power in englishspeaking countries
what is needed is an entirely new language perhaps we could change english to espermanto i mean esperanto may i suggest volapük instead the language is older than esperanto for starters so its got seniority going for it and it is much more entertaining also like english it doesnt have grammatical gender except in personal pronouns what it does have is an wonderfully complex inflection system for both nouns and verbs so its a lot more fun to learn although i dont know if we should adopt the original volapük from  volapük rigik or the revised version from  volapük nulik
abuser rapist tormentor or scum commonly known as men how many female dictators have there been who have been the ones who push the war buttons yet god forbid a woman has a sexuality and watch the names that follow
tart is still used a lot david could have chosen words such as bitch slag slut catty and many more though i suppose he was trying to use examples where the female words had male equivalents with different connotations
wanker dick not you just adding to the list
ah brilliant article let me see if i can do it just like you i believe that davids surname reveal his hidden hatred for women and women rights
have any of them altered their meaning in the last ten minutes we know society used to be terribly sexist its far far far less so now also he missed out slut which used to mean messy as far as i know
im sure it would be more entertaining than this article
now you might argue this infringes free speech but free speech is not a free for all respect and responsibility including understanding the social context in which youre speaking is important that is what every extremist in history has said
this must have been the assignment from hell thats hell as derived from a norse word meaning cave some pejoration there find some examples as quasisexist as rabid feminist  out of  whats pejorative about governess society included such a function it needed a word wench apparently changed meaning from female infant to wanton woman between the th and th centuries since then it has actually reverted viz the phrase comely wench in carry on henry blackadder etc hardly a descent into misogyny as for spinster this was another position that needed a word it is silly to use it as an example of sexism when the male equivalent bachelor only needs the word confirmed in front of it to morph into a sly name for a homosexual in other words it happens all the time to all kinds of words and the fact that some of them are feminine is simply a part of how language develops desperate stuff
no worries i get moderated to within an inch of my life on a regular basis on here
even in its mildest form of dismissal as irrelevant to the commenter im dismissing the authors attempt to support a hypothesis not dismissing the hypothesis the author already tells us that linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men but it isnt accurate to say that these are eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language these are eight words with historical changes that might or even appear to have been sexist in nature but they dont on their own reveal anything about the heart of the english language
the google ngrams tool which can be quite interesting does suggest that usage of the word peaked in the mids and mids ill grant you lest you think i am some kind of crusty old sod allow me just to point out that i am also in my s nevertheless the marriage certificate of my grandfather in the early s his second marriage rather quaintly lists shoe shop manageress as his new wifes occupation she was also forgive the pejorative term a spinster
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language is the headline
it is and it isnt cowboy up or cowgirl up means to toughen up but a cowboy can also mean someone who is crude in their ways as in some cowboy got into the software and totally screwed things up
but english does have genderspecific pronouns he she his her unlike say japanese i dont see how french having gender for inanimate objects la table is conducive to sexism in any case sexism is not inherent to language but part of usage for example although the japanese language does not use gender in grammar no one would say japanese culture is nonsexist
with all due respect i think all this article proves is that words evolve and develop nuances over time its nothing to do with sexism for example if you say coffee shop a lot of people would think of smoking marijuana in amsterdam rather than drinking coffee surely its a virtue of english that words evolve and take on varied meanings it reflects the richness of the language
women tend not to be very impressed with men
a rabid animal is one infected with the rabies virus humans are animals and susceptible to rabies so what else is new
i am impressed men who are not a bit like women are probably not human
i read in an etymology book that welsh rarebit used to be pronounced welsh rabbit and was basically a joke that if a welshman invited you for a nice rabbit dinner hed probably serve you cheese on toast apparently dirt floors also used to be known as welsh carpets
if you advertised a job where people go down womanholes youd have a lot more people applying to be sewerage workers
not so there are numerous terms that define men in unflattering ways eg rake rapist philanderer almost every criminal term is assumed to be a male unless specifically reported as a female i am sure most honest people will admit that they think man when they hear the word paedophile
kind of the middle classes employ au pairs the upper classes employ nannies mostly although some may refer to them as a governess thats vanishingly rare
im totally with this articlethe insinuation that everyday words like nagging grating shrill etc are largely female characteristics is ing sad the extension of how sexism embedded in our society is strengthened by our choice of words unconscious or not im sure ill be mocked for this opinion but when i see how my daughter is bullied at school it seems no coincidence that this has arisen alongside the rise of gangstaspeak spread throughout her year shes called ho and bitch by boys almost every day if we introduce negative labels with language we become comfortable with our discrimination we then follow up by persecuting by extension may i presume the oed will continue to adjust words to be be more pejoratively racist in definition as the immigrant crisis continues to stir up resentment i know that this is a factual intellectual reference book and not a work of morality but to take words that are essentially neutral in definition and ease them along into the pejorative is extremely disappointing to say the leastthe inclusion of historical words like wench in the article seems neither here nor there a distraction to the argument
because noone out side of an agetha christie production has used the word spinster since about 
ahhh well other languages might be a bit embarrassing if we do that
there are names for evil people abuser rapist tormentor or scum would do nicely for one who hurts another human in that way the difference is those words arent gender bound like mistress etc are
you say batter i think pancakes
thats quite straightforward a friend of mine was told by a university lecturer that the word exotic was racist i think there exists a dictionary of allegedly racist words
he doesnt make the point he offers it inaccurately as a paraphrase of the oeds observation that their brief is to reflect rather than prescribe language use
words just cannot express my outrage this is the most deeply shocking indictment of neotorynazisexistracistscumcapitalism i have ever read action is needed im off for a dump
there are plenty of males who love to play the game of making women into helpless victims its not just a jessica valenti sport
a arse that wench has a gorgeous arseb bum that spinster has a gorgeous bumc hmm best stop there
also travesty
only a moron would think that its a ground breaking discovery that there are pejorative gender specific adjectival nouns in the english language
bastard
no theyre called bullies
why do you presume that
i seem to remember andrea dworkin sorting out the entire language with her dicktionary clever huh but not as clever as the roger mellie one although i think thats actually a thesaurus
nyet
i can assure you the charge of sexism is routinely levelled if one doesnt use one of other of the clumpy formulations that indicate gender nonspecificity so for example engineer is ingenieur or ingenieurin understandably in job adverts they will state were looking for einen ingenieur in in formal writing its not so bad but if youre speaking of a gender mixed group of engineers you have to say die ingenieure beziehungsweise ingenieurinnen and that is well clunky
you beat me to it it was however brought home to me rather forcefully that calling a girl a wench once youre outside the black country in this case in yorkshire was not acceptable
tart hussy madam i seem to have gotten lost and ended up in a sitcom from 
 by this we have to presume that you have gone and compare this language with many others and have then concluded that this was unique to the english languageno claim was made about english compared to any other language stop the whataboutery
and would you like your coffee with or without milk
perhaps you should reread using your finger and spellingout the meaning of the words the argument is that words which were once neutral often with a complementary masculine form have degenerated into sexist terms usually centred on condemnation of inappropriate sexual behaviour
eyecan think of one word that reveals the sexism at the heart of the guardians editorial policy httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreefebshhletmemansplainmacquariedictionaryswordoftheyeartoyou httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejunmansplainingexplainedexpertwomen httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreepicturejanisitsexistagainstmenfirstdogmoonsplainssexismagain httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejultomjunodpraiseolderwomenmansplaining httpwwwtheguardiancombooksaprracewitmansplainingwomenauthorslosangelesbooksfestival httpwwwtheguardiancombooksaustraliabooksblogfebmansplainisaustralianwordoftheyear
i thought male was a diminutive form of the root word female and likewise for woman and man
im looking forward to shariatmadaris companion article on the sexist linguistic denigration of men next week itll be bollocks
er in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world
most of them are yes but i was saying master in this sense is old fashioned whereas miss isnti thought a neckbeard was actually a description of a beard i didnt know it described a person what is it supposed to implyive never heard dudebro again what kind of person is it supposed to suggestmansplaining is a load of shite which i think has happily already faded out of use i wouldnt say it denigrates masculinity though just men it is basically implying that men are patronising which i wouldnt say was a masculine trait
cripes
funny i just checked and the dictionary doesnt have the obfuscating david shariatmadari which seems like a missed opportunity
its kind of heartening to note that most of the words on the list are no longer used at all really whens the last time you heard some referred to as a courtesan
the headline
try looking up e in the oed as for your context canard have you seen the size of the oed heres the e from the oed perhaps the entire staff of the school were rabid feminists but if so we did not know and we certainly werent its interesting that the e doesnt give any indication as to the authors point of view about rabid feminists though knowing as we all now do that she was herself a distinguished feminist it seems at least plausible that she was using the expression with some irony
so youre upset mistress can be used in a negative way it must only have one use you ignored how master can be used negatively master and slave does that sound positive to youi think youre jumping through hoops to find a problem
nor are there any dames spinster to balance our knights bachelor
i think it requires both an adjective and a noun professional victim
the lack of noun genders in the english language is an indication of its inherent nonsexism we dont need no der die das
and cowgirl
i am sure a feminist could also write an article about words which affect men but this was about single words which none of your examples were as they were phrases
excellent david we should be more conscious of the language we use even the cliches one of the points of oxford dictionaries part of oxford university press oup is to show how words are used in the real world and that is their response to allegations of sexism the example sentences we use are taken from a huge variety of different sources and do not represent the views or opinions of oxford university press they said in a statement take the word dirty not so long ago the collocation jew would have been on the tip of very many tongues but this would obviously not give the oup editorial cover even in pointing out what other people say the oup has a degree of responsibility and i say this as a rabidfluffyvery nice vegetarian atheist 
hit a raw nerve have we im not sure if youve noticed but the guardian is an english newspaper its based in england and is written broadly from an english perspective in the english language for an englishspeaking audience so it stands to reason that an article examining the meaning of and history of words would be about english words rather than words from other languages im sure that there are plenty of words in pali sanskrit urdu and hindi that have sexist connotations however since i like the vast majority of guardian readers do not speak a single word of any of those languages i would be completely unaware of the connotations of those words or how widespread their use is and any number of other facts about them that would be central to making sense of the article
what you point out is not sexism but language shift you can find words that shift the opposite way language shift happens all the time right down to vowel shifts for a political case to be made you have at least look at the other side and make a judgment about that too
rule of thumb was that intentional
 goes the weasel was my first thought i laugh about this one sentence of waugh whenever i reread it
dont you mean belly ache i have never heard of the term ball ache and i have a husband  sons and numerous male colleagues and friends
what does it say about the collocation utter tripe

buuuh i dont have an uncle ali my uncles are paddy pedro and mick you are talkin to me right
as if not quite convinced by its own explanation the oup is now reviewing the example sentence how about as an intelligent scientifically correct response demonstrating openness to external criticsm the oup is now reviewing the example sentence or is that not snide enough
you silly chap you didnt mention common purpose or political correctness gone mad
im with you i dont see the more dated words in the article as having any impact just as reflecting our cultural pastthanks
in fact the best example is madam today anybody younger than  just consider it an awkward way to start an email and certainly not for the brothelconnotation which the author claimed has been used since the th century i would say that usage will die with the older generations of today
heh heh i dont even need to look btl to picture the foaming indignation of the poor oppressed males at this article
since gay males come in every flavor i though that was the condom 
i wonder how selfsatisfied the author was before he submitted this drivel i wonder why he didnt consider the word bastard once a highly offensive term for illegitimate children of either gender sorry this is the guardian an illegitimate child from wherever it appears on our nonbinary gender spectrum now its never applied for its original purpose but is instead just used as a term of abuse exclusively toward men still why allow complexity to interfere with the cultural masochism of guiltridden men that the guardian so excels in
go on give us 
according to the oxford english corpusonly men seem to hijack crouch kidnap rob grin shoot dig stagger leap invent or brandish women meanwhile tend to be the only ones to consent faint sob cohabit undress clutch scorn or gossip
let realworld usage not political correctness drive the content and examples language usage exemplified by real people how they use the language and not the spin masters opinion makers who inundate the social sphere with their bent to a word or concept the freedom to be who we are and not who we are guided to be anyway 
what a silly article
are there any negative words from males which are gender specific yes are there any positive words for females which are gender specific yes right but the article doesnt in any way contradict either of those points it focuses on the way some femalespecific words have becmoe more pejorative compared to their male equivalents over time which is still a minor point but quite different from what you seem to be imagining it says
example acknowleged my point is that thats nothing to do with language its to do with society attitudes hopefully ur daughter will grow up to be assertive without being seen as bossybut i honestly for example dont see anything wrong with madam as a word for a brothel manager its just a word which is given a seconfary meaning the job would exist whether shes called a madam or not
i didnt read enough comments to see the random attacks but nevertheless this in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world does appear to indicate the author is singling out english or at least those who speak it even his examples dont hold and are out of date in  bachelor or courtier are no more complimentary than spinster or courtesan in the s yes but now no
well this conversation is mostly about the article above and emer otooles recent article the article above doesnt remotely call for the elimination of politially incorrect language and otooles article while a bit more rabid than this one still stops an awfully long way short of that since it is merely about whether the phrase is an appropriate one to use as a sample phrase in a dictionary dont let that distract you from your paper tiger hunt though
im sure they hang on every word david shariamadari writes
the guardian is running out of money it needs to cut millions of dollars in spending it would do well to start by refraining from commissioning drivel like this
interesting that at least in the cases of the examples cited in this article the pejoration of words for women seems to have coincided with the beginnings of the industrial revolution maybe patriarchy got its paws into language as the growing merchant class sent its sons off to education and groomed its daughters to be wives and mothers ironically jane austen is a window onto this world being one of the exceptions that proves the rule
the denigration of half of the population has embedded itself in the language in ways you may not even be aware of indeed david with the entry word between asterisks like this here are some more sample sentences from the oed again hes very uncooperative and aggressivehe was a depraved man who had abused his two young daughtershe had been abusing his body for yearshe is a filthy drunken beasta woman whose husband would frequently beat her after becoming drunkanne was irritated by his cavalier attitudedoes the connotation of backlash really cover the possibility that a cheater would be punished for his cheatingthey set the cheater up to lose and then bust himof course at some point somebody is going to say your old man was a cheaterher former boyfriend was convicted of assaulting herthese men are dangerous criminalsa warning to men harassing women at workhe gives them with a sinister look or two with a leer on his facehe was charged with molesting and taking photographs of a tenyearold boy additionally the claim made that linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men  is hotly contested and by no means axiomatic some data to support the assertion was not forthcoming and can be presumed to be nonexistent amusingly the sample sentence for misandry isher brand of feminism is just poorly disguised misandry we should probably change the possessive adjective there huh it would make it more relevant to the author and challenge gender stereotypes quite how david squares being motivated to write the poorly researched screed above with being either utterly unaware of or indifferent to the obvious gender biases listed is unclear a much funnier expose of the hypocrisy of the definitelynotatallrabid feminists can be found here
all stubborn people are applauded that is the result of human stupidity
sarcasm classy
traditionally a prostitute who plied her trade out of doors eg under hedges in fields wherever cf hedgepriest hedgedoctor etc
what can be more sexist than the french language you have to call a table la and a boat le
its possible to comment on how language use reflects attitudes without advocating censorship the writer isnt saying that language is the problem its just a reflection of our sexist culture and the examples above serve as evidence of that i think you should retread the article because you havent understood it properly
in ouwer house itiz the fuckin control as oos gotwhere thr fuckin ell is and is the fuckin control under your fuckin arse againetc
theres no suggestion in the article this is a problem only in english
a number of commenters have already listed numerous examples of neutral words that are now derogatory to men unfairly outweighing situations to make them sound unfairly sexist actually hurts the cause of feminism
as journalism go this is really lame stuff are there any negative words from males which are gender specific yes are there any positive words for females which are gender specific yes is this is a useless cultural marxism apology piece yes
archaic words reflect archaic attitudesin other news people used to buy their kids golliwogs
treealert youve only gone and done it again love
theres no implication in the article that other languages arent sexist and try googling cynthia payne to see if you get more results for madame or madam not that i really care about that particular usage but i dont understand why you are being pedantic about it
ah the guardians new word crime machine pop in one see if it comes up with lots of female connections sexist and must be expunged im going to describe this using a nongender specific insult load of old pony
apart from rabid feminists
please dont ever become a teacheryour game of pedantics will bore the pants off even the keenest of learners
i dont think the writer is trying to do either a or b
madame is often used to describe a brothel keeper oooh those frenchies ehh nudge nudge wink wink ows yer father nice little anti muslim bit tacked on eh eh eh
by whom and when
right so unless sexism is as bad as it is in the worst most regressive places in the world we shouldnt comment on it got it
a very good question
women cant cause the same damageplease tell me youre a troll
no it wouldnt any more than calling someone a twat would be sexist it must be very confusing for people who see paper tigers everywhere though
in victorian lowlife slang gay was applied to female prostitutes
outside of the bubble does anyone say governor except for a speed control on a machineif anyone does it might be the police but then they also use words like adjacent
welching on a betwelshing on a betwelsh guardswelch guards a rbloody slimy slip out
true my boss regularly refers to me as a lady even though he knows im a bloke i expect its just because im wellgroomed
lucky noone is doing the latter then
for the same reason that cabletv is shortened to cable the identifying distinction is in the delivery of the function remember when people used to refer to a radio as the wireless from wireless telegraphy
i have never heard this expression ever so you might want to redefine women everywhere
i dont think thats correct re madammadame and why not comment on english usage shouldnt we try to make things better
call you a muzz if you want
a despite the dozens of comments bizarrely attacking islam arabs etc the writer didnt compare english to any other language he examined it on its own merits whats wrong with that b hes not demanding change hes illustrating it looking at the history of the language the writer lists older words that have fallen out of use that reflect the sexist society that produced them this was a thoughtful informative and interesting piece im glad he wrote it im glad its riled up so much anger insults and dismissal its a sign of comfortable ingrained ideas and prejudices being challenged folks dont like that
ball ache used by women everywhere how could they possibly know
do you have examples
personally i would think that the person telling me who was on the phone was being negative if they said there was a woman on the phone as opposed to a lady
when i hear rabid i think of a dog
its the thin end of a very thick wedge i agree that feminists like me miss the wood for the trees at times but i dont think this is an example of that i kind of think that these insidious connotations are close to the root of the problem
well i see what youre saying but just to get a bit pedantic about it it rather depends on what you think embedded means in this context youre taking it mean inherent in the word itself regardless of use whereas all the examples he is discussing are ones where the pejorative use has developed over time in other words the sexism has become embedded in a word that isnt inherently sexist semantics i know and the poor headline encourages that view but i think the article itself is pretty reasonable so long as you dont take embedded to mean inherent
at a formal dinner run as ladies night by a well known male organisation many years ago my mum was required by custom to stand and thank my father for inviting all the ladies to the dinner she did but she ended by saying i am required by custom to thank my husband as master at this event but that would make me his mistress and im sure thats not what you want to hear so i wontjob done neither of them was ever invited again as shes still fond of saying everything has its compensations
frankly i cant believe the oed has allowed these words to sully their pages one can only assume theyre unaware of the extent to which theyve become pejoratificated over the years so i expect this article will be a bit of an eyeopener for them
lol
slow clap
jesus sexist term i learned all this at university in  get real
so you recognise that the phenomenon exists but still maintain that the writer is seeing something that isnt there that makes sense i didnt suggest that he is referring to a phenomenon which does exist and to my knowledge it exists in all language if that wasnt the case then looking into the reasons why that might be would of course make it more interesting and purposeful it is virtually a non article something which is becoming increasingly a feature on here
being gay sort of keeps you out of the inherited male privilege club unless your name is milo yiannopoulos 
stubborn men get applauded this argument could go on forever
dogging the question
men have eternally blamed women for their own helplessness before lustfrom the fairy tale of adam and eve its always been a womans fate to tempt man and mans fate to succumbwhy would anyone single out english specificallyi would be willing to bet that this sort of revisionist sexism occurs in every other language and culture therefore extant or extinct
i bet you could not give me an english novel set now written in the last  years which had an unironical use of the word courtesan
what do you think of when i say the word rabid is the answer bugs bunny
butthat sort of denigration is allowed coz its deemed as a just payback to this generation of youngish men for the sins of their forefathers unto the th generation bfe
but even middle england in the s has to be included if those usages are left out the dictionary itself in no longer neutral and unbiased
of course
camp
good i hope they fix this its exhausting preparing my fauxdaughters motherless nieces for the fed up world we live in wish women could just be allowed to live but everywhere you turn no no you play softball no no you get paid less because one day youll get knocked up aww isnt she cute shes doing trig problems uhg be fair thats it
even the application of simple seemingly harmless adjectives has an effect in my daughters school if a boy is aggressive he is assertive which is good if a girl is aggressive its bossy and thats bad etc now acknowledge my example
english speakers use of macho is a pejorative that is purely contrived in spanish the word macho means simply manly where is there anything negative to suggest that someone is a manly man this must confuse the spanish speakers to no end to call an man a manly man is high praise in a rational world but there are those who would like to twist our words
like the person using madam was thinking she was a whoremonger
can be either masculine or feminine like some birds the difference between the sexes is not readily evident the words can be common nouns when describing the entire class of creature as when a book uses the singular form to mean the whole group for example the pilchard from the s if memory serves interestingly our language has gender words for the animals closest to us be they pets or raised for food
brits had pretty negative overtones in northern ireland
are a big bush and a lot of pricks involved
a discussion of words their history use and negative connotations is interesting and enlightening going through the dictionary and attempting to eliminate anything that is politically incorrect is dark frightening and orwellian
the point is benlw those words used to have a neutral meaning they were what they were now their meaning is disproportionally loaded on the derogatory scale something which has not by and large happened to their male equivalents worth thinking about 
it is just a term of respect i would always use lady just as i use its equivalent gentleman in similar circumstances
wanker appears in the oed as a term of abuse that is used exclusively against men even though both men and women technically can qualify
im curious why precisely is it important what gets lost if we get rid of the word actress i use it myself sometimes but i just wonder why you feel this profession need it particularly the only people who need to differentiate are the casting people
i might well say there is a gentleman here to see you its not a archaism yet
r before c except after d
a lot of these comments are missing the point if your only example sentences for any concept are slanted so that they associate negative attributes with the concept being discussed that is a sending out subliminal messages to users of the dictionary and b not very good lexicography there are plenty of example sentences which could be used which do not associate negative attributes with a societal group eg he heard the shrill sound of the factory whistle there was a grating sound like a key turning in a rusty lock etc it doesnt say much for oed that they cant examine the millions of words in the corpora they use and come up with better examples on that basis i can think of a few example sentences for some of the commenters here his antifeminist ranting grated on all who heard it his shrill denunciations of  of the worlds population betrayed his sense of hysteria he had a nagging feeling that people laughed at his misogynistic views behind his back these are all valid example sentences for the words concerned but i suspect some of the commenters here would be spluttering into their cornflakes about how this was inappropriate
thanks for the rather pointless and useless advice
i cant even
its called an opinion live with it
modern women what a bizzare description so that fact that women have belittled men for centuries in return for the legal atrocity of being statutorily belittled without any justification other than some ludicrous theological inventions is not ok huh i suppose it isnt
as the oed guy said they derive these examples from the corpus and high frequency usage theyre definitions by themselves hardly portraying as anything and more reflecting use has this guy ever heard of a collocation
id be surprised if anyone using a dictionary didnt realise that rabid used as a description was derogatory
heres a handy table listing percentages of female mps worldwide the scandinavian countries appear to be making an effort though the usual woman oppressing horrors are languishing at the bottom of the list httpwwwipuorgwmneclassifhtm so which way should we go
you seem to be very judgemental this was a male phd who made the suggestion why dont you take a look at the womens equality party and you may pick up on a few more accurate facts about current uk feminism i wont be voting for hc not because of her reproductive organs but because were in the uk but i will be voting for equality httpwwwwomensequalityorgukelection
but the initial point was made by a phd candidate in anthropology and i think his point was a valid one but on what grounds do you believe the anthropology phd candidates claim to be valid you seem to want to argue that oxford dictionaries erred but yet cant quite bring yourself to make a coherent case demonstrating or otherwise presenting compelling evidence of an error again i believe those comments are valid for the reasons i stated earlier you never stated any such reasons you merely pointed out that they made use of their judgement in the course of their work amp called their judgement into question whilst never providing any grounds for doubting their judgement when pressed on this you simply called their impartiality as members of the academic community into question not once did you provide any reasons as to why their judgement or impartiality ought to be called into question in this case dictionaries are by design as well as by nature conservative for good reason that does not mean that the occasional push to consider that certain usages may be outmoded is necessarily unwelcome this is very vague amp general it can be applied to just about anything okay now that there has been a push amp people are listening its time to make ones case as to how exactly oxford dictionaries has erred here oxforddictionaries kind of invited the response with their original snarky comment as well irrelevant
role of dictionary is to document the language if you look up generically offensive words in the oxford dictionary youll notice that they are frequently appended with modifiers such as vulgar or slang other dictionaries might use offensive or derogatory in similar circumstances that is not the case here with rabid some synonyms may be fairly benign such as ardent whereas others clearly less so like strident if you are documenting the language then you also have to acknowledge how it is used literally rabies is a fatal viral disease confined largely to animals often dogs that is transmissable to humans but the literal literally takes second place when it comes to the adjectival form rabid pronunciation ˈrabɪdˈreɪbɪddefinition of rabid in englishadjective  having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something a rabid feminist  of an animal affected with rabies her mother was bitten by a rabid dog
so what dont speak out because you will get shouted down accept abuse from one person in case more people abuse you dear oh dear
but in that case nagging is used metaphorically figuratively surely
i hope you watch series on lmn channel in the us it may require a micawberian view
youve obviously never lived in the philippines
oh the irony
no he didnt suggest that they should remove any description merely mentioned that the description is apt you do not seem to understand the word hypocrisy i suggest a dictionary
perhaps rather than changing the example they should adjust the definition to more accurately represent the meaning of what is being said rabida derogatory adjective used to dehumanise and undermine the argument of someone who tenaciously holds a viewpoint you disagree with eg shut your whore mouth you rabid feminist sexism doesnt exist anymore
if society is so structured that lt  of women feel able to get into politics or any other profession or occupation that doesnt rely on upper body strength then that society is sexist
but there is no need to add typically male is therewell i think there is but using the complainants logic there isnt still if they had left it out im sure it would have come under attack by feminists
oh the irony well duh
yes thats definitely the problem women dont understand egalitarianism i suggested enriquo pablez doesnt worry about a simple thing like picking less stereo typed examples for a dictionary because it was quite clearly disproportionately upsetting him he thinks its irrational bullying there are some major horrors he could worry about instead if he wants
im sorry im a brazilian woman from a working class background leftwing and sociologist but if there is one thing a have no patience for is this now distortion of what feminism was meant to be not a permanent us vs them nitpicking exercise by people with too much money and time in their hands but rather a movement seeking to address real gender inequality an inordinate amount of time seems to be spent on language being a portuguese speaker it would be hilarious if time were devoted to weed out sexism from it after all nouns are either masculine and feminine and im sure someone could selectively make a case for changing some of them whilst i appreciate that some discourses can be downright sexist but also easily shot down i just wished that feminists showed the same zeal towards inequalities that affect women men and children alike the fact is that just like overpopulation check samir amins take on the subject sexism will not be eradicated or contained unless we improve the living standard but then these feminists are the same ones whod vote for hillary clinton because she has ovaries
eh
indeed but in feminist theory statistics can be good antimaleprofemale or bad antifemale anything as a result of a bad statistic is sexist any that is is a result of a good one is just and truehence men are victims of violence more often is bad men commit violence more often is good see also women find jail tough good jail them less men get sentenced for longer for the same crimes the sound of whistling
better to change the usage and the dictionary will follow than change the dictionary so it no longer shows the world as it is not really if sexist terms for example are in common usage lexicographers have to record those terms of course but any good dictionary will also point out that such terms are sexist or racist or offensive or derogatory or whatever we dont tend to say that the word paki simply means a person of pakistani origin for example theres so much more to the word than that and to pretend otherwise is not helpful to anyone looking it up
i am the same age as joachim and his words ring true i feel that i and my male friends have absorbed the message i dont feel i can say the same about very many modern women who casually belittle stereotype men and boys without a hint of selfawareness or shame
to those who are making flippant rude remarks with regards to evolving our language to reflect gender inclusive may i remind that all of the cases of violence towards women are rooted in patriarchy every male dominated organization from police military fire departments even board rooms have to adapt btw women in canada have not been deemed persons under the law until  nor could wombs vote just days after most of spaniards bays volunteer fire department quit after the lone female member came forward with harassment allegations members of the eastern newfoundland towns council gathered saturday for a closeddoor meeting that included a discussion about sexual harassment policies and training our species outrageously overpopulated we mostly live in tightly packed urban environments and it is essential that we all embrace good manners public courtesy and respect for the space of the other is it too much to ask
im not quite sure what youre objecting to i dont really give a crap about the twitter storm it will like all the others blow over as soon as the next shiny thing comes along to distract the twitteratibut the initial point was made by a phd candidate in anthropology and i think his point was a valid one i think it is you who are being distracted by your justifiable dislike of the amplification medium for the original criticism such that you are ignoring the basis of the complaint again i believe those comments are valid for the reasons i stated earlier not because a bunch of bandwagon jumpers on twitter got a hair up their collective ass about itdictionaries are by design as well as by nature conservative for good reason that does not mean that the occasional push to consider that certain usages may be outmoded is necessarily unwelcomeoxforddictionaries kind of invited the response with their original snarky comment as well
upvoted for the overall sentiment downvoted again for the use of going forward
who wrote this lazy headline the whole article discusses examples not definitions which perhaps should be reviewed too but theres no evidence in this text
do stop exaggerating
ive got a nagging suspicion that that is a different usage unless your headache can talk in which case id advise a lucrative career
the difference being rabid feminist is a political description
hear hear
im not saying they cant be i could label myself one right now and i wouldnt fit into that category of being a sex pest i just think its generally seen to be the case and therefore undermines feminism its actually quite a strong and important label to give yourself a feminist i just dont feel that you can say it with any real conviction which i think is really important without being a victim of the patriarchy yourself
we no longer use the term chairman in board rooms it is the chair
fyi oed is an ever evolving entity
another piece of pure drivel oooh arent i clever look at me and how quickly i can go viral kind of stuff that the guardian should promote this says a lot for the utter clickbait and financially driven hypocrisy that media opt for and this is in my opinion an example of media contributing to the slow destruction of behaviourand society needs behaviour
maybe we can redefine extreme pettiness as omanreaganist
this chap has clearly been chewing the dictionary
your argument is implicit that theres such a thing as sexism towards men it doesnt existyoure making that argument from a position of privilege to undermine that of the one from the oppressed creepy
i wouldnt take too much notice him being one of the rabid antifeminists
if the usage rabid feminist is an attested collocation then its the lexicographers job to record it speaking as someone who worked as a lexicographer and dictionary editor for over two decades yes and no the collocation rabid feminist doesnt sound like the most common one to me tbh would have to check a good uptodate corpus i would hazard that this word has many frequent collocations and the lexicographer usually has to select only one or maybe two to illustrate usage and yes ive known many a lexicographer who tries to sneak their own prejudices or injokes into examples something that any decent lexicographical editor will weed out i think one of the examples i put in a dictionary many years ago referred to rabid antismokers even though i dont smoke which i think was a fair representation of the usage of the word what we did point out though is that the adjective rabid is a negative one used by people who disagree strongly with the opinions of the person they are referring to and regard them as extreme and unreasonable this does not mean lexicographers are saying the opinions of the person referred to actually are extreme and unreasonable if a particular word is used and associated negatively with a particular group according to corpus evidence then it is equally incumbent on the lexicographer to flag that up so the word shrill can be described as a word used derogatively about women whose opinions you disagree with how many men are referred to as shrill when it comes to commenting on their opinions the connotations intent and typical context of any word are as important as its denotation and it is the lexicographers job to record this too still as samuel johnson rightly said every other author can aspire to praise the lexicographer can only hope to escape blame twas ever thus and if i or any other lexicographer had to justify argue about and defend every definition and every example theyd ever written edited or approved for publication it would have been practically impossible for any dictionary to have progressed even half way through the letter a
so i checked against the oed for the n word and of course its there one is inexorably reminded of a favourite johnson anecdote mrs digby told me that when she lived in london with her sister mrs brooke they were every now and then honoured by the visits of dr samuel johnson he called on them one day soon after the publication of his immortal dictionary the two ladies paid him due compliments on the occasion amongst other topics of praise they very much commended the omission of all naughty words what my dears then you have been looking for them said the moralist the ladies confused at being thus caught dropped the subject of the dictionary
maybe it should be rabid anthropologist
women cannot be criticised blimey i wish id known that well if a male critisizes a women hes likely going to be accused of sexism or mysoginy or some white knite my step in to offer to beat them up one stereotype put around mercilessly is that feminists hate men rabid feminists hate men who critisize feminism
i agree remember dr samuel johnsons meaning of horsegram 
to the left everyone is rabidly rightwing it simplifies things for them
unfortunately so and always complaining about the left is the telegraph not good enough for you
i think its hugely helpful when men identify as feminists and it doesnt have to make them some kind of sex pest weirdos most of the men i know who identify as feminists are happily married often with children but thats purely anecdotal of course
what has reading mein kampf got to do with selecting examples of language use for a dictionary
in its loosest sense rabid just means ferociously raging which indeed some feminists are are the feminists going to ask for the word pig to be unlinked from the phrase male chauvinist i suspect not
that isnt a viable measure of equality theres too many unknown factors to get  female mps wed need a voting system that forced  of women to be elected and how can such a system be fair or do you suggest radically restructuring society so that more women will want to get into politics and pursue policies that will ensure people will vote for them  of the time its completely unworkable surely you see that
remove or replace with a more appropriate phrase like strong advocate of feminism a mouthful 
oed definition of feckless adjective lacking initiative or strength of character irresponsible her feckless younger brother look at that example sentence cant women be feckless too and sisters for that matter get me to a safe space asap
unless youre talking dogs the most prevalent context for rabid would be conjoined with feminist cue outrage from a noisy quarter when the oed is just doing its job
how is it sexist i thought feminists were both men and women
tell me that again when we have  female mps
different definition entirely
females and males are very different creatures in many many ways because that is what nature has created to increase the chances of survival of the species they are different not equal
and lots of men are feminists too
women cannot be criticised blimey i wish id known that one stereotype put around mercilessly is that feminists hate men yet feminism is a very large umbrella many of those under it are men and most of those under it do not hate men some of us even love and adore the men in our lives
rabid feminist is an example of a political ideology which means any other negative see the definition of rabid that the example is used to support sentences with other ideologies will have to be removed except i suspect we know that its one rule for some and a different one for others
lesson to learn never apologise on twitter stick to your guns if they so much as smell self doubt youre dead already look at trump dude never apologise for what he says and hes literally teflon
hyperbolic hatewhores oh the irony
dont think theyd be drinking anything as hardcore as bovril that would cause a level of anguish yet to be experienced
what i assume you believe you assume quite a lot here far too much i would say
it was one of many definitions usages if it was the only one maybe wrong but in this case the e is from a feminist author or is that the wrong sort of feminist
but in that case nagging is used metaphorically
orwell would be proud true language does to a certain extent influence ideas which is why we should never bow to pressure groups to control it unless there is very good reason for it in this particular case the reasoning is awful and oxford dictionaries should avoid any change
not a minority
very good point
this is ridiculous because the oed reflects language in use and has no normative mandate
i mean my actual point was that johnsons dictionary was massively subjective butok oh i see samuel johnsons two hundred year old dictionary was massivelly subjective therefore modern dictionaries produced by oxford dictionaries are also subjective do you see where you went wrong here
this all hinges on whether merely reflecting sexism ie in this case showing frequent current usage is in itself sexist personally i reserve the insult  youre a sexist  for people who actively promote sexism not those who merely reflect what they see around them
must they go too who said any were going considering youve come here to deride this twittystorm put what i assume you believe to be quintessentially pcleftiefeminstdeleteasapplicable words into inverted commas engage in flame wars with sjws and be generally complainy youre the one coming over as whiny proscriptive shrill and frankly hysterical you must be part of the outrage brigade of hyperbolic hatewhores
ignore the noise from twitter stand up for yourselves instead of folding like a damp lettuce if you want rabid ideologues to back off and leave you alone you need to adopt a policy of always giving in to them they hate that and wont be back to harass you in a hurry
it was at the point where i realised  of the people commenting failed to note that distinction that i gave up on this article and comment thread
i agree
no matter all of their dictionaries are meant to be descriptive none of their dictionaries are meant to lay out a set of prescriptive definitions which the lexicographers believe ought to be used 
usually heavily shamed people pleaser types seeking to obsequiously ingratiate themselves with women to feel a sense of acceptance and hence self esteem exactly and when he reaches the status of acceptance he turns all weird he comes up with statements such as i have this friend of mine who is thinking about joining a swingers clubshe whathe it was just an idea
ah changing dictionaries to appease an aggrieved minority this could end well
what kind of life is it to spend your days wandering around looking for things to be offended by that kind of life is fundamental to the guardian ethos dont you ever scan and mentally summarize the daily headlines
i dont think that its particularly helpful to label yourself a feminist as a manthe reason it exists is because theres an ingrained sexism in society which we will never experience it also undermines it i feel for the exact reason that the original poster said its just seen as entryism into your vagina to most im an ally according to my female friend
they are suppose to select an example that makes it easier to understand the correct use of the word and therefore to use it correctly rabid feminist does not do so precisely because it creates lots of heat but no light i would suggest rabid football fan does make it clearer one who have no interest in the reality of how the game was played or the quality of the players on their team but demands all see them as the best regardless all football fans recognise the type as do most none football fans the dictionaries suggestion that the term is not necessarily pejorative i hope is an example of desperate justification rather than what they truly believe if it is what they truly believe then they need better researchers
now if only modern feminists had got that message and could apply it to their thinking about men
horseshit
why are your criteria any more valid my point was just because twitter is a cancer doesnt mean everything posted on there is by default incorrect good god stop trying to shift the burden of proof amp present a case on what grounds do you believe that oxford dictionaries erred in their choice of examples is it because a twitterstorm was tripped off is it because it just feels wrong or do you have more substantial evidence of an error you seem to be arguing in favour of some impartial professionalism that you imagine exists in academia i would argue that such is not the case no im arguing that academia is generally more professional amp reliable as an objective amp impartial source of information than a twitterstorm if one wishes to challenge the professional judgement of the lexicographers then one ought to show up with something more substantial than twitter doesnt like it or it doesnt feel good
as i see you pretend that only yes sayers should write comments 
i mean my actual point was that johnsons dictionary was massively subjective butok
i take it you never read 
treating women equally is an offspring of thinking about them equally which cannot happen with the insidious sexism found in language
surely the word is robust as used in every ministerial statement
thinktry 
brothers husbands etc are defined by gender doctors and researchers are not its just that simple i am an architect i am a sister these things are not mutually exclusive
so this is how men and women communicate in the st century all those new laws havent lead to a better deeper more empathetic understanding between the sexes they have lead to miscommunication misunderstanding blatent supposition and pejorative semantics no wonder the birth rate is in decline you fools rabid feminism i like youtwitter storm i like you too so much
compassion or disdain being up nose being reminded of essentials 
duh im so sorry for misinterpreting you still half asleep back to work for me
really because reading your opening paragraph felt like early days grandmaster flash on the cutting and mixing decks thin end of the wedge this is how bad journalism is perpetuated
changing language does not create respect it creates an awful veneer of respect it means people speak their mind in their own homes with the curtains pulled only to those they trust and parrot the correct behaviour outside in full knowledge that if they make a mistake it could cost them a promotion or even their job it creates resentment it makes people prisoners of a sort the right to free speech implies freedom to have your own opinion no matter how objectionable if someone feels offended that is their issue as an individual if someone is physically harmed thats different then its everyones problem im offended every time i hear my prime ministers smug voice i turn the radio off no more offence im offended every time i hear a placename that has been changed to avoid offence i just think the original placename in my head i overwrite my surroundings with what i think regardless of what others would like me to think when someone stars out a swear word or some other bad word doesnt it make you think of what that word is does the starring out of words merely deflect the badness they were trying to avoid by using the stars back into the head of the reader yes it does this is my beef with those who tamper with language to effect social change it works academically on paper until you think of all those political prisoners who were tortured endured forced labour horrible things for decades and their opinion and views never changed surely the repressive governments missed an opportunity changing a few words would have been a cost saving in prison meals the fact is that attempts to force new thoughts new ideas onto those who have opinions on something doesnt work its window dressing people can only change themselves if they decide they want to changing words signage place names as they have done in new zealand doesnt count for anything it creates a minefield for the many at the risk of causing offence to a very vocal and very influential few
i am against censorship unfortunately the moderators here have to deal with the possibility that the guardian may face legal action if they allow certain comments to stand that isnt being pc that is being pragmatic in a world were the law is sometimes an assi would prefer for all comments to stand and for those who make comments to be legally liable that way we get to see all comments and criticise them if we wish
a jewish cemetery is vandalised and while the bbc news website may write it up its unlikely to be appearing on the national news any time soon the bbc news is the national news ed miliband claimed to be horrified by the latter im pretty sure he wasnt labour isnt my party but i see no reason to doubt his sincerity on this occasion racism does repulse most people and all rightthinking people and particularly in his case wasnt his father a jewish refugee from the nazis might imply a certain acquaintance with the actual fire wouldnt you say
interesting i found the es given in this article very shocking and couldnt believe he would say such highly offensive things but in context it doesnt look bad at all just goes to show that you shouldnt take things at face value because people have agendas
indeed did you know that lolas charged with childrens education no wonder people say were dumbing down if thats a criminal offence these days
the problem with pc is that racist or offensive language is not in its remit to deal with if you understand spiral dynamics orange and blue deal with blue and red pathologies respectively by tribal shunning and peer imposed laws green shows up its own internal pathology in judging that we should not judge
sometimes pc censorship can be sinister and frightening remember the danish cartoons satirising atrocities committed in the name of islam by depicting big m with a bomb as a turban the pc outrage was not at the atrocities but at infidels upsetting islamic fundamentalists who objected to big m being depicted at all this combined with raw fear of editors being murdered lead to massive pc approved censorship stopping the timely and approriate cartoons being shown in uk media
total disconnect between the first and second sentences what a strange post
the guardian and the mail are increasingly mirrorimages of each other reversed left to right and right to left its important to remember that having a daily mail for every conceivable political viewpoint is not the same as having a balanced press it just means the lies and distortion are coming at you from every direction
well since it came in i have received a lot less racial abuse than i experienced in the s and s or maybe you would like me to go through all of that again yeah come to think of it a lot of people on here probably would
we can all be offended by lots of things should we choose to be but certain sections of society are prone to doing offensive things then telling us we shouldnt complain about it because its offensive they hide behind the shield of political correctness by virtue of the protected status pc grants them
indeed its a sort of witch hunt to persecute those whose thoughts and views are not deemed sufficiently and dogmatically liberal within reason pc could be deemed a sensible extension of basic politeness but taken to the extremes we have today it has become farcical and is almost beyond parody
every single cif piece on it will be filled with people btl attempting to shut the debate down by shouting racism not true look at the number of antiimmigrantright wing posts on cif and the number of recommends they get they often heavily outnumber liberalleft wing opinion comments section at the guardian is looking more and more like the daily heil capitalism fails spectacularly massive inequalities emerge then as night follows day a massive swing to the right occurs and everyone projects their hurt and frustration onto minorities how predictable
after the disintegration of the communist regimes in  we entered a new era in which the predominant form of the exercise of state power became a depoliticised expert administration and the coordination of interests the only way to introduce passion into this kind of politics the only way to actively mobilise people is through fear the fear of immigrants the fear of crime the fear of godless sexual depravity the fear of the excessive state with its burden of high taxation and control the fear of ecological catastrophe as well as the fear of harassment political correctness is the exemplary liberal form of the politics of fear zizek under this analysis we should be thanking the pc brigade for their unceasing efforts in making sure many of us have something to resist with passionate motivation that said apology has absolutely no place in this what is more pathetic and worthy of contempt than he who one minute is motivated to speak his thoughts and immediately when challenged falls over and says oh well sorry since you dont like what i say i cant really be bothered after all
maybe those who cant keep a watch on what they say and blame the listener for getting offended should come to india we have declared homosexuality a criminal offence and we are obsessed with white skin just read one of the matrimonial ads put out here
no ones telling anyone how to think and talk all im saying is if you dont think about the consequences of what you say you may end up hurting people and alienating yourself this is basic behaviour you dont go around offending people and expect them to give you kisses and cuddles i never suggested i was better than anyone else thats all in your head and thanks for explaining what if you cant stand the heat get out the kitchen means i honestly had no idea
only guardian readers could get their knickers in a twist about this
using some sorry examples from a foulmouthed boor does not constitute a strong argument lets face it pc is ridiculous when it involves dropping adbc in favour of the americanism bce or calling a christmas tree a holiday tree stopping young kids from singing baa baa black sheep sacking a radio presenter for playing an ancient version of the sun has got his hat on or crying racism for using innocent terms like nitty gritty
because the words you mention belong in a different age an age when black people where lnyched a man could rape his wife there was no equalilty acts etc etcare you really blaming political correctness for stopping you from calling the black family next door negroes really 
we just had good manners no we didnt the racism was vile widespread and often shouted in your face
nigra use to be white people being polite back in the day to black people it is a little more than being polite it is not buying into sexism racism antisemitism homophobia and consciously speaking and thinking of people as equal we still have societies not interested in equality
thanks mick have one in returnonly  to go
i think the failure of the pc to understand context misdirection sarcasm and humour in general is telling of who is really intellectually deficient here spot on you may take a bow
if he was talking about jokes then why use gibson and baldwin as examples given that they made the comments whilst ranting against someone else
if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear which for some reason never includes being told that what youre saying is offensive bigoted hurtful etc etc
political correctness is a phrase which simply describes one application of what we used to know as politeness utter nonsense political correctness is a mask to avoid causing offence to those who claim that they have a right to never being offended and nobody has that right thats why for example i will happily be offensive to women who walk around disguising their identity
it has come to mean compulsory acceptance of what pc licenses and the demonisation of what it opposes what have you as an individual been compelled to accept
im sure there are some here whod be happy to burn him at the stake
you can make a lucrative career out of that on here dont knock it
funny that despite constant vigilance from the pc brigade many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please as you do here and in your other articles in which you ignore posters questions can we all have a guardian column please
i think the failure of the pc to understand context misdirection sarcasm and humour in general is telling of who is really intellectually deficient here
the mythical right to not be offended is a reactionary notion that belies your progressive rhetoric strangely enough i didnt say there was a right not to be offended i think though as a principle its not particularly frightening not to want to offend and upset people or think thats undesirable i mean if someone wants to be a dick thats their right but i dont particularly see it as something to applaud or indicative of any brave stance on their part i dont support criminalisation of speech but nor do i think that criticising someone for saying faggot is encroaching on free speech its a common trend it seems for some to pretend that the right to free speech means the right not to be criticised and condemned for it which in itself seems fairly antifree speech
my issue is that using the language of political correctness someone like nick griffin can appear to be reasoned and reasonable which we know if a front while i understand the danger of that his policies are still fairly indicative of what he thinks as well as the company he keeps i suppose the point is not to get complacent about it
with the best will in the world gary oldman has really shot himself in the foot while it was in his mouth i actually agree with all he says but am not sure like him that he should have said it he is a wonderful actor and i sincerely hope that this does not put paid to his career in hollywood
we all know hollywoods owners and we dont care i notice the moronracists still have their fav moovies like any crap with bruce willis trying to look tough gazza was speaking to playboy mag and the only people who look at the pics are wankers so he wood be better doing a centrespread there has been slavery and the holocaust i think they deserve a rest 
to a job writing second rate articles about second rate topics
except of course we are all coloured my colour apparently despite my slight summer tan is white what is yours
its all about halopolishing there was a time when doing good things towards others was considered to be the sign of a virtuous person these days holding the right opinions as defined by the bastion of morality that is the guardian seems to do the trick
how about everyone just being polite and not name call i guess there are too many angry people out there
look up patrice oneal pirate joke on youtube you might learn something about comedy
ah but oldman is rich white and male and hence has power hence when he says something bad about people who dont have power it carries so much more meaning nothing to do with hypocrisy more mental gymnastics and a defective mental process
the biggest lie told by the antipolitical correctness brigade is that you cant call a spade a spade doh if you are politically correct they argue that we are weak deluded liberals and lefties if we use polite terms in the context of gender race disability etc or if we use balanced indepth argument in reality most of the antipc brigade are intellectually lazy andor intellectually deficient they seem incapable or unwilling to see beyond stereotypical assumptions or labels they do not dig deep or look at the facts behind the facile soundbite
you seem to delight in missing the point the point i am missing being
yeah its an exchange of views you get all shades of opinion i have never noticed the pc brigade stopping debate
having read the full text of the interview and his apology to the adl hilarious i must disagree with ms okolosie its sad to see so many commentators siding with the thought police brigade where will it all lead us
but you ed them somewhat out of context which made them sound worse than they actually were they were still stupid things to say but you made it sound worse
the artricle confuses crude anti civiliseddeabasing bad manners swearing wity actual pc which seeks to censor reality on tv obscenities are now the norm but any non pc ords are traeted as a cpaital offense an example was on independent tv having to apologise for using the term coloured for a coloured person instead of black despite the person not being black but mildly brown ie coloured
i believe margarito may have been employing a comic device called sarcasm
of course certain columnists love political correctness after all they make a living out of being offended
yeah thats the reason
after all if the word was good enough for martin luther king it was good enough for my parents point taken i suppose thats what im saying about coloured i grew up in the s when negro definitely wasnt used in the uk and maybe even not in most of the states
not him but her
for gods sake just because savile was on the rampage doesnt mean the seventies were a benighted era of universal abuse thank you
but i can clearly remember phrases like the pi shop i can remember that phrase too and it was explicitly forbidden in our house in fact my parents didnt really need to forbid it because we just grew up knowing it was wrong i consider myself as coming from a workingclass background there were plenty of my peers who would never use such expressions our experience of mixing with other races was fairly limited but we just didnt use racist language
i wish i could tell you that youre welcome i cant becauseim shy is all
depends on your school i suppose but i bet the same kind of school would be just as full of that kind of language now i grew up at that time prepc and decent people knew what was and wasnt acceptable they also knew it was to do with social and racial inequality for gods sake just because savile was on the rampage doesnt mean the seventies were a benighted era of universal abuse
do you dream in colour
orwell is a huge problem for the left they want to claim him for their own he always said he was a socialist but at the same time the lefts authoritarianism was anathema to him another e the worst advertisement for socialism is its adherents
disgusted with oldman he should never have apologised should have said even more nonpc stuff
poor little gary oldham
honour killings are making inroads into the best enabled by political correctness
orwell best thinker since swift both of them would have anihilated pc scum
in this country political correctness facilitates honour killings
how can you attack porn magazines they do a great deal of good for many women face it decent society still mistreats women at the workplace etcwith these mags many women can at least get enough fuck you money to start their own businesses careers where they at not dependent on the moronic half of societygood for porn more pleasethe greatst crime there is is sanctimony the weapon of horrid people
i tend to think that people should have the right to offend just as people should have the right to feel offendedmuch better that someones ideas are given the light of day to be questioned in that daylight and see if there is any substance to their views or even more interestingly to find out what is causing them to hold those views what comes to mind as an example for me is obamas presidency here was a man who came across as caring and understanding then when he found office he went about assassinating people with abandon using drones some of these people being his own countrymen hardly anyone appears to have been able to confront him on this because of the obfuscation he brings to all matterssome times a pc attitude is one of obfuscation where it is used to gain privilege and not to enter into debate and understand underlying tensions and disagreements certain areas have become taboo and as a consequence the dynamics that cause those tensions are never understood and never explored
one of the unintended downsides of living in a society where weve come to understand that racist homophobic and misogynistic comments are beyond the pale is that many people who hold those views are capable of avoiding the obvious pitfall of using them and being labelled correctly for their views alternatively many people who do not have hate in their heart will do so from time to time because theyre lazy angry or weak i am all three from time to time but they are not really hateful not sure if celebrities have the right to complain after all they get a lot of perks from being in the public eye so the expectation they reign themselves in doesnt seem too onerous to me again not sure about mel but i think the point has merit
ok you either dont understand what i wrote or are pretending not to i was very clear i think theres a difference between manners and pc if you have a counter argument please make it stop hinting at one
and you are now the arbiter of whats funny are you judge jury and executioner
political correctness is in fact one of the great evils of our times worse than aids honour killings zach snyder films you need to sort out your priorities
the problem is twofold political correctness started out as an attempt to find courteous ways to describe groups of people etc a worthy attempt to not gratuitously insult others different to yourself so then we realised cripple bad obviously so disabled good hooray but then bad which leads to otherly abled good if somewhat obscure telekinesis perhaps this torturous and moveable minefield was diligently negotiated by the wellmeaning and kindly who were regularly pilloried by the slightly more avantegarde then there were those who were not the slightest bit wellmeaning and didnt really care whose feelings they hurt just didnt give a rats
political correctness as humourless language policing is an idea so normalised that blatantly racist sexist ableist and homophobic slurs can be protected under the rubric of free speech it has become banal and even tyrannical to try to argue for language and behaviour that respects women and minorities humour comedy relies on a shared understanding between the comic joketeller and the audience listeners the joke expresses the shared truth in an indirect way its funny because its true generally speaking this truth needs to be somewhat unexpected something that isnt normally said to be funny discriminatory humour has always relied on its implied wrongness all people of certain background are the same or do the same thing it is implied that although this doesnt sound coherent at all it is true discrimination for otherness is such a deeplyrooted feature of raw humanity that this kind of humour is universally available to different majorities in other words its easy humour a joke you can quickly exchange with other people without having to find a shared point of view you just need to look at their skin colour and listen to their accent and you know already so political correctness is fighting this nasty kind of humour it is a humourless language by definition an antihumour endeavour it is the quest to find a way of talking that is correct that is respectful and right not innovative surprising nor creative political correctness talk should not come as a surprise of any sort it should be the expected thing and thus never funny it has become a cliche that something that is funny to some is somewhat sacred because of how highly valued laughter and all its associated healthy features and effects are at the moment but the truth is that humour is a doubleedge sword a weapon without any ultimate morality laughter is not by definition a good thing it certainly can be great but the fact that someone is laughing is not enough to determine if a positive or a very negative thing is being said humour can express other shared truths and values truths that however cynical are ultimately progressive and deeply moral the fact that gary oldman has not got this perspective on humour being a professional involved in storytelling for decades is baffling but i suppose it expresses the prejudice at the heart of the white heterosexual male americanenglish group embodied and embroidered in the hollywood narrative eg mainly white male american or american sounding protagonists i know what i write here is not funny amusing probably not even entertaining in the least but thats the point we should not be laughing about the nasty shared truths we are prone to when uneducated about it we should be laughing at revealing insights humour should be pushing forward rather than backwards
i thought it was the it came from the portuguese slaving ships because the word negro is portuguese for black
nope i wont be replying to hateful comments i rarely bother to even read the replies dont worry mate once i got past the first paragraph of gibberish i didnt read any more of yours either
i see the usual cliches about pc as politeness and not tolerating the intolerant are the guardian picks how unsurprising if we were mot to tolerate the intolerant then the guardian and the left would be in deep trouble political correctness is in fact one of the great evils of our times and perhaps even an existential issue it is an continuation of socialism fascism by other means embodying the gramscian approach and featuring the anti social malevolence of the frankfurt school and the hatred for freedom that is a defining attribute of socialism in all forms so pervasive has it come that many people have ceased to understand what tolerance is and sometimes appear to have lost their minds tolerance is specifically an accommodation with something you dont yourself appreciate or agree with it has been turned into its opposite by pc it has come to mean compulsory acceptance of what pc licenses and the demonisation of what it opposes we are a long way from politeness here as for people losing their marbles does anyone _seriously_ believe that this ludicrous fabricant guy had any real intent to commit violence against yab who shielded by pc regularly comes our with far far more dangerous things versus a slightly crass display of frustration if so i put it to you that you have lost all perspective pc builds on intentional aims of the leftists mentioned above and the left generally to corrode and ultimately collapse free society by controlling language and thus thought attacking the social fabric and the traditions that bind it and undermining the basis of free society with ludicrous oppressor oppressed models substituting rational assessment of any given situation it is not about politeness which belongs to all decent people not to a political ideology least of all a thuggish socialism
everyone is a bigot about something and in some way as the btl comments here highlight very clearly
i think most people would find it entirely acceptable if the comeback is proportional losing your job and therefore possibly your home and family into the bargain seems rather a high price to pay for using a few words at work that someone decides they dont happen to like equally it seems odd that some people have have returned what they presumably consider nonpc terms with physical violent and actual bodily harm that just seems odd to me you called me a nasty name so i now have the right to batter you senseless hmm
could use some colour why would a series set in rural england need to use some colour would we need a a of sympathetic white characters in a remake of alex haleys roots if ive got the sense of lennys comments wrong why havent you corrected me
and you deliberately divert and miss the point doesnt matter who is the villain and who the victim its the concept i expect your next post will probably be a godwin
you need to get that full stop key fixed mate i know how you feel so do i
he was only saying what the majority of us think really are you sure or are you extrapolating what you think or possibly the local saloon bargolf club express to the other  million folks in the uk let me guess youre a ukipper
a good post your grandmother of course would be roundly abused for speaking like this in our times my dad served with gurkhas he told me you could tell them apart from japs because despite their slit eyes they werent yellow they were darker he racially separated them but contributed to their welfare fund until the day he died i heard him described as having racist attitudes once or twicehe laughed and laughed hed seen the real thing close up
i thought he was until these very disappointing words
its a bit like the spanish inquisition that was the one that targeted jews for trying to succeed in a christian society right thank god that no longer exists
i think it depends on who you are doesnt it
i thought i already had sorry
unfortunately i can only recommend your post once
this is what i mean he implies that everyone speaks in this way to justify and minimise the offensiveness of such words
well said both and thank you
you heard him factoryset swissmissed is a busy manwoman
to defend political correctness you use the equality argument but equality is often overruled by diversity or multicultural arguments
strangely one of the great triumphs of the liberal left in the s and s was the end of deference nor more unequal ideas that respect is earned no more would we have to take care in choosing our words about politicians royalty the church or any other religion for that matter the once respectable middle classes and professions the armed forces the police boring vanilla white heterosexuals menall fair game for lampoon humour and mockery without quarter only to be replaced by those who must not be offended under any circumstances on pain of media opprobrium risk to livelihood or even prosecution political correctness is the new enforced deference to a new oppressive can do no wrong collection of approved groups and economic inequality remains untouched real power remains untouched the triumph of the left is a wonder to behold
pc brings decency to the superficial level it isnt what you say but the way that you say iti call my black friends coons and they respond with honky we laugh but we really laugh at the sanctimonious gobshytes who are offended we love to offend them because the are scum and are descended from those gobshytes who used to have people burned at the stake for saying the wrong things about the official faithfuckemall i hope pc parts catch a virus which kills them slowly and with extreme pain i hope that all those who dont agree with this  also suffer the samethere ive said it knighthood please
youre talking to a brick wall
freedom of expression and thought are fundamental to the protection of society from our ruling elites the moderation of expression and the acceptance of others is the obligation of each individual and is a personal duty that most of us have been taught by our families and schools however the needs of society are more important which is why we were all taught to accept that these freedoms of expression may upset us through tales such as sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never harm you
by transient biological arrangement i had in mind things like surrogate motherhood asking an acquaintance to w into a cup so you can create a baby etc
an acquaintance used to talk about her mother amp stepmother i commented that a close friendship between them was a little unusual she explained that her stepmother was not her fathers wife but her mothers new partner there is no word to describe this role the women met when she was an adult and mums partner was never her mama or mummy
a conception applied equally perhaps rather than if my opponent says it it is authoritarian if i say it it is not
well then the notion of compulsion is just some figment of the imagination and why its just lazy to infer from precedent its lazy or dishonest to insist that this is either an inevitable outcome of such arguments above or that this is what the author himself is calling for if it was the inevitable outcome of the arguments made we would expect there to be widespread examples of it and multiple attempts to introduce similar legislation there arent that the whole concept is authoritarian rather than the carrier of the opinion presenting a view smacking of authoritarianism also a lazy point absent of any specific calls for compulsion it is not an authoritarian argument
i will almost certainly bring the wwrath of hades down upon my head for me i see that latent children have more rights than aspiring parents of whatever gender or sexual orientation and it is not therefore a notyet parents right to engage in scientific intervention or to deconstruct society in their own image whilst true that nature makes us all and i certainly have no antipathy toward what anyone wants to do themselves it is also true as demonstrated above that men cannot bear children whilst women cannot have them without the intervention of a male consequently all methods and procedures that subvert that subvert nature the english language is quite adequate sorry
well as a gay adopter with a wide set of gay adopters we know from going through the process together our children all call us dad both of us biological link or notour two are very matter of fact about it all saying things like we have two dads x in my class lives with his mum and dad  but has dad  on the weekends but poor y in your class doesnt have any dads and so on
no must is a logical deductionif all greeks are hairy and toni is greek the he must be hairy if the first proposition is factually false then that is another thing solanguage always changes adapts to new ways of living therefore language must change adapt to recent changes in the way we live so which part is logically or factually false as for your telelogical treatment of nature i dont think it helps us explain the extinction of the dinosaurs let alone human cultural evolution
only in the narrowest of conceptions
yep the nazis stalinists north koreans and cubans did and are doing that it seems it is not agood thing at all
language evolves on a needspratical basis family units exist overwhelmingly on a biological basis to contrive and prematurely impose a nonbiological universal classification will result in popular rejection and derision the upshot is that so nonbiological family units will have to deal with prefixes step biological etc for the foreseeable future
thats one bill in one country its not replicated elsewhere samesex marriage hasnt led to the imprisonment of those who wont refer to someone as husband jesus christ i hadnt even seen this reply until just now are you having a laugh oh its only one bill in one country oh well then the notion of compulsion is just some figment of the imagination and why its just lazy to infer from precedent one neednt engage with the argument for it is merely censorship or authoritarian and therefore can be then dismissed without further thought why sure thats been my whole object from the beginning here that the whole concept is authoritarian rather than the carrier of the opinion presenting a view smacking of authoritarianism making me suspicious of the means that he supports sarc off
false parallel either the use of these words inherently involves an element of compulsion or intent towards compulsion or they dont
sorry ann fisher as in a woman who started this my sainted aunt
oh so whats next liberal censorship so that we cant use the word mother
we need a government committee to impose standards of behavior on us
we call them assholes not biological tyrants by putting all heterosexuals in one camp the author has provoked outrage perhaps were talking at cross purposes since i was referring to my point in my original comment not the concept of biological tyranny although that phrase wasnt talking about heterosexuals so any outrage ensuing is severely misplaced youll note of course that i have less political power than a graun writer perhaps so but then most guardian writers dont have political power sufficient to compel people to do what they want either if the author had wanted to publish a more reasonable article how about just urging the adoption of such words thats what hes doing absent of specific calls for compulsion to say something must be done is to urge change not force it as written it sounds like the author wants to end the use of classical terms to describe family members and it sounds like he wants us all to comply the conclusion explicitly says otherwise that neither refutes nor adequately justifies his absolutist position which you are tacitly admitting is his actual position rather than a slip of language this is doubleplusungood or at least plusungood oh well if you reference orwell there must be something sinister in all of this but as i said you asked why he explains why but again hes not calling for compulsion cast around what weasel language is this now well i would imagine if you had a more convincing basis upon which to find fault with the article something which actually was linked to the specific argument made youd have done so i reiterate my earlier comment since you chose not to answer it i did i pointed you back to the article in which the answers can be found and the point and it is contained within the article is that if others refuse to acknowledge specific family units that do not form the traditional nuclear family if others question or ignore their existence if the laws or social mores undermine their attempts to do so it makes it far more difficult to live without restriction
false parallel i should assume his use of must and abandon in a published article was a oneoff i suppose
i agree that we need to adapt our language now that so many families dont follow the traditional structure and if you consult family trees they never really didi dont agree we need new words we just need to be less prejudiced in how we apply our existing onesthe key word here i think is mother which is still widely used to mean biological parent who is the primary carer we need to move to using parent to mean the primary carer the person who does the childraisingeven in the guardian a progressive and modern media headlines still often use mother when they mean parent and by doing so unwittingly exclude the fathers grandparents and others who are doing the primary carer role the article is about
this is the definition of a liberal middleclass suburban problem even the children are called oliver lucy and george
sex and gender are so massively correlated that you cant separate them yes there are exceptions but in the vast vast majority of cases theyre two sides of the same coin the notion of gender as a social construct is completely unfounded its a biological construct clearly and overwhelmingly men express their gender as men and women express their gender as women a tiny minority choose to adopt some of the traditional gender expressions of the opposite gender but even in this case its quite clear that the gender expression theyre moving towards is laid out by the normative groupings a very tiny subset of this tiny minority claim to exist in an intersex limbo with a gender of their own invention but at that point theyve widened the definition of gender so far that it ceases to have meaning
and once again if you mean to say easily lead then it is easily lead
hes like a buster gonad queen bee hidden away in the cellar with his massive plums ready to burst out a load of fertile love fat when called upon
your embracing eugenics shows total disregard for the childrens future emotional assessment of their family situation and you will only drag the tiny and selfobsessed minority with you
take the comment that says i pity the poor children for a start or the one that said that minorities are looking to destroy the family theyre not difficult to find we call them assholes not biological tyrants by putting all heterosexuals in one camp the author has provoked outrage maybe this was his goal if so good job you used the word dont both are commands both absent of any means of compelling someone to follow them youll note of course that i have less political power than a graun writer but i certainly did use the word dont and i meant it dont publish things with an orwellian cast if the author had wanted to publish a more reasonable article how about just urging the adoption of such words or just describing how extended structures cope linguistically perhaps people would have taken up better with such a perspective as written it sounds like the author wants to end the use of classical terms to describe family members and it sounds like he wants us all to comply the article explains his case whether or not you agree with it he gives examples that neither refutes nor adequately justifies his absolutist position which you are tacitly admitting is his actual position rather than a slip of language this is doubleplusungood or at least plusungood some people would just call it ungood i guess whats the social dysfunction in the column youve cast around for one example and used that as evidence that despite no calls being made within the article all roads lead to that one example cast around what weasel language is this now anyway bill c we that tyrannous biological set see where the road is leading to youre going to criticize foresight now i reiterate my earlier comment since you chose not to answer it who is restricting your language or conceptuality who is preventing you from using the words you choose to use what biological tyranny is this ffs
therein lies the problem with gay marriage there has to be three people in the marriage if a child is to be conceived that doesnt really have anything to do with samesex marriage though assisted reproduction is used more often by straight couples yet there is never any reference to the invalidity of their marriages as a result
seriously why would anyone want to call themselves a north london housewife if they werent
its easily led failed gcse english did we
they could still get married as long as they procreate with a donor as not to produce what was called in the olden days an idiot before i get deleted these are facts of lifeincest i never forget the day i was about ten having just moved to a new place when i remarked on the two rather perplexing girls next door roughly my age what do you expect my mother asked thats what happens when a brother and a sister have babies my mother calls a spade a spade even if at the time i didnt know what she meant u
true just calling someone uncle doesnt make him a molester
its a pity they still call the mother of my children mrs  rather than msmiss hersurname even before we separated she was never mrs 
lets introduce another term for that contribution promoter
in a medium sized british city the thing about school admin is that we know stuff about families that the other families dont necessarily know people still dont always feel able to shout it from the rooftops if they are a single mum with their girlfriend living with them but the school needs all the emergency contact details so people tell us everything i dont think that figure is massively unusual from looking at various national schoolrelated data
i think the author is trying to challenge the presumption that nature consistently trumps nurture the problem is that without knowing the genetic makeup of the two individuals involved the conception of a child might be inadvisable i suppose there is always genetic testing but reducing conception to a laboratory procedure doesnt do it for me therein lies the problem with gay marriage there has to be three people in the marriage if a child is to be conceived or possibly even more i am not comfortable with the notion that women are merely incubators and men are merely sperm donors i dont buy the idea that nurture trumps nature i seem to recall a recent article describing how twins in the us who were separated at birth met up at university and subsequently married they had problems conceiving so attended an infertility clinic where they underwent genetic testing to see what the issues might be they and the doctor were shocked to discover the relationship neither set of adoptive parents had been aware of the existence of a twin brothersister apparently the siblings were immediately drawn to each other when they met implying a deep spiritual bond despite the different upbringing and lifestyle they were not alone as the tv programme long lost family frequently demonstrates sadly in some families that geneticspiritual bond is broken perhaps the fantasies created in the years apart dont match the realities but then if siblings are not aware of the others existence there wont be any fantasies
personally i dislike both terms but i was keen to show how language shifts and battle is made over those words with the outcome being unpredictable lost count of the arguments i had with people over the use of coloured people i can see why the man was castigated by some because the origins of the two terms are very different but it only reveals the intellectual paucity of the people of colour radicals a neoliberal antiracism which i have little time for but i am not going to defend the use of coloured people and would have suggested a gentle rebuke rather than moralising as if this would have any real impact on entrenched racism i dislike the word blended family too seeing little point in labelling and emphasising differences between two family forms but that is what the article is all about time to involve ourselves in relabelling or maybe unlabelling close relationships
quite
dont think that was much like this either
personally id like to see a much wider understanding of family entirely one which recognises a wider range of relationships than those centred on reproduction alone biological or otherwise it should be entirely possible to be acknowledged as a being a family even if there are no children involved childless or childfree people whether by choice or not and their significant others whoever they may be also deserve social recognition equal status and acceptance
i rather like the indian tradition of calling significant adults regardless of whether or not there are family ties uncle or auntie but it seems to me that our own society has become so suspicious of anybody and fearful of often imagined predators that it will become even more buttoned up that it is now
excellent post and probably the summation of all relevant issues here btl pick
interesting points here well put
i doubt my partner would agree to calling me a sixtyyear old his girlfriend dont think id like it either i am not a girl
point to any evidence that references this impact on worldview point to the hint of such an appraisal thankyou take the comment that says i pity the poor children for a start or the one that said that minorities are looking to destroy the family theyre not difficult to find must you used the word dont both are commands both absent of any means of compelling someone to follow them why then must their word we abandon these supposed binary restrictions the article explains his case whether or not you agree with it he gives examples the world has a wider frame of reference than one column but one column can give an indication of the onset of wider social dysfunction whats the social dysfunction in the column youve cast around for one example and used that as evidence that despite no calls being made within the article all roads lead to that one example
his objection being to the enforcement not the pronouns as such precisely as an organic change fine on threat of penalty never and that constitutes the entirety of his protest as usual though there are an innumerable number of the confused and disoriented who have taken the entire message the wrong way
if you cant stand the heat stop living your life in a perfectly reasonable way are you seriously suggesting that the solution to people asking rude and intrusive questions is to break up families
i agree with your making hard work of something that neednt be since you mention first names my son calls me mama but funnily and how that came about i have no idea has always called his papa by his papas first name twenty five years on one may of course if one were a tortured soul speculate on why this is but what the hell however re your second paragraph i have to say its rather nice to be called mama anyone can call me ursula but mama there is only one who can call me that and that is mega special u
andor when some one or more people come up with new wordsterms that are catchy enough to stick and enter the general language granted begrudgingly in the example of selfie and the like
of course we do id like to see partner redefined for a start
there are many spurious objections being made here most of which seem to be more concerned about how it might impact them or their worldview refusing to call my husband a husband isnt borne from anything that affects them personal just a lack of desire to acknowledge that this is now possible point to any evidence that references this impact on worldview point to the hint of such an appraisal thankyou point to the specific reference to compulsion point to the hint of compulsion lets see families have evolved now language must too must from a source like the graun this has a dire suggestibility to it the idea is not so much to redefine the roles of father and mother although such redefinition occurs constantly as historical contexts shift but to abandon the binary restrictions those roles impose curious phrasing there then abandon seems very absolute very final very complete why must we all abandon these restrictions and who defines them as restrictions and why more below the ship of heteronormativity isnt sinking why then must their word we abandon these supposed binary restrictions and lets go further for just a moment here restrictions who exactly is restricting your language or conceptuality who is slapping you down for not putting the description of familial relations in atypical arrangements into a conventional parallel tell you what find a hint of that if you can and not this posting no intellectual disjunction here thankyou and more broadly bill c the world has a wider frame of reference than one column but one column can give an indication of the onset of wider social dysfunction my suggestion is simple and follows use whatever words you like if it catches on great the second you consider something further congratulations youre a fascist
the claim was that a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family this is the vast majority of most families it is in fact  of families with with dependant or grown up children including cohabiting couples some one parent families will be relics of a heterosexual couple which means theyre not a two parent family even leaving aside the race issue the statement is wrong this is not the majority still less a vast one  of families in the uk are either married couples without children civil partner families cohabiting opposite sex couples with no children cohabiting single sex couples with or without children or lone parent families

societal expectation to call a family friend aunt society doesnt really care and familial neither did my family sorry if yours didyou could call a judge hey you outside of work but a tribal elder works  think of it as like a queen if thats easier i find your inability to recognise that disgusting by the way it shows a white centrism clearly you dont see tribal elders as performing an important role the difference you should recognise between a council of elders and a queen though is that the council will easily cast out someone if theyre doing wrong by the tribe and they have throughout history nobles will sometimes do that but only if they have power maybe thats why you dont trust a council of elders and seek to disparage indigenous culture
i may not agree with you at least not in the next  years but i have certanly enjoyed your prose and it is a view which has to be seriously taken into account
marriage between cousins is allowed in relatively few specific communities in india in the majority of communities it is explicitly prevented by tracing back ancestral roots to make sure people are not closely related to each other ie no marriage between people from the same gotra or clan
you have any proof that every other culture which has a different way of handling child rearing causes higher infant mortality rates and laid back attitudes to rape no i didnt think so
yes plenty of cases in family law
i think youd be surprised at the numbers of families that are not described accurately by traditional language on the other hand i will grant that using traditional language does provide a cover of privacy particularly for young children what are you talking about look male and female covers that vast majority of all people and notably the majority of trans people are very clear that they too want to be a male or female not a gender neutral penguin only a tiny minority of a tiny minority feels they dont fit into male and female and even then this seems to be based on very tight gender roles that disqualified them from being male if they like pink honestly i think you would be surprised how few families are not covered by the traditional language i think that you have been made to think this is a bigger problem by reading papers like this where they are blown out of proportion
you dont even have words for mothers mother or mothers father ditto for the other side theyre all lumped into one very strange
its easily lead if thats what you mean to say
so introducing a few new words to reflect the reality of many families is too complex for you seriously
i wonder how the offspring of unconventional relationships fare through adult life i ask in a spirit of enquiry not criticism im sure there must have been studies articles or documentaries but none that ive come across well right now in northern ireland i suspect these children would be having problems belfast either side of the peace line is not islington
sometimes better a same sex couple has to discuss having children prepare for it plan it and pay for it hence in most cases the children are the offspring of upper middle class couples and are very wantedthats not always true for heterosexual couples
meanwhile there a new bill in canada c that may actually force people to begin using genderneutral pronouns or create such an atmosphere of fear that all people begin using such pronouns in order to avoid even the accusation of bias ironically by actually biased parties and prof jordan peterson thinks that he could loose his job as he refuses to use these enforced c pronouns google jordan perterson his objection being to the enforcement not the pronouns as such
many studies and they do well as their counterparts of straight couples
and also that you cant spell because its actually easily led english not your first language is it
your username makes me think you must be extremely naive
i wonder how the offspring of unconventional relationships fare through adult life i ask in a spirit of enquiry not criticism im sure there must have been studies articles or documentaries but none that ive come across
im sure youre making a witty and relevant analogy i cant quite think what though
maybe brave new world and not 
we hear much about the reality of broken heterosexual families divorce and the like and this seems to matterare there ever broken samesex families because these are never mentioned
i am happy for your children to decide what to call you please dont make it a legal necessity for the rest of us to memorise all these names i have enough problems already
biological relationships are clearcut and precise the point is that theyre not in this context the only thing clear cut is that a male gametes and a female gametes led to the conception of a child it tells us nothing about the legal or social relationship the person those gametes come from will have with the resulting child nor does it dictate what the relationship should be by way of an example were anonymous sperm donors really more of a father than the man of the couple to whom it was donated would the child see that person as their real parent this isnt a clear cut issue nor is it a niche one there are many various family formats and this will continue to increase insisting that theres only one true and clear cut concept of what a parent is a biological one is increasingly unsustainable and as it goes already acknowledged in law so not quite the hurdle some claim

and yet the nuclear family is a pretty rare concept historicallynever trust anyone who pretends that culture is nature
actually if you read the article the author wants more than mum and dad he wants words for example for the surrogate childbearer who is still in contact with the biological father and his spouse
not just liberalism conservatism too apparently if i meet the queen im not allowed to call her mrs windsor i must say your highness or majesty or whatever im not up with all this political correctness
something like  are in gay or lesbian nuclear families seriously where is your school i was bought up in northern ireland and though this was a long time ago even today i imagine the numbers in ni are vanishingly small
tyranny ha
the author merely wants to embrace that complexity and not promote the colourless dystopia you have invented for yourself i was rather looking forward to the adverts from infantsrus offering a range of carefully pricepointed genetically engineered babies with desirable psychological characteristics available in diversely fashionable colours with certificates guranteeing that they have been incubated in medicallysupervised drug and alcoholfree broodwomen fed on soylent green all this producing the next generation by getting up the stick after a quickie on the nightclub dustbins is as outmoded as growing ones own vegetables
i very much doubt your experience amounts to this in any way i disagree it seems to as do some of the comments there are many spurious objections being made here most of which seem to be more concerned about how it might impact them or their worldview refusing to call my husband a husband isnt borne from anything that affects them personal just a lack of desire to acknowledge that this is now possible but dont start a rallying cry to compel acceptance and dont publish articles and consider too the host of the article here with such rallying cries point to the specific reference to compulsion point to the hint of compulsion its not there its asking you to extend your worldview you can ignore this as many have indicated that theyre more than happy to do so there is no compulsion any the more that your command dont can be taken to impose an obligation on anyone if thats not authoritarian in nature and its not articles like these arent either
good to see so many people here getting into a lather about the tyrann of being asked or forced to accept that others might want to live different lives to their owntruly an evil dystopia
what makes you think im old your username
or a whale very like a whale
we should also question the tyranny of biological relatedness the author objects to biological relationships for the same reason that similar guardian commentators talk about gender instead of sex and about how people identify themselves rather than what they actually are biological relationships are clearcut and precise what could possibly be more irritating to someone who wants to remodel reality so he fits in better the vast majority of people are just biological men or women im biologically male nothing more or less i dont identify as a man because that phrase is meaningless to me i dont identify as anything im just a man the vast majority of families have two adults one man and one woman they have and raise children who are biologically theirs people who dont belong to that very significant majority can do what they like as bourgeois society allows but they cant expect to try and change everyone elses reality to fit the one they imagine for themselves
i object strongly to your repetitve use of the word my implying oppressive neoliberal forms of ownership of property share options and garden furniture when other people are forced to survive on a mere  matabele beans a da ok thats more than enough of that thank you very much
english is already a bit limited when it comes to single words for common relationships for example how about a single word for the father of ones son in law or mother ditto or the parents of a daughter in law surely these deserve better than a clumsy phrase despite the obvious utility of a single word for each these it has never emerged how much less likely then that succinct words can be found and widely adopted for relationships that are themselves relatively uncommon so good luck with that suggestion and be sure to ring me if something turns up
i object strongly to your repetitve use of the word my implying oppressive neoliberal forms of ownership of property share options and garden furniture when other people are forced to survive on ok thats moe than enough of that thank you very much
changes in the english language tend to come from below ironically its the most marginalized people nonwhites immigrants and nonnative speakers who are transforming and enriching the language englishs slippery linguistics are its greatest strength eventually the familial definitions solomon longs for will bubble up in spontaneously in social media and popular culture its a problem that will solve itself
thats weird its more hippy than posh although i suppose there is a fair amount of overlap
the devolution of family has certainly set up several conundrums language being one of them
as to the idea that this stems from a small minority who want to demand the world bend to their image from my experience some of those with the biggest issues or objections to the idea of two husbands or two mothers etc are those who object to there being others in the world that dont reflect their own expectations of what is right and proper i very much doubt your experience amounts to this in any way meanwhile there a new bill in canada c that may actually force people to begin using genderneutral pronouns or create such an atmosphere of fear that all people begin using such pronouns in order to avoid even the accusation of bias ironically by actually biased parties my experience is that there are indeed people altlefters confused millennials who would be only too happy to lay hate charges against others for failure to comply one prosecution will again drive that atmosphere of fear and terror by all means use whatever terms you like and they should be accepted but dont start a rallying cry to compel acceptance and dont publish articles and consider too the host of the article here with such rallying cries use mommy and mommy or daddy and daddy or mommy and mom and daddy but dont write opeds talking about the tyranny of the norm as if people walking down the street had something innately against you
i think you make an important point words differentiate because theres an important social distinction being made either in suitability for marriage or claims on affection and involvement i think the problem with the article is that the author wants there to be no social distinction and yet different words
im not sure youre right lepharaon there always seems to be language that is unusable in certain situations such as at work or loudly in public you could certainly have lost your livelihood if youd used fuck too often at work  years ago depending on your job of course just as you could if you used nigger now go back  years and racist words were no problem common even but you get sacked if you said jesus or something similar
which book was that in i dont remember the one in which parents in unconventional families struggled to find the best way to describe their relationships to their children
and my father never had a birth certificate being adopted privately as would have happened on which fact is getting in my way of getting an irish passportcitizenship which i want post brexit and my father was from dublin i think
meddle how i didnt see anything in the article about that at all
i can see the problems set out here but why not just set out some useful suggestions for answers these things have to emerge from usage you cant expect someone from the oed to rock up and hand out a new set of words to use
most of my students learning say that there are too many words in english for family members they tell me in their languages you just call everyone cousin
got it the wrestler is a woman oops wrong article
i work in a school and i have a certain amount to do with pupil data management so i come up against these issues quite often i would say that something less than half our children are in conventional heterosexual nuclear families with both parents maybe  something like  are in gay or lesbian nuclear families maybe  are adopted from care maybe  single parents with or without stepparents living with them and a handful of more unusual arrangements the heterosexual nuclear family is therefore one of the two most popular arrangements but still an overall minority
so the writer correctly points out that they has been used as a singular pronoun since chaucer and then goes on to pretend that it is a new controversial invention in the uk at least one tends to use they when the gender is not known or irrelevant in my experience is the writer suggesting that even when we know the gender of the person about whom we are speaking we should write they might be a little bit clumsy if youre trying to identify whether the man or the woman you are talking about did something
this is true done this for years
solipsistic and thus ultimately pointlessi think this is a big discount of the many who feel language doesnt quite cut it for them and their experience of the world wittgensteins proposition what we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence is surely apposite as regards the exclusion of the other in and through language this exclusion is ideological and political
emilycricket why do you need to know the persons gender in most situations i cant see why that is necessary i know and you not alone in this which is why i posted my comment
seriously you find it confusing
ive done this for as long as i can remember others were doing it hundreds of years ago httpsenwikipediaorgwikisingular_they it makes sense alternating between heshe looks stupid
things become a little more tricky when you start using every and any which more often than not suggest more than one person might be consideredhere are two examples from sylvia chalkers current english grammar will everyone please bring their passports with them andif anybody calls tell them i am out this by the way has nothing to do with sex or gender
heesh commission some terrible articles
well women face having acid thrown in their faces in karachi for daring to not wear the veil they are forbidden to drive in saudi arabia and they are having their genitals mutilated in many countries but thank god that lorraine berry has picked the real issue to focus on
they is pretty inclusive but without definition where is the coverage of the election expenses scandal  mps have been elected on an illegal basis yet in the guardian nada youve lost any and all credabilty you ever claimed mere shills and hacks
yeah and sometimes the feminine nouns are bad things and the masculine nouns are good things which just goes to show how sexist the language is
i can see why the use of a plural pronoun they as a singular form could be problematic but i cant see how in and of itself that is a gender issue
this particular usage of they is pretty much from my generation onwards my english teacher at school would have had an attack of the vapours over it as i recall it first started after indefinite pronouns like somebody anybody and nobody when a gendered pronoun seemed wrong now it is firmly established even people that rage against it use it in their speech obliviously
do you know anything about the hellenistic towers in andros
correct two or more people therefore not a good replacement for heshe which are singular pronouns ps i dont care what google says or your hip dictionary tells you them be the rules
le soleil and la lune in french the other way round in english theres no distinction
well done for reiterating what the author said in their article
i heard you excellent point language can be an expression of sexism but it is not the cause lets not upset the applecart before we get the horse in front of it
what about them forrin languages what have all words male or female its madness no wonder that all parts abroad are swathed in mediocrity
not a big deal really your political correctness gone mad stance is simply out of place here
indeed i have never understood why people struggle with heshe or even worse intentionally use she to make a point the computer user logged in she entered her password what is wrong with they entered their password it is not clumsy it is exactly how you would express it colloquially the driver must always indicate before they manoeuvre wtf
i read a technical documentbook a while ago all written using the singular she when the subject was gender neutral far from it being liberating i found it jarring and artificial
the author isnt referring to gender of inanimate objects but references to the gender or sex of humans
historical reasons speak louder believe me
no you have missed the point you see if you say she had dinner with him then you are clearly implying that the first person is in a socially inferior position to the second at least according to the weird logic expressed atl
i dont really understand the problem some people have with this he or she is appropriate when referring to a specific person that you know the gender of they refers to a generic person or someone you dont know the gender of using he to refer to a generic person is very archaic and the only place i hear it now really is legislation where even companies become he
i write a lot most of the time they works as a genderneutral singular pronoun but sometimes it just doesnt and it looks wrong then i worry for a while before writing he and realising that i cant fanny around at work because i get paid by the word and if anyone complains i can use the defence of being a middleaged man
the article refers to the philosophy of john stuart mill that our language defines what we understand to be possible as a basis for the idea that changing language can change consciousness in contradiction to your idea that language is merely descriptive of discrimination and not also able to perpetuate it the idea true that a language has no feelings or opinions is not to say that it cannot enact sexism as you yourself acknowledge in the first paragraph of your comment while it is true that this article focuses on english and cherrypicks other examples and it is also true that it only considers a way forward for englishspeakers without necessarily setting out that focus clearly for the reader a form of cultural insensitivity as you say it is not obviously a complete fallacy that the romance languages can be considered inherently sexist nor precluded that some of them might not evolve to reduce gender presumptions in speaking of people even while maintaining the concept of grammatical gender to describe nonanimate objects and concepts which in itself isnt sexist at all even in the terms of the authors argument in relation to your last paragraph no idea the media should make no mention ofgender race eye colour or height really what does engaging in identity or gender politics actually mean what role models based ondivisive attributes does it push what does that mean and by demonises do you mean gender for example itself is demonised
german speakers wouldnt have a problem with it
i think theys talking shite but we would say that wouldnt us
the he thing has never worried me as a woman but they has been widely used for a very long time already
any chance of calling a halt to see what i did there its use suggests a lack of self confidence on the part of the writer protecting themselves from the anticipated lack of wit of the reader see how easy it is to avoid
i hate it when writers alternate between he and she it just ruins the flow of language to make an unrelated point english does not have grammatical gender but natural gender i think the author might be getting muddled up with gender studies the choice of pronoun relies completely on how we perceive an individuals sex not on grammar most indoeuropean languages have grammatical gender but the masculine and feminine have merged in most germanic languages dutch danish swedish and norwegian bokmal now have a common gender and a neuter swedish is a poor example of grammatical gender because it uses hanhon heshe for humans and sometimes other animals but dendet it for inanimate objects hen is of course an invented word based partly on finnish han but it also resonates with den which can be used for objects of common gender its kind of laughed at in much the same way ms is in english
language often relies on the reader being able to interpret context
change the name
this is the guardian after all
why do you need to know the persons gender in most situations i cant see why that is necessary
mwa people refer to their decidedly nonhuman cats and dogs as he or she all the time
left wing party in portugal just tried to change the rename of the portuguese id card from citizen card to citizenship card because citizen is a male word and its sexist im not kidding
separate sentences ignore the first
i know it wont happen in my lifetime but as long as we continue to use a language that is inherently sexist we will be forever perpetuating sexist ideology even without intending to language doesnt carry inherent meaning according to the later wittgenstein its meaning is a question of social or intersubjective agreement in the form of a language game this is why i view the lefts obsession with language as being somewhat solipsistic and thus ultimately pointless
i should have written their for her of course however there are some things too intimate for even a married couple
interesting in french its the opposite la lune le soleil maybe thats why they find it so difficult to get on
whats wrong with making language clearer to match an everevolving social context
being a very hierarchical language korean uses gendered honorifics and gendered kinship words even for nonfamily members in lieu of pronouns koreans use the first and third person pronouns much more than the second person which is considered too familiar even rude if its 너 nuh use of second person is done by close friends a senior speaking down to a subordinate or people about to come to blows
german also genders chairs trains and cups of coffee without asking them how they identify first so is it really a model to follow
they has been used as a singular pronoun since at least the th century and has been in common usage all my writing life  or so years
it is certainly implied read the headline and is currently thematic in the hothouse of anglosaxon gender politics i comprehend enough to get the underlying messageseemingly neuter is best the writer is plainly not a linguist
this is not a new ideaits been in use for yearsive used it since s university days
there is even more confusion in the us they would say xxxx is a good team whereas in the uk many would say xxxx are a good team
whilst speaking in hungarian is it possible to state that a doctor or firefighter is a he while the person working in a shop or in an officebased administrative role is a she if not thats a form of sexism that is prevented by language but no one is saying it will solve all sexism as your straw man strawperson sorry claims if yes then your comment on hungarian is incorrect
my french is poor at best but i believe  yes no depends on the animal depends on the animal always male happy to be corrected i dont believe although could be wrong that there is much suggestion that the gendering of words in french is sexist it appears moreso to english speakers because its such an alien concept to us
lorraine berry we still actually need to know a persons gender i dont want to have scan a text looking for clues just because someone cant be bothered to use he andor she because they think it is insulting or whatever the majority of people are cisgendered heshe therefore works very well for us and it will continue to do so leave the language alone
is it i use it and have only once encountered someone who called me one of them which i took to mean feminist or perhaps lesbian but since neither one of these insults me i didnt bother inquiring which he meant i am in my s so using miss also comes with other peoples prejudices as well the only acceptable pronoun to some would be mrs but that would come with the incorrect assumption that im married use the one that you want to use some people will judge you no matter what
they has been used as a singular pronoun since the th century or is that a bit modern for you
this is actually being taken seriously oh please this whole gender thing is getting ridiculous now men are sexists for being born male women are repressed for being referred to as she and people are even being labelled for having their birth gender and mental gender match up enough already
lorraine berry makes a good case they is very persuasive
what there is no gender distinction in firstperson pronouns english was this book in another language or did you mean thirdperson pronoun
old hat google singular they
oh you mean the singular pronoun that has been in use since the time of jane austen she uses it quite liberally in her novels
i have used they for many years in writing to get away from the doing he she or heshe in writing switching around on he and she to denote sex does make the writing difficult to read and very artificial however the use of gender when one is talking of the sex of someone is very very misguided and should not be encouraged in any way gender is an entirely a different concept from sex and feminists have done language a great disservice in promoting the use of gender to apparently cover sex i always mark my students down when i see this in their writing though i do explain to them why i have done so really feminism and woolly thinking go handinhand a lot of the time i suspect that feminism and its middleclass nature as expressed in the uk arguing for girls in the boardroom and so on is at the root of all this
as part of a liberal feminist grammarnerd circle of friends the long summer evenings must just fly by
sometimes i put the original noun in the plural so that i can use they instead of he or she eg instead of writing the user should enter his name here i write users should enter their name here
i tend to use they when talking about a hypothetical individual anyway unless there is a specific reason for it to be gendered sometimes we all instinctively lean towards the stereotype though
the word they is plural
yes i use they in this fashion all the time and no one has ever glanced and me askew as a result use this word when speaking to someone they will understand
total bilge just use she unless the gender is unquestionably male eg sperm donors people will notice your deviation from the norm and this is all to the good to use they is to create a messy confusion
congratulations on completing todays most outoftouchwithreality article
 referred to is correct
there is a problem with using they which is illustrated by the sentence underneath told barack obama they were non binarythat could mean the whole audience was non binary or maria and a friend or two or several were non binary a slight digression but we watched that programme thinking the questions would be political and mainly about ttip it was an amazing opportunity for students to question the us president what did we get from all these intelligent young people the video says it all
english is a language that consistently evolves according to need or in some cases fashion that this element of sexism hasnt been addressed simply shows that far too few people consider it a problem any proposed solution such as the once suggested wont work because it wont be adopted
i dont follow your example because daniel is familiar as you know their name assuming daniel is a he you would use he not they
are you arguing that vocabulary andor language does not influence ones thoughts and perceptions language flows from thoughts and perceptions you cant have a word for an entity or concept that doesnt exist
yep but maybe confusion and distraction from more important issues is the hidden aim
we have a non gender specific singular pronoun it we use it for inanimate objects could we get a bit more comfortable about using it for people
thin end of the wedge lynds thin end of the wedge
i was with you fully until you referenced your facebook feed i havent a clue what such a feed is unknown concepts distract me far more than divers uses of they
im in favour of women but i do not see how this change in pronoun may be good to themin german the word sun is female die sonne and moon male der mondits assumed that the sun is more powerful male than the moon and in germany however sexism is not greater or lesser than in britaina clearly innocuous proposal which will bring more confusion than actual dividends for the feminist cause
thinking completely outside the box here and probably being far too radical but how about we just treat each other with respect and get on with our lives or we could just endlessly and without any point just keep reinventing the wheel also you do realise that someone somewhere is going to be mightily offended being called they better reconsider
id never thought of ms as that i just thought its the choice of a woman who doesnt wish to give her marital status away surely it could be the solution if youve scrapped miss and mrs or are we scrapping mr too
i still remember the first book i ever read written entirely in the female first person pronoun i was well into my twenties it was striking and liberating as a female to have language stack in my favourgender it was then i realised language is a feminist issue thanks for the article
ive never really understood how gender in french works can anyone answer the following some may be redundant depending on previoussubsequent answers  do all nouns have a gender is it impossible due to the way the language is constructed to have a nongendered noun what gender is given to animals which may have a legitimate sex what gender is given to an animal where you dont know its sex what gender is given to a group of animals of mixed sex
doesnt everyone use they all the time in the manner you are suggesting anyway the use of he as the generic pronoun is almost always a sign of dated writing
he is correct if youre writing a book or a paper or something you should probably stick to this its not sexist no matter how much one might want it to be whenever i see this come up i always wonder if we might be having the same argument in reverse if the situation were reversed and the women were instead forced to share their pronoun while the men get one of their own or some such silliness they is less formal and generally completely acceptable consider for examplea chess player should usually endeavour to place his rook behind his passed pawnora chess player should usually endeavour to place their rook behind their passed pawn firstly there is no assumption that the chess player is male if you are making that assumption its your fault and not that of the language you are simply not parsing the sentence correctly to my ears the first is clearly a neater and more powerful statement while the latter appears clumsy and awkward likely because it is the numbers dont match i would use the former in writing and the latter in casual speech where detail and tightness are less important if i were speaking formally i would probably go back and use he the former as a result of being rarely used casually even sounds more formal and better suited to an instruction manual and as such carries more weight its also more powerful because youre not subconsciously trying to reconcile the singular player with the plural their finally consider the ridiculousa chess player should usually endeavour to place his or her rook behind his or her passed pawn its just insane why am i talking about chess well one of the greatest chess players ever wrote in english so correct and proper it seems to echo his playing style the first thing a student should do is to familiarise himself with the power of the pieces then in a completely butchered rewrite by someone presumably hoping to make some easy money and generate some selfpublicity perhaps this first sentence of chapter  was changed to the first thing a student should do is to familiarize himself or herself with the power of the pieces now the pronoun is dominating the whole sentence and the point which started out as learning to play chess has now been changed to some gender equality issue and the chess is taking a back seat i feel like if you didnt know what sexism was you would never consider he sexist similar to the south park episode where all the parents go nuts because all their kids are ostensibly racist and the kids have absolutely no idea what the hell theyre talking about having expressed my view on this imo nonissue i now eagerly await all the accusations of mansplaining
i know it wont happen in my lifetime but as long as we continue to use a language that is inherently sexist we will be forever perpetuating sexist ideology even without intending to hmm so english is a misogynist language used by misogynists male and presumably female too whether they are aware of it or notwarning academic integrity alert
being gendered is hardly individual
indeed in a world where german girls are neutral and french potatoes are feminine seems odd to say english is confusing on genders
you is ambiguous as it can be either plural or singular yes it is but im scots and up here workingclass scots do use a pluralised yous even when im speaking englishenglish i still out of natural habit will often use the pluralised yous when speaking of a group of two or more rather then the singular you for all instances nonworkingclass scots overwhelmingly use the singular you at all times though i have on odd occasions heard some of them do otherwise but its rare never can understand how englishenglish doesnt get around to using yous i suspect snobbery is at the base of it both for english people in general and for nonworkingclass scots
hasnt it been three decades since  i would love to still be in my twenties but alas
eh what its a very good example in the former we cannot confidently say what is going on ie who is pleased the team one of the women which one in the latter we know it is the first mentioned woman who is pleased
nope doesnt work the greeks tried it with katherevousa after independence tried for decades and decades anyone using katherevousa now is either being a pompous ass unbearably pretentious or a politician trying to fuck peoples heads upeveryone else speaks demotic greek
they do this seems to be a bit of a nonstory
thank you i thought i was losing it read the whole thing wondering when theyd get round to making that point i also use us meaning just me a lot in conversation at least but thats probably just lazy speech
i suspect they insist on a female doctor
ive been using they in this sense since around  or so

what
i read the article and agree with most of the comments on here
i dont understand how one week the guardian is telling us that language is fluid and things can mean whatever you want and stuff all those puritanical grammar nazisand the next were being told words or maybe its just some words hmm have concise meanings and woe betide anyone who missuses them goes off to look up confused in the dictionary
so that will be about  of the population who think you are talking crap probably more they are right

i went for a bike ride at the weekend with some of the boys thursday having breakfast in a cracking devon pub in ashprington if im allowed to say so the woman called me love and darling about every fourth word both of these are fine but yes of course the author is right an older man calling a younger woman a girl in almost any context is marking out the land he means i give the orders here love and i have the casting vote you dont and you havent i hope i dont do it and id be mortified if i did as for the farting bloke the author gets that right too i rather like him as he was embarrassed and bragging at the same time and she described it beautifully
people in manchester and a lot of other places in the north use the word love like a full stop they say it to everyone if you get upset about something like that then its bit silly

because my work sees me as the only man present meetings often start with right ladiesi usually just cough or say and man and the convener adds and gent
just trying to find out how people think on the matter no offence meant this ridiculous video went viral recently where an actress from the big bang theory went on a rant about how its not acceptable to call women girls because we dont call men boys which is obviously just a fib
now you understand
please dont speak for me betsy i find it unbelievably irritating
it was the funniest thing that happened to me all week unless that is the old fart did it on purpose and has a habit of doing it near princesses and then boast to his friends these princesses are so nauseatingly naive that tomorrow these old farts will throw up on them and they will still find it the funniest thing that happened to them
feminists speak for everyone
what a horribly sterile future we face the french have at least seen the folly of such neutering of the language lets hope good sense can prevail here
give your feedback on hun buns and babe
no its rhyming slang treacle trt dont want to offend
how about oi you
while we are cleansing the lexicon of offensive terms can we find a better name for a boyfriend who is older than 
no youre welcome
or when they refer to the victim of an attack as an old man of 
ill just stick with addressing women as oi you
cultural appropriation or something i think
i didnt mean as a collective noun i meant what term do you use to get the attention of a group within a class
trying to avoid third world solution
i think girls in the context of adults is more of a familiarity thing but i can understand how the presumption of familiarity is patronising i cant see too many of the shocked and outraged blokes in this comment section would fancy being called boy beyond the age of 
i dont know why this article has caused so much anger its an incredibly reasonable piece why do people have such a problem thinking for a second how the words they use might appear to others also how treating boys and girls differently might affect them but no instead people are straight on the anti pc posts part of the blame for that instant reaction should be borne by some of the more ridiculous and divisive articles in this paper but this really isnt one of those
you go girl
just call everyone the c word and be done
well hey you guys you gotta wear ties on a weekend is at least gender neutral i guess
other terms of endearment from scotland bawbag and fanny baws
i expect he enjoyed spitting in your soup afterwards
i would likewise agree that if the person in question asks other people to make him coffee but never makes it for other people hes a dick and if he only asks women to make it hes a sexist dick
at the ripe old age of  anyone under the age of  seems like a boy or girl to meid be flattered if somebody was to refer to me as a girl but i know its not going to happen too many grey hairs on showas for the use of luv darling etc they are quite commonly used in the north where i live but its mostly just a figure of speech and used automatically rather than as a deliberate attempt to put women down
whats with the interrogation herewe express attitudes through words it would depend on my relationship with the person involved our respective positions in the hierarchy etc
should i a male have been offended to be called flower by a stall holder on barnsley market a while ago i just thought it was a great example of local dialect still existing
bit weird
while your examples are entirely correct i fail to see how this justifies her condemnation of paul hollywood
my apologies sirmadamaaaaarrggghhhhh
perversely most hr harassment policies work in the opposite way with the perception of the person on the receiving end of a comment or behaviour being given priority over the intention of the alleged perpetrator
is twinkle okay
my mum who is  often says going out with the girls when referring to her female friends my wife  says exactly the same thing this is clearly an issue with the younger sensitive feeble generation but not a problem with anybody else i dont like the term snowflake but there really is a generation of somethings who need to get a bloody grip
in leicester midduck works for everyone and ducks
no they really arent people including men use the term girls to be informal and friendly
these terms are fine snowflake bae and fam however these terms should never be uttered by anyone ever
how about sugartits
i use sweetness when addressing male friends ref morrissey and also cnts as in bunch of or complete
im from the north where we call everyone pet dear or my darling regardless of age or sex i now work in london where itsdifferent i have adapted by calling all my male and female colleagues regardless of seniority sweetie its working well or at least i think so all my colleagues are equally confused and i think thats a win
there are worse things to be called i do not need to be reminded that i am a woman but quite like it when i can join the girls
what about would you like a coffee love is it the word or the task

we fellas should just call all women madam then there wouldnt be any problems would there
good comment
isnt everyone addressed as guys these days or have i missed a memo i cant use guys because the only brit with the licence was rik from the young ones
it depends on context and having a modicum of common sense however being told youve no sense of humour after being groped or demeaned is a particular favourite of mine
true though
ahem i think you mean hes a gender nonspecific article of genitalia
one guy at my work calls both men and women doll
girls and boys are nice terms men and women are useful ive never seen the point of ladies or gentlemen though theyre just class distinction terms used to denote breeding i never use either
oddly enough the women in my office refer to each other as the girls despite generally being in their s upwards as well as endlessly calling me other male colleagues randomfirsttime customers on the phone love and other such terms nobody bats an eyelid despite plenty of conversations about sexual creeps like trump etc perhaps a pinch of common sense and perspective helps gender terms can be completely harmless of not quaint even when used byaround people who deplore sexual abuse gender inequality etc
a common term of endearment in n ireland is to call another bloke big man as in howyadoin big man big man is used no matter what size the bloke is it is actually awkward when it is used with someone not from ni and when they are small in stature they dont get it at all another variant is young man which i have been on the end of despite my advanced years
and at the time he was very popular but we move on
i cant help feeling that theres something as sinister in young girls being called ladies as there is in women or ladies being called girls when i was growing up in the s ladies wore hats and women wore headscarves but all of them always had to be called miss or mrs something unless one of them happened to be lady something like mate or fella or perhaps bro for a black boy or hon or sweetheart or whatever all these appellations are a dig in the ribs a hint about the behaviour expected of the addressees at my allgirls school we had a gym teacher who wasnt a mere lady but an irresistible force a power she never raised her voice but her entry into an unheated gymnasium full of shivering twelveyearolds wearing only white singlets and navyblue knickers raised the temperature several degrees she always said good morning ladies in a clear low voice our teeth stopped chattering immediately our arms fell to our sides our spines straightened ive never in my life heard anything more sinister than that phrase uttered by a massive tweedclad presence good morning ladies
absolutely i like terms of endearment when the meaning is endearing up here in yorkshire you cant move for terms of endearment and mostly the context is warm connection aka friendlinessbut ive also witnessed love being used in a different context when its meaning was listen silly woman let me explain this to you because you dont have testicles and therefore have no idea about plumbing an altogether different kettle of fish this debate shouldnt lead us down the road where subtlety is lost as well as a welcome tinsel on our lexicon
sure fair but then its the tone or the general attitude thats the problem right rather than a word if a nonsexist male coworker addressed you as love in a friendly tone that would be fine
what happens if youre addressing a group of girls ladies or boys this is too weird
up here northumberland people get called pet or hinny however as we are not delicate little londoners with no skin egos the size of saturn and the sense of humour of a verruca no one finds it offensive in fact the biggest insult is to be called a southerner
something which is not intended to be offensive can still end up being offensive and thats not necessarily the fault of the listener
spot on come over to the old side dear where we dont remember names everyone is angel
is this one of those beatings will continue until morale improves scenarios
when is a term of endearment not welcome when the person its directed to is too egotistical antisocial and cynical to appreciate the intention behind it adults usually call other adults girls and boys in joviality love is not gendered and as long as its not said sneeringly why on earth would you turn it into a problem
youve missed the point catering is not a manly persuit and these tv chefs like hollywood where limp buicuits in their kitchen training days its all overcompensating and its a testimony to these ridiculous pc times that mollies like him are regarded as casanovas 
my husband is german and came to london thinking he would be allright because he had learnt english someone in london asked him can i help you love  he as german didnt know what to do du and sie he had never met her and he was love we laugh about it now no language course had prepared him for this i tell my grandchild that the wonderful thing is you can be called loveduck pet all part of the english way of being friendly this article makes me think i should reeducate him so sad
the women i work with dont talk down to me the tone wouldnt be patronising so i wouldnt mind it there are a couple of male dinosaurs where i work who seem to think its up to their female colleagues to do the teamaking organize leaving parties etc because apparently by virtue of the fact of being born with ovaries were good with that stuff i find that attitude condescending and massively outdated
im waiting for poppet to come back
no one in birmingham would ever call you duck youve overshot by about  miles
the letters of henry root 
sorry for any offence by using the word girlswhat i meant to say was young people choosing a hetro or homosexual female gender identity on that day because as we all know gender is fluidwombs testicles etc dont enter into it because gender is a social construct
theres a guy in my work who calls other men luv is that allowed or not
the former childrens mental health tsar natasha devon said she would not refer to pupils as girls or ladies because it is patronising she suggested that gendered terms are not useful and that boys as much as girls are constrained by them which could be why she is former
i hate it when journalist use girl to describe a  year old woman they never refer to a boy of  but i call my male students all sorts of things my dear love darling angel sweetheart my little precious they only complain when i call them trouble i have turned into my granny who called everyone love as she couldnt remember their names
why not just identify as a dr isnt that what everyone doing identifying as something
neither ˈnʌɪðəˈniːsubmit determiner amp pronoun  not the one nor the other of two people or things not either 
oh dear we all have issues some of us just get the fuck on with it
mx chrissydt love it dont think one would have to identify as genderqueer to use it would just need to be bored witless with the patriarchy heretofore known as the menz hasnt showed up on forms yet though perhaps need to write it on them to get the message across of course the better option would be to dispense with these titles totally except when somebody has earned it by being a medical doctor or has done a doctorate in something or rather
what a load of selfobsessed nonsense there are people dying from hunger in the world and your hardest decision is how to fill in an rsvp form no wonder pc gets a bad name
what are you talking about this problem was solved when the term ms was introduced over  years ago so that women did not have to declare their marital status or be ridiculed as a feminist if they put down ms are you serious when has that ever happened and all the women i know are quite capable of deciding for themselves what surname to choose when getting married or divorced which is by the way a different question anyway but then im not threatened by this article
as is mister derived from master 
how is that pronounced
personally i never use a title whether for myself or others apart from in writing formal letters requiring dear mrms etc in most cases i would use a forename simple really
tick them all bound to be right some of the time
you could just not tick any box
ms was brought in so women did not have to declare their marital status when filling in forms and the like it was not just for divorcees someone else thought that and im quite surprised to read that people believe this single women did not want to be miss soandso hence ms was introduced and everybody could use it it would have been a bit useless if it were only for divorcees in time i suppose there will be similar misunderstandings about mx
would it be inappropriate to suggest that you use the toilet appropriate to your plumbing it would because for some people toilet appropriate to your plumbing is a ticket to being harassed or beaten up by transphobes and i suspect somebody like buck angel using the ladies might not be an ideal solution either failing that affect a limp and use the disabled loo shifts the problem to disabled people
the author writes the addition of mx also represents a significant step forward for the feminist cause by decentering gender and providing a genderneutral option to the terms mrs and ms mx allows women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature i dont understand this paragraph ms was introduced so that women did not have to declare their marital status previous to that we had only the options of miss or mrs my patrilineal surname was given to me at birth and i have no problem with that married women choose to take their partners name or not as the case may be i dont see what the mx prefix has to do with patrilineal nomenclature am i missing something here
the owd just gave its seal of approval to amazingsauce as a word i feel so validated
white peoples problems must be tough
oh the horror
im still hanging for the to be an official salutation
i thought it was short for mexican
good idea
either and neither are plural not dual its fine
why should women denote marital status and not men
it
i and at least eight others cared
hmm yes i think youre right lets use i am not any of mr mrs and ms but i am mx any better suggestions
plus its for doing form letters which hold over many otherwise defunct salutations
weve already won mx is in the dictionary mx is an official part of the english language because the dictionary just reflects language as people use it hence for example the addition of twerking a couple of years ago it doesnt in any way validate the concept the word describes which remains the same selfabsorbed firstworld nonsense it always was
i had a bad headache and went to see to doctor unfortunately it turned out to be dr dre he just gave me some crappy headphones
unfortunately that doesnt work reliably i perhaps influenced by forty years in the society of friends dont want to use any title it works for my passport and driving licence but when i tried this on my australian bank for my credit card my uk bank is happy with just my name the choice was mr mrs miss ms or dr no chance for a blank perforce i had to pick dr as the only genderneutral option and have to soothe my conscience by telling myself that after all its a qualification not a title but theres a chance that i may have to explain that im not a medical practitioner a vet or a dentist why for goodness sake do we need titles at all
how about darth
i think the idea is to have mixed rather than segregated into malefemaleneutral so that gender wouldnt factor into where the person felt they had to go there are advantages to singlesex dorms and toilets not least that womens toilets dont tend to smell strongly of wee but a neutral option would probably be used by more people than you think id certainly opt for gender neutral facilities rather than queue in the ladies
you can call me lord voldemort
actually id like to be nothing at all no honorific like the quakers just the name not mr mrs ms mx dr lord lady the rev if were all equal of equal worth then who needs a title if there is to be true equality between the sexes then who needs to know if youre male or female i try time after time to leave that little box at the head of the online forms empty but i keep getting asked to fill it in or i with a very obviously female first name get letters addressed to mr   because mr is the default when the box is left empty perhaps i should start to go for the other option and fill it in grand panjandrum 
try doing that on a digital form it wont work you have to click something i always choose something at random dr rev lady etc
yes but if i see the marital status written on a piece of paper before i meet said woman in person it will decide for me whether or not i will try to seduce her i like married women
why not just get rid of these stupid pigeonholing honorifics completelyinstead of saying mrmsmissmrsmx smith why not just say smith
aha you get it p
more pc bullshit theres no end to it
it would also involve removing all of the standup urinals in the mens toilets and replace them with sitdown toilets in cubicles thereby making it much less efficient and making things worse for everyone or at least all the men like so much of this academic progressive bollocks its a combination of nonsense and things which logically screw things up for everyone
i prefer the title of harr from old english hearra
i have not chosen to be this tall yet i am paying over the odds for clothes a friend  and myself  both own a coat of the same style from the same store his is a large mine is a small if we went and bought the materials to make this coat his would cost more as there is more fabric involved but in the shops as a finished item we both paid the same amount for our coats same with tshirts or shoes so in reality shortarses like myself are subsidising your clothing youre welcome
perhaps you should try dating sites instead
yes it is the quakers im an atheist myself but for this and other reasons i do have a lot of time for the quakers yep same here they have a lot of things right their flavour of christianity is probably about as close to atheism as a man of foxs time could understand too
i dont see why people are so hostile to the idea if were going to have titles relating to gender it makes sense that we include one for people who dont fit the currently available options it doesnt affect anyone who clearly identifies as mrms in the same way that introducing ms had no impact on people choosing to be missmrs the fact that they are in a minority is irrelevant or should be i thought wed progressed beyond thinking that minority views are unimportant
why men dont need a different prefix as mr doesnt denote marital status ive always liked the french monsieur as it is derived from the french for my lord nicely egalitarian
well the author of it probably things so it would be hard to find a more selfreverential phrase than we of the left as if anyone cares
you say muh then you wink immediately
yes but does jacob get a favour or not mother of the bride would need to know please let it be a bride and a mother or this may go into a never ending loop of offensiveness
an earnest social worker told me around  that ms was the correct title for unmarried mothers and there i was thinking the whole point was that it didnt show marital status 
of course youll now start a series of columns about why binary choices for neither and either are so offensive to those who see life a series of tertiary choices
how do you pronounce this
seriously mate the guardian go from the penthouse to the shithouse all too frequently with rubbish articles like this
no it isnt otherwise we wouldnt need to deal with discrimination in the workplace and wouldnt have to know how many men and women we employ and yes i appreciate that is offensive to those who do not align with malefemale but the law doesnt yet poly as for any other gendersexual value
why does this entire discussion remind me of the classic song im a manyes i am then there is the great bb king tune paying the cost to be the boss
sorry mate but if youre a bloke then youre a mr its actually not your choice just a social convention if it was a matter of choice then we could all choose what to be called so lets stop bringing irrelevant shit into the equation
no too feminine sorry can i still say that ill have to give it some thought it needs to be something which reflects our grizzled experience combined with our menschy wisdom it could just be omg but i suppose that has been taken
as a nonalgorithmic person i find this remark offensive and flippant
is there a separate pronoun and title for the offensively patronising or those rushing to be offended i would prefer not to offend anyone and refrain from doing intentionally when it comes to gender and others but if someone wishes to selftitle then we may as well just ignore them until they rejoin normality while there is a need for intersex or bigendered the rest are artifices to satisfy feelings which cannot reasonably be catered for if we have mx then why not any other combination of two or three letters to cover any possible combination of appearance behaviour feeling and genitalia both original and achieved
mrss
msrs
grammar alerti cant be bothered to reconstruct that sentence but neither is wrong too
lol
this comment was totally mexico
selfrighteous nonsense just put na
dump all these titles or permit one to choose none of them
so if i use mx people will assume i am transgender or they will think i dont want them to know what i am i think it could confuse people but i always hated the fact men dont have a version for miss or ms
i grew up in italy and in the country nobody will ask you if you are miss or mrs beacuse people thinks your marital status is only a business of your and it belongs to your private therefore all women are mrs and it doesnt matter if you are married or not no woman changes her family name never ever therefore mrs or ms or mx it is not important the important is nobody dare to ask me if i am married or not in name of god
never mentioned sexuality wasnt going to as it is not relevant gender discussions are either directed towards lgbt debates or womens issues rarely if ever have i seen or read an article where a man debates whether the male approach is intrinsically either constructive or combative why is it that we are still debating in the st century whether women should be paid the same as men or why women cannot hold the same rank as men in many if not all religions these are just some of the examples that highlight the gender imbalance perpetuated by men who else
decades ago ms for women was intended as the correspondent to mr for men irrespective of marital status now it is regularly offered as an alternative to mrs spectacularly missing the point my application for online banking insisted that i also specifically identify myself as male or female regardless of honorific for what reason i cannot fathom much as i admire the coining of mx i really dont think it will catch on
it is to match your credit card details reduces the chance of credit card fraud by  if you cant confirm your recorded gender
i gender identify as an old married guy i think we need our own title too
be what you want but you cant be neither of three options
carry on pretending that its only conservatives who think its ridiculous
i have often wondered why it is so important for everyone to know what gender i am or if im married when i order some consumable online and its mr mrs miss mswhy what difference does it make i fill in a query for the local council and again mr mrsmiss mswhy when it is totally irrelevant to the situation there are very few situations where it could be of any relevance it will be a relief to use mx for the record i am an elderly person whose gender and status are nobody s business but my own
it would involve me pissing all over their floors
personally id like a term that showed respect but was not gender specifichowever mx next to my first name might sound like boastingthats mx willy to you
no one will be saying it in real life so it doesnt matter
and they are in use by a tiny tiny minority that in reality exist mainly on corners of the internet
aside from a few outliers everyone is assigned male or female some time before birth
surety if its gender neutral then it has n u rose and what you repay want is a gender neutral name
this is a thoroughly important comment
i think a lot of the antipathy and cynicism about it comes from the fact that theres no clear biological cause for it a lot of people think its narcissism a fashion statement that nhs link is interesting dawns story and from the comments at the above link this i am a  year old genetic male and have had gender dysphoria since before i started primary school one of my testes was undescended and was removed my worried parents arranged for me to see a psychiatrist when i was   my father said he had been told that my behaviour was because he was too strict i married and had  children i have since had gender reassignment surgery about  years ago aged  due to persistent high blood pressure i had an exploratory op that established i had congenital adrenal hyperplasia could this have affected the development of gender identity at the foetal stage im biologically unable to knit i cant sew either i also cant mend cars and struggle at putting up shelves im pretty much an ungendered failure in everything i do the only thing i can do well is drink beer and shout at the telly when the footballs on
biology doesnt make simple biological definitions on sex guevedoces for example httpsenwikipediaorgwikialphareductase_deficiency i used to work academically in the field of sex determinationit really is more of a continuum than simple biological definitions bathrooms may represent a easy way to classify people but it really is like drawing a line somewhere arbitrarily in a grey area
we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity have you seen the queues outside the ladies toilets you can have a third set of toilets for all i care but ill be damned if im waiting ten minutes to have a piss nomixedtoilets
grammar alert why did nobody notice i am neither mr mrs nor ms but mx get it right then you can talk about titles
no idea either thats one of the things that was puzzling me i dont think i do feel like a woman anyway anymore than i feel like i have blue eyes asides from the question of what being a woman is meant to feel like setting aside the obvious biology if i felt like a man and not like a woman how would i know anyway its not as though i know how other people feel about it to compare and if i was a man i think basically nothing would change about my life perhaps i wouldnt knit purely because my mum might not have taught me so i cant really understand why it would be so important the persons own personality surely matters more also find it surprising that the writer uses mx but is apparently fine with the jacob but its up to them
i think i would prefer it if general expectations of gender were different rather than creating a third nongender gender option i identify as gay male i would certainly have no problem people identifying as female or nongendered using the same loos as me likewise i would have no issue with using a womens loo they are all cubicles anyway so why does anyone care who is sitting in the next cubicle what i personally find much more problematic is that everything trains planes doorways are not made for people as tall as me at  if people who do not fit gender norms can have their own loos i want to have my physical size respected instead being forced into a near permanent crouch when traveling on public transport or walking through doorways i have not chosen to be this tall yet i am paying over the odds for clothes and wherever i go my physical environment reminds me that i am the wrong size so yes i do feel discriminated against
they their theirs
ze hir they zhe zer zir zhim mer hu hus ey em i could continue but there is so many of them and they are in use
the oxford english dictionary finally added the genderneutral title into their lexicon for genderqueer people the decision couldnt have come soon enough the irony of people not wanting to be labelled actively defining their own label is clearly lost on some people jacob tobia is a writer speaker and consultant committed to justice for gender nonconforming genderqueer and transgender people im surprised not to see selffacilitating media node on this list
what to put in the title box another example of the first world problems covered in the guardian
solve the problem of patrilineal nomenclature any more than ms does sorry comment accidentally posted before id finished writing it of course there are other great reasons for mx im all in favour but this isnt one of them
let me google that for me httpwwwnhsukconditionsgenderdysphoriapagescausesaspx
i agree it is unfortunately nonsense because the whole point of ms is that it avoids marital status and mx doesnt
i hope someone asks how to pronounce it
i dont feel i particularly identify as a male ive asked two other people now and all  of us have said the same thing i really dont understand the confusion the discomfort the anxiety about identifying with one gender or the other i dont understand how some people can want to switch genders so badly that the distress it causes can ruin their lives but i also dont understand how you can be unsure what gender you are or you can be most comfortable in some kind of limbo between the two the more i think about it the more confused i get help
well if you want to share you moniker with a former us icbm who should care
emecks
how do you pronounce it
i sexually identify as a habanero pepper and i use mx pronounced as mex
the oed isnt normative or prescriptive it simply includes words when they crop up in the source texts often enough and since the oed is so big and exhaustive that doesnt need to be very often at all
so what about other pronouns like he she him her his hershow do they become neutralised this only works for the simple reason that both female and male titles start with an m which makes the whole bloody thing ludicrous
about  hits and  for the exact phrase you should stay in more this article is hit  of  but it did then make me realise that when mx tobia says the addition of mx allows women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature its nonsense because the patrilineal nomenclature bit is the surname at least in a system where you normally get it from your father and thats left unchanged no matter what fancy title you stick in front of it
what a good laugh where do they get them from
or even frau dring
the different fixtures in the toilets means that men are much more efficient in terms of pph pees per hour throughput so if it was up to me and i had a choice id always go the mens route faster relief
i lold also
sorry to do this but this article is the stuff of nonsense anyone can identify however they please but the problem comes when they want to harass others to agree with or humor their choices if you dont want to use any particular title then dont simply leave the title option blank and request being addressed only by your name
it would also involve removing all of the standup urinals in the mens toilets and replace them with sitdown toilets in cubicles
laughed out loud one recommend is not enough
wish i could recommend your comment more than once i dont necessarily agree with the sentiment but it was fucking funny
no idea to be honest biologically i can produce the sperm half of the babymaking equation and its easier to pee standing up without hitting my feetotherwise i dont feel i particularly identify as a male i live my life doing things that i hope and believe my daughter could do too if she wants were quite similar actually i suspect if i started talking to her about gender roles and whether or not she feels comfortable talking about herself as female she would probably laugh at memind you shes only though id expect the same reaction when shes 
i think separate rest rooms for those who miss the target
best not to be too woollyminded about things
time for gender neutral marriage guess best man might be a problem though
how does it feel to be a man how does it feel to be a woman oh and the m question how does it feel to be neither i just cant get my head round that one
such delicate sensibilities
 we need governments around the world to create genderneutral options on identity documents we need colleges and universities to embrace genderneutral housing for all students we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity and more than any one of these structural changes we need to live in cultures that no longer make assumptions about who we are or who we want to be based on our genitalia or our sex assigned at birth  yes no no yes im very pleased that mx works for you its an elegant little pronoun and ill be happy to use it for anyone who wants me to though im not sure what it gives feminists that ms doesnt also give them but the idea that we should provide gender neutral restrooms for the very small number of people who are genderqueer is somewhat laughable and the idea that cashstrapped universities should offer genderneutral housing is even worse
like with any social change im sure that there are those who oppose the use of the term mx but im not too worried about their opposition because weve already won mx is in the dictionary mx is an official part of the english language mx is here to stay theres no such thing as an official part of the english language there is no authority dictating such things not even the oed they merely document what is totes amazeballs may well be in the oed it doesnt make it official and it certainly doesnt mean its here to stay
upbringing and our environment and the traditions and expectations of the wider culture
mux and mix are both correct according to oxforddictionariescom it only gives miz for ms about which there was similar uncertainty when the term was first invented
i am neither mr mrs or ms but mx of course you are dear so what are we having for dinner at this party ian
mx used to be stamped on mandrax branded methaqualone you would pronounce it quaalude
agree miss sounds young and foolish or oldmaidish would hate to use it
how does it feel to be a manhow does it feel to be a woman how much of what we think and feel and how we behave is a product of our biological sex and how much comes from our upbringing and our environment answers on a postcard or below
you know the sound you make when you sigh wearily like that
well surely it would just involve removing the male and female signs and replacing them with toilet signsdont need to build anything new
and they certainly wont use it
i couldnt care less how i am boxed by convention or lack of it i am not influenced or pushed by any outside pressure or reaction my expression comes from who i am not how i am categorised by others my identity is not determined by someone else
ultimately if youre a big bearded man who wears womens clothes and identify a genderqueer then yes youre going to struggle in public bogs and no they arent going to build a rd set of bogs for a microminority if youve been invited to a formal dinner party chances are theyve spotted that youre in a minority so scrawl none of the above on the invite
from here on i am using the mx option even when its not provided as an option i
i know the feeling i wish i could choose the womens changing rooms but alas ive been assigned male
literally no one is forcing you to go by mx or any pronouns besides the ones you want people who feel comfortable with ms and mr can still use them this is just another great option for someone who doesnt feel they fit into either
whatevah you pick
building a rd set of toilets for a microminority isnt going to happen all bathrooms have cubicles just go into the toilets that relates to your birth gender and use the cubicle i do agree that you should be free to select male female undisclosed
yeah but i really need to go to the bathroom quite urgently and i dont know which one to use
its not all about respect for many usage of first names implies a certain familiarity they might not want strangers have for them
wrote this article obviously
actually youre a dx
i must admit that ive always been a little puzzled by this as well i dont wake up every day and think that i feel like a man i dont even know what being a man or a woman is supposed to feel like so im not sure how id be able to notice the difference i would genuinely welcome an explanation of what being genderqueer even entails mentally speaking its kind of what i was hoping for when i posted an insight some kind of explanation i also dont feel particularly male most of the time like you most of the time i dont think about it but when im in the presence of other people ill sometimes moderate my behaviour in line with the cultural expectations eg make sure im not crossing my legs in a way that looks too feminine if im sat for a long while this applies especially in the presence of particularly loud aggressivelookingsounding men i might not think about it sat opposite someone who looks like a doctor id definitely be aware of it sat near a bunch of pissedup footie hooligans i go into mens toilets without thinking about it the idea of being confused about it sounds really strange and quite absurd although id happily go into unisex ones im aware of the fact that a lot most all of these behaviours are sociallyconditioned im not sure how manly id behave if i lived alone in the woods on my shopping trips id definitely be picking up lager not wine is that a manly thing to do its ok i know the answer lots of men prefer wine genders really confusing and im not sure how much of what we feel and how we act is a function of our biological sex i think a lot of it comes down to what were comfortable with and a lot of that is a product of our upbringing and our environment i still dont understand the toilet confusion though
how the hell do you pronounce it that would have been relevant information to include if you want people to recognise or use this term
the use of the honorific places a distance between you and the person you are ealing with we do not immediately start using someones given name and in a professional exchange do not need to
i pretty regularly use the genderneutral loos at my students union not out of any kind of gender thing im a bloke and i know it just because theyre pretty much guaranteed to be empty theyre curiously highdensity too about eight cubicles in about the same space as the gents which has three
for the better part of two minutes i stared down at the form in front of me i was attending a formal dinner later that week and the rsvp required i choose whether i was mr mrs or ms i looked at the question and froze unsure of what to do you wonder how you will answer a formal dinner invitation i wonder at what point people who receive formal dinner invitations began to think of themselves as marginalised it seems in the past twenty years there has been a thorough gentrification of who we think of as marginalised in society these groups used to be strongly linked to economic disadvantage but now were in a cultural environment where a guardian columnist not this one can call people with eating disorders the new underclass really not the homeless not addicts not the longterm unemployed everyone has problems of one kind or another but it seems that a lot of people seem to have lost all sense of perspective about them perhaps a starting point for this particular author might be to consider how privileged you are in global terms if you are a published writer who gets invited to formal dinners
perhaps because people generally feel more comfortable sharing facilities with members of their own gender and in the case of women probably also safer disabled toilets however are single user
for all the people saying this is ridiculous pandering or the favourite political correctness gone mad just dont worry about it youll never have to use it just carry on and pretend youre living in your conservative utopia
 there are many challenges that arise when you live your life outside of the gender binary like i do i never know which bathroom to use i dont know which section of the store to shop in and im frequently harassed on the street by people who dont understand my gender identity above all of those concerns the bigger issue that people like me face is that our identities are so rarely taken seriously thank god for first world problems
out of interest how is it pronounced is it mux
indeed no one has answered this yet
awkward
who is this humanity you speak of last time i looked most of humanity was obsessed with superstition and wouldnt cross the road to piss on someone they thought was different its only in the west that such opinions are changing and only then in particular parts of our society
do you know why they all have full length mirrors handy for me mind
mx is an official part of the english language mx is here to stay apart from silly shits like me who read the online guardian  of people will never have heard of the term
interesting how women have had this problem for many years if theyre divorced not knowing if to put miss mrs or be ridiculed as a feminist if they put down ms being looked at suspiciously if theyre still a miss when theyre older etc not knowing if they should still use the married name they had for many years after a divorce then as soon as a man or woman dont want to be a gender there are suddenly articles about titles
for many years i have commenced formal letters with dear given name family name eg thomas jones and have avoided an honorific this seems to me to be quite respectful in my experience the use of honorifics is declining in everyday life on the odd occasion i am addressed other than by my given name i am called mrs rather than ms my preferred choice though i have never used mrs in my life it is nonsensical to call oneself mrs when one retains ones maiden name on marriage i can only conclude that it is felt that mrs is more respectful of my age on a par with madame
we need genderneutral public restrooms that provide safety and privacy without separating people on the basis of gender identity i dont think many businesses or local councils would be thrilled at the prospect of having to install new toilets that might get used a couple of times a week
odd i thought ms mizz in american was the maritalstatus neutral womens title and that miss not normally abbreviated pronounced just like the word was the unmarried counterpart to mrs missus or missiz in american as for the need for a genderneutral title its  and im not sure the value in adding more to what is already an archaic mode of address while im a straight cisgender male wholl nottoobegrudgingly use mr if forced to check a title i usually leave the box blank and almost never have been called upon it i cant be the only one for whom mr surname evokes of a reaction of oh you must be looking for my father despite being firmly in the earlier part of my middle age
no thats goats
far from it for me to allow anyone to do anything do what you damned well like as long as it doesnt infringe on the rights of others walk down the street wearing a mongoose costume calling yourself herr von strictenstern if you pleasejust dont expect me to take you seriously or play along
if you want a pair of jeans that makes your arse look fantastic go to the womens bit hey thats discrimination as a male with a lovely bottom i too want jeans that make my arse look fantastic
thats exactly what its for i think the people who want this feel the same way you do about nonneutral titles its about being more inclusive if you identify with the gender you were assigned at birth then that is great if you identify with a gender not given to you at birth then great too hell if you dont assign or identify with any gender that is just as great as the other two the idea is to make everyone as comfortable with their identity as possible not to make everyone nongender or transgender
we humanity are gradually moving past the need for such titles this a title for one who doesnt fit the traditional labelling or who prefers no such title is a step away from our juvenile past for the present time it seems we need it until we are nolonger obsessed with ticking boxes on government forms
i am going to make a massive massive leap and guess this chap is an american
how do you say it who caresnobody is going to use it or acknowledge itif is in this case your name is jacob then youre going down as a blokepeople can identify as much as they like or in this case not and best of luck nothing says the other  of us have to humour them
i dont think the guardian should be blamed for trying to provide marginalized people with a certain level of respect however awkward their methods might be
a lot of these comments just show how intolerant our society is so many people who are not affected by this remarking on how they are not affected by this as if that makes it pointless it isnt for you allowing people to use mx just makes our society more inclusive surely that is a good thing especially when its something so minor to those of us not impacted
thanks but ill just stick with comrade
the whole thing doesnt need an artificial solution its fixing itself who really finds themself addressed nowadays as nonourific surname except teachersmost organisations send letters now that simply say dear hilary jones rather than worry about whether the recipient is male or female single or married just like themself which is a reflexive pronoun that caters for the use of the usually plural they to describe an unknown person in the singular in a genderneutral way while using a singular ending to form a new word
youre as boring and ordinary as the rest of us just accept it
dont be silly whos forcing anyone to use a gender neutral title why does a title that reflects peoples identity degrade society are these titles such a cornerstone of our society i dont remember the ms riots
if people dont insert gender into every single thing how can we even consider ourselves civilized much less progressive next thing you know youll say you dont care oh the oppression
whatever
they are simple biological differentiations but the guardian doesnt like that
that would be confusing mex maybe
i am neither mr mrs or ms but mx hes a typo
im not a part of the community but im in the group thats likely to interact with and read articles from within the community whether on gender sexuality or general selfdiscovery and ive never ever seen this term before also it has an x in it and no pronunciation guide and all of the possibilities that roll off my lips sound quite contrived im giving this one a miss personally im off the opinion that if ms and mr cant escape hierarchy and be neutral terms and new mx is just going to be interpretted socially as a subset of ms for the genderpicky
you need specific qualifications for them afaiu anyone can use the title dr its only if you try and practice medicine or try and use it for other fraudulent activity that creates a problem same with a lot of titles eg reverand
as far as i am aware modern turkish is way ahead of most european languages on this score the formal written address for both males and females and also of course noncisgendered individuals of which there are quite a visibly high number in the larger cities is sayın whereas the verbal equivalent is efendim admittedly you can sex it up a bit as bey efendi or hanım efendi when addressing either a man or a woman respectively but the simple form is deemed more elegant and there is no gender variety of third person pronoun but simply o which works for people and things regardless of gender sex animation or the lack of it
so this has nothing to do with those who are happy with their birth assigned gender its will not affect their lives in the slightest not every thing that happens is to accommodate the majority sometimes things happen that improve the lot of those who actually need their lot improved the most plus there are a few issues with that number you obviously pulled it out of your ass the most cited number of transgender people in the us is a conservative  which equates to about  of the population surely all those people deserve to be catered for not to even mention those number are undoubtedly underestimated due to the nature of the topic if we encourage and support these sorts concessions then that number will certainly increase proportionally in level with the real number of people who are transgender
but whether youre right or wrong its certainly the case that financial interests love it when the guardian devotes so much of its space to such issues that are of enormous interest to a tiny minority and at most of no interest but sometimes also intensely irritating to almost everyone else and all the while theyre laughing all the way to the bank grabbing those assets and making democracy obsolete
ignoring the fact that you pulled the stat out of your arse and that you clearly dont understand what recurring means at the very least this change makes no difference to that  of people and provides a solution to those who find it an issue what reason then is there not to do it i would argue having a more understanding and tolerant world benefits us all
you could put that in the mixif you leave out the i
why not go the whole hog why do we even need words
the headline is an oxymoron political correctness deems speech and actions to be conducted a certain way to do otherwise incurs the stigma of not being politically correct and therefore ipso facto to be disregarded and scorned that attitude itself shows a closedmind perspective to open discussion aka free speech
you are very wronga group of unelected unselected people are being put in a position to decide which language the rest of us can use what we are allowed to say what we are allowed to do what we are allowed to thinkthen once they have written these rules they hound everyone that does not stick to them even though everyone had no say in the rules and may not even know what they arethey say they do this to make the world a nicer place and remove hate but if anyone breaks their rules or challenges them they are subjected to campaigns of hate being banned from events being abused on the internet being hassled in the street and so on
its only patronising if they mean it to be patronisng the old lady that works in my local greggs bakery calls me love i dont think her or the majority of the men you deal with mean it to be patronsing thats just how you have taken it to mean
great anecdote very demonstrative of a real problem that if you give too much priority to your feelings it becomes impossible to get anything done or to live in the world or in this case to have a car to drive you cant live in the world if you cant deal with the fact that the world isnt perfect men understand this every day i see evidence that middle class women really struggle with it
you are alan partridge and i claim my 
gtgtgtbut it made me think of the countless times ive been called a girl or one of the girls by an older man and it usually is an older man and the point in my life at which it started to bother me because were tired of getting hurt when we use lady or woman or maam because the particular female it was last used on hated feeling old what would you like us to do were in a no win situation
dont worry about how you are adressed by me rebecca
ladies perhaps it can sound condescending or overformal and it isnt ageindependent its the counterpart to gentlemen not to guys
i dont think what you describe is a problem its friends being informal and something many people of all ages do men become boys as in boys night out too whats a problem for example is men in the workplace calling their male colleagues men and their female colleagues girls where it is just patronising it would be like french or german men using the polite vous or sie for male colleagues and the informal tu and du for the women if you have any understanding of foreign languages i have heard people of all ages complaining about this so its not just about somethings
im from the north and have never heard anyone refer to a woman as my tart and if any man called me that id be mightily offended
how awful for you
how about middleagedmanfriend
i didnt say i was bothered by any of them apart from good girl it depends on how its said the nuance i guess i actually find the word mate quite sweet
sweetness sweetness i was only joking when i said
what you frequently have customers saying hey girl can you do this for me thats just plain rude where on earth do you work
nuance lol
works for the aussies
guys get refered to as the boys all the time its no biggy
perhaps paul hollywood considers mel sue and mary friends perhaps he said it with affection
i saw the programme the teacher who was doing that was doing it without thinking about the ramifications realised it wasnt a good idea as soon as it was pointed out to him and stopped he had no problem with it being pointed out or stopping doing it so no need to cut him any slack at all
here we are in the world of pcrebecca needs to grow up
it bothers me because its patronising to be called a good girl i am  would you like to be called a good boy just for doing your job
clever
geezertoy
you are responsible for your feelings not the him
my brothers are  we still call them the boys
could you not use the word fartnot in yorkshirethe words arewhos sht
a ive never uttered any of them because b i dont know what they mean im old
i call everybody darling both male and female but i am an old queen who is shit with names
just dont call me shirley
alright darlin i wont
i did read it its the classic this is so worrying but im not so worried myself 
why does it irk you what logical reason is there to be bothered by that
i for one welcome our new puritanical feminist overlords comrad
call him hun back yes sweetheart often works too
no it doesnt im a woman and it makes me feel annoyed and patronised how would you end up feeling if groups of men were referred to in a friendly and familiar manner and women werent what if they just excluded people like yourself you could wear a badge to let people know that youre not looking for informality
girly night inanyonegirls night outanyonegirly underwear partyall terms of endearment by wait for itgirls
ahmen over  whats to be done with them perhaps brave new world and logans run were on to something
oi oi savaloy
how about oi
depends are you going to a strip club
my husband is in his mids he regularly tells me hes off for a long bike ride with the boys or that the boys are arranging a walking weekend not one is under  and they all refer to the group as such
attention class again the answer seems to be in the question surely
im sure other comments have already addressed this but it sounded to me like a phrase that he had probably been using for a long time as a term of endearment i imagine everyone involved in bake off over the years referred to mel and sue as the girls its a generic term used by millions of people in certain circumstances the article addressed this issue by stating that context is everything
sounds pretty nauseating not sure whats wrong with mate though unless its being said by people youd like to think of as anything other than mates i suppose
yesterday i went into a garage to talk about replacing some brake shoes on the wall the chap man guy sweetheart prince had a picture of a voluptuous woman in a state of undress i felt leered at despite being in my s otherwise he was very professional i need my car fixingdilemma
he also said it at least once to a man in the house of commons
nice one rebecca but it seems most of the comments thus far have not read the full article particularly the last paragraph
you dont have to like everything other people say
why does it bother you what logical reason is there to be bothered by it
oh sorry i missed out think they
ah the joys of being called duck when in derby dont feel affronted
leaving aside the paul hollywood issue he is a complete cock theyre just terms used in casual conversation with people whose name you dont know i tend to not use diminutives and such but a lot of people think its friendly speaking as a bloke i have never been offended by someone i barely know calling me mate chap flower love duck pal or any other semantically null term of vague affection
so numbers then but who gets the odd or the even and how long before they gain undesirable connotations im number six
the only thing im currently finding cringier than this article are the antipc brigade commenters theres something almost robotic about them
i have half iraqi step children two of whom have black partners what we call their children mixed race etc is always changing and it is is impossible to know who decides what the new appropriate term is and how one term is better than another whatever we say will be changed by some one or other next year of course to us they are just lovely kids and the right term does not matter but it is interesting to hear them talk aged five about whether they are more or less brown than their friends
rd world problems sunshine everyday
that the author is making a big deal of something pretty unimportant and harmless in most cases these kind of words are terms of affection but obviously can be used in a negative way you need context
or companion
how about comrade
you would prefer  expensive
but it made me think of the countless times ive been called a girl or one of the girls by an older man and it usually is an older man and the point in my life at which it started to bother me for a long time i didnt mind at all but around the age of  it started to become a mild irritant sure and if people started treating you in a more formal manner while others were treated in a friendly manner you would complain about that instead you may see what they are doing as belittling or whatever but thats really not what its about you would be sucking the life for normal discourse if we had to remove all things that some people might be offended by basically lighten up francis
youd have to ask the boyslads im not offended or angry unlike many of the people who seem to be unreasonably furious about the fact that some mature women do not wish to be known as girls
thats football not real newsif grown men spend their time playing ball games what do the little loves expect
could you not use the word fart or are you too ladylike up here in yorkshire everyone gets love male or female young or old drop down a bit further south and its duck or me duck ive also been called sweetheat my love darlin and a host of other soubriquets and it doesnt bother this old dear one jot nor tittle anything has to be better than you guys as favoured by the younger generation now that i hate
i imagine that the author would especially dislike being called honeybunch which is surprisingly common
knowthanks autocorrect
women ten years or older than me call me hun all the time they no they dont have a prayer but like to flirt i enjoy it
if you need a list it is only to stop you from blurting out thought crimes so youll let the fester unseen people like you should be locked up for life
sometimes its just cultural and in the north love is given to everyone its part of the background noise
i am sure he does not use this with his make colleagues you might be surprised its not uncommon for blokes in the black country to call on another flower and in yorkshire love is as frequently applied to men by men as it is to women and if you dont like it have you thought about telling him
you should have slapped him for the pet
works for me 
zzzzzzz
i work in a bank i get called darling princess love mate the god awful my dear but the thing that makes me wince the most is good girl always always by men over  
predudice power ism wot it isnt
cabbage or does that just apply to  of us
nay lad i think not just an all purpose greeting
bake off never understood the appeal of this show procelebrity shed building now id watch that
thats the beautiful thing about language no book of class can prepare you for being plunged into the ways it used in a real human interaction you just have to dive in to the deep end and pick things up as you go along the more memorably hilarious mistakes made the better
thats not rhyming slang though example septic tank yankexample apples amp pears stairs that said treacle tart mary berry according to the first returned link in my google search so maybe you are correct in a way
i use girls as in my experience women enjoy the words association with youth beauty and wit the word i detest is ladies which at best sounds like a lavatory and at worst smacks of privilege social class and titles
next week the hairshirt why every progressive who wants to be woke must have one
my boss has called me a good lad on more than one occasion when ive done something he likes although he didnt ruffle my hair and throw a stick to fetch in contrast being called a young man presumably more acceptable to the author as it has no age connotation means you screwed up perhaps i should complain to hr and demand that action be taken or i could just put it down to him growing up in a rough part of the east midlands like a normal person
thanks for that pavanne you answered it better and more concisely than i would
have you been drinking
oi
or you could try reading the article not just the headline crazy idea i know
should have read male autocorrect
the political correctness police are out in full force these days
bad taste i would bite you back
a male colleague at work calls me hun and it really irks me i am sure he does not use this with his make colleagues
what are most of the comments saying then
its political correctness gone mad seriously though this is all getting a bit boring now nobody has the absolute right to not be offended the girls need to grow some balls
as usual with these offence articles context is everything yes girl or dear or darlin might sound and be intended to be a patronising putdown in a work environment but so would son sunshine my lad or indeed boyin other contexts perfectly okwe all know this so the article is a bit onesided
in my world women refer to other women as girls far more than men do which is obviously not acceptable one of my female colleagues in conversation often refers to men as boys and frequently asks me about my sex life which is embarrassing and intrusive i also often get called love by women who think they are being friendly but it is actually matronising and possessive and i find it rather demeaning obviously male sexism is far worse than female sexism but it would help reduce sexism against women if women stopped being sexist against men
on sensitivity some years ago i heard someone saying that a favourite of her mothers was a person who takes offense when it is not intended is a fool a person who takes offense when it is intended is a bigger fool dont mean to shout just emphasis not a bad principle if subject to limitswhen i lived in bristol in the s a common form of address from shop assistants and others was my lover i dont recall it leading to a breakdown in social order
as a student i worked in a home for the elderly during the summer my pet name used by the generally older female staff was wee bumsy did i take offence no did i feel threatened no
feminists speak for everyone what does that mean
im in my s it is extremely normal for people to refer to me and other guys in any given social group as boys it never even occurred to me to get offended
over  the approved term is fuckbuddy
they had a good time with them they went for dinners and they gave them a flower then they had sex with them and many years later had three children however you have missed the point if you know the gender of someone you should use he or she
yes ive been using they since i learnt about plain english maybe this article will help spread the word or at least thinking about it
ive used they for ages 
it is currently in limited usage by a small minority group primarily by non binary people without mass usage it mass relevance i doubt it will catch on as the default term particularly but when it makes the language less clear rather than more clear and also sounds incorrect and in some cases quite rude colloquially to a large number
in other news a triangle is now a tetrahedron because somebody wanted it to be
why why why youd have to delve into the history of grammatical gender and pie language if youre seeking an answer to that one whilst the intention may be loable the current tendency among spanish political and public figures to equateconfuse grammatical gender with natural gender is both ignorant and irritating los y las españoles etc this is not the solution to gender inequality as it does not support application across the board los y las víctimas anyone it is most curious that in a country such as spain so given to the blind defence of corporativism lawyers chemists driving instructors you name it every professional collective is the guardian of its own indisputable virtue and the stature of spanish as the richest of all languages philologists cant find employment for love nor money and yet any industrial agronomist masquerading as a politician feels at liberty to establish new linguistic usage for the masses tocino and velocidad spring to mind
i tried reading the article in the mirror recently on maria munir in which they were referred to as they see the problem already and i honestly didnt know if i was coming or going
i think ms is becoming more generally accepted than you think i use it now without even thinking about it when filling in stuff
in revising charity constitutions i have used the term they rather than he or the cumbersome formulations heshe or she the first time in the s to be both grammatically accurate and for ease of reading and understanding makes total sense
what about them and us
why not just reclaim him and his to mean him or her and his or hers whos book is itits hisis that the royal hisive no idea mate ask him
while the push to use they as a genderless pronoun is new for english it has been in use like that for as long as english has existed as a recorded language for some strange reason for centuries now people keep thinking its a new thing the author also fails to mention an excellent example of sexneutral they from shakespeare romeo and juliet act  scene  someone knocks at the door someone unseen therefore its unknown whether theyre male or female friar lawrence says hark how they knock addressing rampj whos there addressing the door it is rather old hat in other languages of course because not all languages have grammatical gender and dont necessarily conflate gender and biological sex if it wasnt for the fact the indoeuropean had just three noun classes that got to be labelled masculine feminine and neuter the whole confusion would not have arisen for instance if common grammatical terminology had been based on bantu languages with their myriad of noun classes instead of indoeuropean ones with just three this article would not exist while english was picking and choosing its vocabulary from latin and german what an extraordinarily odd view of the development of the english language or any language for that matter the vocuabulary of english isnt pieced together from loanwords from latin and german english sits on a different branch of the westgermanic language family from german and doesnt derive anything from it at all except for the odd quite recent loanword for that to even be possible german would have had to have existed before english did quod non it has a lot in common with german because theyre both descendants from protogermanic perhaps there is another common anglophoneonly misunderstanding at play here because in english the words for germanic and german are very similar some people with not much grasp of comparative linguistics seem to be confused about what they mean the confusion does not exist in german where the words are germanisch and deutsch respectively or in french where they are germanique and allemand
im not going to bother
yes that usage is jarring i dont find it so when the person is unknown though
the only trouble with this is that one ends up sounding like prince charles
youll have a heart attack if you check the gender for the french words for penis and vagina
it has been accepted in british english for at least  in formal contexts too
eh
i wrote a sf book that largely featured aliens of various kinds where heshe would have been just plain wrong but they is not a perfect solution either since its never clear whether its plural or singular eg my friend was in the other group but they didnt like it in theory this shouldnt be a problem since my friend is the subject of the first clause but they is so strongly associated with the plural that its easy to be led astray we really do need a decent singular genderneutral pronoun
i know i wasnt aware that this was some newfangled thing ive been doing it my whole life
that is a different context though they suggests an unknown third party whereas he or she suggests familiarity you wouldnt say i saw daniel earlier they said they were doing fine it just doesnt flow
i should perhaps make it clear than when i used the word sex i didnt mean that i envisaged the table and the book enjoying a physical relationship
in language gender is not the same as sex
me too i will actually stop reading textbooks or articles that do this because it annoys me so much and is so damn confusing
its not wrong if it is in current english usage usage is everything would you say if i were you is clearly wrong yet it breaks the rules
ms is not a solution and is still assumed to be the property of unmarried feminists this is changing whatever solution you propose it will take generations for any associations to adjust
only if the authors argument were that nonuse of an ungendered pronoun is the only cause of sexism which is not the argument she is making the number of people who cant read for comprehension today amazes me
my friend called her foetus sex unknown they but to me it just sounded as though she was having twins she said my childs not an it i called my foetus it sex unknown quite happily though i felt rightly that he was a boy i do find they were about one individual awkward and clunky but maybe that can change given that you were can work for one having originally been a plural
dear saddam
sorry to have lectured you earlier on what you already know
they are not amused why dont we just go the whole hog and cut off our bits and bobs and all be the same identical nothing to make us individual in any way shape or form oh might as well shave our heads as well its they gone mad
my least favourite type of comment on here i mean he so clearly isnt joking oooh im soooo incredulous what youre saying is sooooo ridiculous it must surely be a joke can you tell im feeling a little stressed
wife originally had nothing to do with marriage it was a general term for a woman it still is in geordie dialect my can refer to possession but also to personal relationship i dont possess my workplace
yes i started using they as a genderneutral pronoun back in high school which was the s partly my decision came from realising we used they this way in casual conversation all the time just not in writing i just wish offence hadnt been brought up social progress in matters large or small doesnt always stem from offence or fear of offending sometimes it just happens when several people realize something or other is silly using a gendered pronoun when one intends to be gender neutral is silly
and thats why you wouldnt use it in that context noone is saying you should
there is definitely an argument for a singular pronoun thats nongender specific but they is just a complete mess of a word to use for it for example they went to the leicester city ground with them to see them win the league they won ahead of tottenham which they were very pleased about vs she went to the leicester city ground with her to see them win the league they won ahead of tottenham which she was very pleased about
you is a plural pronoun and we seem to manage with it just fine
me too i really dont think there is any controversy there the author must know some extraordinarily bloodyminded people if she has so much trouble using it
yes although what sting did is actually what youre describing he used it as a rd person singular maybe the bit you think sounds odd would be using they when you know the sex of the individual as in they sting used it as a rd person singular
i have been using they and their in this way for years and it seems perfectly natural and sensible to me
youused to be nd person plural and with thouthee as nd person singular exactly as still exists in france with tuvous and like in french the plural form was used to people of superior social status we did away with that over the centuries it is possible that in time heshe will be replaced by they too it is already in current usage as a nongendered singular
ask them
i have been using they them their and themself as singular for as long as i can remember as his or her and other such constructs are cumbersome the use of the masculine to indicate someone whose gender is unknown or unimportant is just as jarring as the increasing use of she which has been increasingly prevalent among guardinistas and feminists for some years
the great thing is that you can mixandmatch thus getting a jab in at a approved target group while simultaneously demonstrating impeccable pc credentials the comments mark the latest example of a male tech ceo making aggressive insensitive and tonedeaf remarks about people less fortunate than them
along with many others have been using they or their in this regard for decades aside from the sexism issue its better more accurate use of the language
and sick only means unhealthy if you dont like how the english language evolves i suggest you move to france where they have an official academy and laws to police the use of their language
indeed but this isnt german is it
surely it already fills that purpose wed just have to get rid of the negative or rather dehumanising connotations
many languages use masculine and feminine forms for all sorts of things eg in romanian bread is feminine yet the author picks on english
i for one would happily drop heshehimherhishers in all circumstances just like most dialects of english dropped thoutheethythine centuries ago
removing inherent biases from language wont fix everything but it is at least something we can all be aware of in our daytoday lives interesting article im glad they wrote it
they wants my precious they does it sounds like something gollum might say
i wont 
this may just be a major step forward in communication for mankind
this sounds like fixing the symptom not the cause noones claiming its a fix its just a small step in the right direction this approach is also culturally insensitive as it only considers the form of one single language noones claiming it should be used for all languages it just happens to work for english
are you arguing that vocabulary andor language does not influence ones thoughts and perceptions
is this an article from thee grauniade of  if not i think the author may not know what theyre on about
doesnt change
its
they had a good time with they they went for dinner and they gave they a flower then they had sex with they and many years later had three theys and theys
part of my job before i retired was responsibility for written procedures in a global company i mandated the use of the third person plural in all documents it worked absolutely fine btw we also had a rule that you could write in american or british english but it had to be one or the other
the problem isnt solved because it when used on a person is seen as disrespectful or implying that they lack humanity
ive been using they instead of he or she since for ever and them too
i think shes wrong on this
nor what you think it means
they are given a gender which is different to sex both as a concept in sociobiology and linguistics but please dont let facts get in the way of a good sneer
gillian was getting ready for the journey hermione picked up her toothbrush whose toothbrush did hermione pick up
not a pronoun used for humans though so what disturbs you more to be multiplied or dehumanised
but less impersonal than it
of more importance when are the words miss and mrs going to be eradicated from the human language frankly its noones business whether im married or not and a mans title dont change according to his or should i say their in light of this article marital status ms is not a solution and is still assumed to be the property of unmarried feminists
except that using it to talk about a person sounds creepy distant and kind of alien so no problem not solved they is much better and is already in common usage
are harry and hermione married whats yours is mine whats mine is mine too
why dont you like to write he or she and what do you do instead
i think they is the way to proceed as a default until english is spoken in a world where the inherent power disparity between the hes and shes is eradicated i think its the way to proceed full stop even if the power disparity is eradicated it will still jar in many contexts
you are not alone
that clearly should be she but if it were a person then they would be fine
me too why this needed people ever to tie themselves into knots i dont know
i am rather amazed that this is controversial it has been common practice to use they in place of rd person singular when the gender is not knownrelevant for years i have used it throughout my education i have taught its use i have corrected heshe to they as a copy editor and i have used it in translations too and at no time ever has anyone raised the smallest objection or expressed the smallest degree of surprise
well a woman can equally say my partnerhusband implying if you will her property we as a couple always refer to each other as my partner when talking to a third party hopefully avoiding the implied possesion meaning
is it
chickens
in french inanimate objects are given a sex la table le livre etc how shocking is that its like saying a woman is equivalent to a table whereas a man is equivalent to a book and obviously knows more because of iti am being sarcastic this is the most ridiculous article i have ever seen even in the guardian
sting did it ages ago if you love somebody set them free the next step using them for a rd person singular is just logical even if it sounds odd
whoops wrong this issue has popularity and general consensus they as a singular gender neutral pronoun has been around for centuries as the article suggests and is widely used today as speaking english on a daily basis will prove
er yeah so much less clumsy to use a pronoun that noones heard of and will roll their eyes over than one thats been in use for decades and makes perfect sense whats clumsy is the barbarous heshe and shes that proliferate
why not nonbinary person
but as my wife refers to me as her husband also implying possession i fail to see what the issue of possession is we are husband and wife in our marriage
they as a genderless pronoun can be implied as in someone left their window wide open however i notice the author fails to mention languages such as spanish french german in fact the majority of indoeuropean languages where gender is part and parcel of the structure of the idiom
what grammatical problem is that
my parents my friend my god i dont think you can necessarily infer ownership from my
there is already a genderless singular pronoun it problem solved
well it is the genderless pronoun in english language but that would probably not help the case
this is what i thought
if your wife is your sports or business partner there is no problem in using partner however the word you seem to be looking for is spouse
me too loved the whole book and the equality
me too
you confuse grammatical gender with sex a person for example is une personne regardless of sex further sa nationalité est françaisehisher nationality is french
well done on finding a half dozen or so examples out of several hundred years of literature truly a daming piece of evidence in this important argument
no almost be definition it doesnt in french and i think in italian as well possessive adjectives such as the equivalents of hisher agree with the noun they qualify and the noun has a gender so in the translation into french of he picked up his toothbrush the word his is translated by sa since a toothbrush brosse a dents is feminine in other words french avoids the problem discussed in this article at the expense of what to me is unnecessary complexity
there are certain occupations where what you say can affect your ability to do the job if for example a crown court judge declared that he thought islamic terrorism was absolutely fine or if a schoolteacher declared that paedophilia was a valid lifestyle etc if you hold a position in politics then when you express a view on a political matter you are doing so as a representative of your party if your views expressed are clearly at odds with your party then you still have some latitude to express your views but only so long as you strongly qualify them eg by saying something like on this point i personally disagree with my partyetc that has nothing to do with a citizens right to free expression which is far wider and should be permitted unless and until it contravenes laws such as defamation or public order legislation people may not be forced by legal sanction into using the politically correct formulae but they are often bullied and even threatened with sanctions at work lastly godfrey blooms only crime when he referred to women as sluts was that he failed to know that the noun slut now has a different semantic meaning than the one it had when he was a child and when i was a child a slut used to mean a woman who is untidy it was roughly the female equivalent of slob
since you are evidently not capable of saying anything yourself i guess thats the best you can hope for
if thats the sort of thing youre against and thats as far as it goes then you are merely opposed to the abuse of pc rather than pc itself exceedingly few people of whatever persuasion would respond that way to an innocent use of nitty gritty now racial slurs blatant homophobia or holocaust denial thats quite another matter and in my view their restriction represents the importance and value of pc though only the opponents of such consideration ever tend to use that term
my issue with political correctness is the hegemonic influence that certain word structures can not be said because they conflict with what is perceived to be the correct ideological view it might sound like semantics but i think theres a difference between what cannot be said and what one thinks should not be said i understand that it sounds more serious and sinister when we refer to this as ideology but the basic principle is that some words upset other people and that as a result its good to avoid using them and lots of people will have a different view as to what should and should not be said and everyone will adjust their language or not accordingly its no more or less benign as people objecting to swearing youre not prohibited from doing so but people will react to whether you do based on what their own views on it are
my issue with political correctness is the hegemonic influence that certain word structures can not be said because they conflict with what is perceived to be the correct ideological view
let me just add to that following catoxxs comment for the record yes many words are unacceptable in our society and many terms have changed over time along with attitudesand rightly so ideally we all do our best but sometimes people are confronted with experiences that challenge them and its often in those times people can say some dumb and offensive stuff but it can also be subjective and if you try to stop people from having an opinion rightlyor wrongly then nothing will be discussed and people will just feel more resentment to the social norms that allegedly bind usas gary seems to
if he thinks its just about taboo words then hes an idiot who doesnt even understand why hes apologising its like okay when nigel farage made a sweeping negative generalisation about romanian people on lbc some people leapt his defence saying variations on its not racism romanian isnt a race it seems to me that their understanding went racism is bad because its a taboo doing the exact same thing that a racist does but about a nationality rather than a race is therefore not racism therefore not in contradiction of the taboo on racism therefore perfectly fine im now wondering do you understand why racism is not merely taboo
isnt objecting to that just ammunition for those of us who might say that the antipc brigade say they want debate when they really want the opposite a platform to speak from and silence from anyone who doesnt agree i agree with your post but this in particular its striking that a lot of opposition to notional pc points seem to want a system in which not only do they have freedom of speech which i have no problem with but the freedom not to have to hear any response which as you say is not a position that supports free speech
quite right when you look at the examples the antipc people are using they can all be broadly categorised as  people responding to free speech with equal freedom  people choosing to modify their speech because they care whether they offend people  private businesses setting policy maybe a fraction of a percent will actually involve someone in public authority expecting people to modify their speech under threat of punishment and funnily enough that stuff is just as unpopular with the pc brigade what these free speech people seem to expect ie people who are offended by racism not speaking out for fear of upsetting the racist people not being free to say chairwoman because tradition demands that they say chairman and businesses being required to conform to the standards of someone who isnt even employed by them is far more oppressive than political correctness
i think youre certainly on to something there as you say the common perception of some sort of state sponsored speech police is almost entirely illusory i think the origins of the movement and of the term might shed light on this it was a leftover of cold war era communism where it was used derogatively by dissidents but taken taken up by left wing groups in the late s early s a period when a lot of frankly absurd radical thought was taken rather too seriously i think the term has never quite shaken off its origins within these earnest radical groups as for white guilt thats very interesting as i honestly cant detect it within myself and i ought to qualify i suppose perhaps there isnt one fixed reason for peoples distaste
great apology though i think the one on jimmy kimmel was tad more sincere i think his point is hypocrisy and context that most of us to some degree say things that could be deemed unpc and prejudice etc at one time or otherpeople moderate and censor themselves all the time depending on who theyre with and where they are its the context and relationship people have with each other that makes certain words acceptable or not but on paper all of the context is and can be removed i work in a very multicultural environment and its pretty much the furthest you can get from the pc brigade and it comes from all quarters privately or publicly but at the end of the day nobody cares that much at least depending on the context and parties involved and if soits discussed and people move on everyone has a point or may have some truth to what they say on some personal level or not gary oldman was speaking from his experience and empathizing with melslightly its the malicious context that makes comments unacceptable in most circumstances im not saying its ok to say whatever you want whenever you want and neithers gary but people say sht all the time and sometimes people need to just deal with and get over it rather then try and hypocritically enforce thought police policyif things become taboo doesnt mean they go away
your logic is self evident but you are entirely missing my point i dont deny that language influences thought but its a relatively small influence when compared to the way thought influences language at least in adults young children may be more fertile ground you have assumed a one way street ie languagegtthoughtgtactiongtreality in fact all four of these phenomena interact and your chosen pathway is one of the lesser in terms of significance this is not a mere technicality but in fact is a rather arrogant assumption about how to manipulate people and is at the heart of the problem people have with political correctness
none of those cases involve being silenced though im not saying i agree with the use of every example here but in effect theyre no different to the everyday interactions where someone oversteps the line with someone else and makes them feel bad about something nothing there prevents the individual from saying exactly the same thing to someone else in the future this they really just demonstrate what a nonsense all the furious free speech rhetoric is in three examples someone heard something they didnt like and responded just like normal people do all the time if theres any influence of pc its that someone who thought what was said was racist or sexist did not feel obliged to just suck it up the entire objection here is that these people were wrong to hold their opinion but so are all of the racists sexists and homophobes that free speech protects why should the rights of people who object to these things to say that they object at the time without any authoritarian or official backing not be respected just as much isnt objecting to that just ammunition for those of us who might say that the antipc brigade say they want debate when they really want the opposite a platform to speak from and silence from anyone who doesnt agree in the other example it isnt even a case of someone objecting people are not forced to say chairwoman or chairperson and a lot of people dont someone choosing a job title is not forced to comply with pc regulation  or whatever they are choosing in much the same way when i am referring to someone of a certain race i choose not to say coloured because i know that its likely to give offence and that isnt my intention i could say i dont care if i offend them my right to offend trumps their right not to be offended i have that right i dont exercise it because i do care about not offending people its not my intention to offend so i try to avoid doing so this is what i find most ridiculous the antipc brigade claim not to want to offend they claim that they cant help accidentally offending people they claim that its a minefield and so forth then pc comes along and provides them with an idiots guide to not offending people and they attack that i guess what im saying is you can only do that so much while still expecting anyone to believe that you are just speaking your mind and offending people by mistake or without thought you can pull a godfrey bloom you can claim to innocently believe that bongo bongo land and referring to women as sluts are not offensive as far as you are aware and that the modern world is ohso confusing but you cant expect people to believe you its sort of like saying im so lost how am i supposed to find my way while refusing to stop for directions or look at a map people are realising and being supported in saying that simply claiming to be a bit out of touch is not an acceptable excuse if you live in a world that has only ever told you that racism and sexism and such are unacceptable for your entire life and still pretend not to understand it creates the impression that youre lying but again this is not about anyone being silenced it is just a slightly more coordinated form of tutting
if you read what he said next via a pr firm the statement reads that the jews are the chosen peoplepure dripping passiveaggressive vitriol he obviously doesnt give a fuck anymore
yes i am you come over here and make racists jokes and see whether you get to keep your stupid teeth
well arent you clever
this whole discussion is idiotic there always have been and always will be certain expressions that are considered out of bounds of acceptable speech and people who utter them are held accountable through general forms of public opprobrium what changes over time is the nature of those expressions it used to be okay to call someone a cripple now its not people who complain about pc speech police just miss being able to do so and until someone is thrown in jail for expressing their opinion please dont make this a free speech argument
there you go using language that is designed to scare people who do not have the verbal skills that you do to shut them up by calling them reactionary the only ones reactionary are the pc brigade in their attempts to change people attitudes by fear i would tell you where to go but the censor brigade would sensor it and free speech would be lost that alone tells you how far down the line we have become when only one side can really say what they want while the other viewpoint has to watch their ps and qs in case they are censored and that is my point pc is an attack on freedom of speechfreedom of expression and freedom of thought
heaven forfend
he has free speech however if he occupies a position in ukip and says something which contravenes ukip policies or ethos then they are entitled to relieve him of his position being a politician means you represent your political party in what you say actually at the time ukip were very vocal in saying that they would not penalise anyone for expressing their personal views even if they conflicted with the party line they expressed this at a time when they had decided to retain winston mckenzie who is still an active party member btw after he compare samesex marriage to child abuse this is interesting because in olly nevilles case the view he expressed in support for samesex marriage in his capacity as a member of the party although there was nothing whatsoever to suggest that he believed it to be party policy however party members later stated that he was not removed for this but for a blog post he made which spoke purely hypothetically about the morality of other sexual practices ukip essentially said that he was not removed because of his views on samesex marriage which are in line with popular opinion within the party by the way which could have been interpreted as nonpersonal but as a result of views he expressed that inarguably were personal in short it seems that olly neville was removed for his nonhomophobic views because even though they were clearly personal they might have misrepresented the party whereas david silvester and winston mckenzie were not removed from the party for their veryhomophobic views because according to farage they obviously didnt represent the party i think that evidence speaks for itself it seems clear to me that ukip are not supportive of all free speech and the question of whether the views that they have tolerated and not tolerated represent the party seems to be answered with you can express those views as long as they are as or more homophobic than our own ukip do not support free speech they simply support bigots
im not really sure what youre getting at here im not defending swearing or the idea that its ok to swear at a professionals i dont think anyone no matter what there job should have to put up with abusive language but the idea that calling someone a wanker or an arsehole is in anyway comparable to using words like nigger or faggot words which are steeped in years of hatred and institutionalized violence and discrimination are in anyway comparable the fact that you think they are or that the appropriate response to hate speech is either give it back or develop a tolerance for it speaks volumes about you
none of those cases involve being silenced though im not saying i agree with the use of every example here but in effect theyre no different to the everyday interactions where someone oversteps the line with someone else and makes them feel bad about something nothing there prevents the individual from saying exactly the same thing to someone else in the future
a few years ago i witnessed a colleague being rebuked when he referred to a group of asylum seekers as these people the person rebuking him was a politically correct idiot i also hears a woman on a tube train snap at a man who said to her theres a seat over there darling the nonsense about saying chairman instead of calling someone a chair or trying to ban words like manageress or actress or as i once heard an elderly lady in a police station saying that the occupant of the house opposite her was a coloured gentleman was told off by a desk clerk these are examples of political correctness that i have seen and i find them deeply sinister
oh his apology to the adl that accused him of being antisemetic is also a bit sarcastic i hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt genuine and that i have an enormous personal affinity for the jewish people in general and those specifically in my life the jewish people persecuted thorough the ages are the first to hear gods voice and surely are the chosen people i would like to sign off with shalom aleichembut under the circumstances perhaps today i lose the right to use that phrase so i will wish you all peacegary oldman
i doubt norgate would have the courage of his convictions and actually use the word negro in front of black people
it came from the spanishportuguese for black spanish and portuguese is a latin based language latin is derived from classical greek
actually as you have just illustrated pc appears to mean unpc people making up rules that they will break and making up authorities who will oppress them for breaking those rules i hope your comment doesnt get censored as right now it is exposing precisely how wrong you are to selfcensor really what i find most bizarre is this notion that pcs rules are unknowable that you might break one entirely in innocence rather than say in a bid to test peoples tolerance and that you could not possibly predict what would enrage the pc brigade in reality you know exactly what those rules are and you also know that the worst that will happen to you if you break them is that for example your comment on someone elses website which has well established terms and conditions that lays out its rules btw might be deleted
hes pretty much had his career dude hence the unguarded popoff he arguably peaked around the state of grace or track  era quarter of a century ago nowobviously the recent le carre remake was a boring quickfire travesty
but thats nothing to do with cultural marxism well meaning liberals are usually the ones who see racism and sexism as a one way street of course there are also some feminists and far left people who fall into this trap as well they dont realise it is racist to condone lower standards of behaviour from someone who isnt white
i dont need to give examples as the so called unpc brigade will know what i am talking about even although you say you dont right but thats how reactionary movements tend to work isnt it by saying cmon i think we all know what were talking about here wink wink and letting people fill in the blanks with whatever personal prejudices they have as soon as they nail down the precise nature of what they are opposing people can dispute it the reason we ask you to give actual examples rather than vague assertions is because were not prepared to engage with a group whose position will change to ensure that it can never be rebutted that is just sound debating practice your telling us what the article is really about as much as confirms this you wont engage with the actual content of the article and you have already based your comments about it on an example that we have shown is completely divorced from that content really you are demonstrating well enough here that the socalled pc brigade isnt trying to censor or silence you we are in fact asking you questions asking you to divulge more about your views and you are responding by going all coy or dismissing us it seems that far from being silenced the unpc silence themselves and then have to find a scapegoat to explain why they pussed out of the debate that they constantly claim to want to have
he has free speech however if he occupies a position in ukip and says something which contravenes ukip policies or ethos then they are entitled to relieve him of his position so what do you consider examples of being silenced due to pc absent of criminalisation most restrictions are just similar to this example rather than anything more extensive
speaking as a white man who is not middle aged but certainly has a bit of a paunch going on i am always amazed when i hear the antipc brigade demanding this version of reality where pc means antiwhite and and antimale and so forth i have experienced none of this as a gay man i have experienced discrimination for my sexual orientation by institutions and by members of the public i have never been discriminated against for my whiteness i have never been discriminated against for my maleness i am inclined to say that white men who think that pc is attacking them have simply so completely bound up racism with whiteness and sexism with maleness that they simply cannot comprehend how one can be attacked without attacking the other this is where all that check your privilege stuff comes in its treated like an insult but its actually giving you the benefit of a doubt saying maybe you dont realise that this is racist because you have never experienced racism but trust us it is or maybe you dont realise that this is sexist because you have never experienced sexism but trust us it is of course white men always deny it and that leaves us trying to figure out why the hell white men are so keen to defend their right to be racist and sexist if they dont intend to use that right and claim not to support those who do really i find all this nonsense about the pendulum swinging too far the other way to be pathetic it makes me wonder how the hell white men clung to power for so long
he has free speech however if he occupies a position in ukip and says something which contravenes ukip policies or ethos then they are entitled to relieve him of his position being a politician means you represent your political party in what you say as a private citizen who does not represent ukip he can say whatever he likes and ukip will defend his right to do that
the article is really about pc and opposition to it and the reporter regards the unpc as right wing i regard myself as left wing and i object to her pc attitude in putting down those who disagree with her i dont need to give examples as the so called unpc brigade will know what i am talking about even although you say you dont i couldnt give a monkey about your viewpoint or argument as i am putting my views over to those who matter to me and that is the unpc brigade the pc brigade can play happy societies in the middle of an edl march as far as im concerned
better than making tenthrate comments on secondrate articles id posit
ukip is a libertarian party and supports free speech really tell that to olly neville
right just going to say first and foremost political correctness is not antifree speech any and all references to the right to free speech in your post are completely irrelevant political correctness in effect amounts to people who oppose racism and sexism and homophobia being encouraged to confront it rather than let it slide they could do that before and the racists and sexists and homophobes are just as free to ignore them now as they were then so just to be clear every single comment in this thread that claims that pc is an attack on free speech is wrong now onto your other point changing language does not create respect it creates an awful veneer of respect it means people speak their mind in their own homes with the curtains pulled only to those they trust and parrot the correct behaviour outside in full knowledge that if they make a mistake it could cost them a promotion or even their job it creates resentment it makes people prisoners of a sort speaking as someone who as a result of this veneer now feels a lot freer to do in public what everyday homophobes still to this day feel fully able to tell me i should do behind closed doors in case it annoys someone not them usually their kids because they are nothing if not utterly cowardly these pioneers of free speech i am actually fine with that the fact is these attitudes are wrong and we know they are people say you are entitled to your opinion and you are you are entitled to your opinion even if it is completely wrong even if it is founded on completely provably false facts which you then cobbled together an irrational conclusion from no one is saying that these stupid racist idiots are not entitled to their stupid racist opinions what we are saying is if these people are going to express these stupid racist bigoted hateful opinions lets make sure that people who dont agree with them get a voice see racists get by by being brash and loud and aggressive and they mostly arent challenged because people think that it will be too much hassle and that people who agree wont stand alongside them for fear of reprisal pc has succeeded in empowering people who hate racism to tell the racist guy to shut up thats all really the racist guy can carry on shouting his racism if he wants but people at least know that hes the one in the minority and eventually he learns to keep his stupid opinions to himself he probably doesnt learn that theyre wrong but he at least learns that no one agrees with them you talk about this veneer as if you think that pc is about making racists less racist it isnt what it is about is making it clear that racists are the exception rather than the norm its about future generations people my sisters kids age wont grow up in a world where racism is considered acceptable it will always be known to them as an irrational evil and thats entirely positive so you see now yes no one is being sent to prison and certainly no ones right to free speech is being infringed its just people who disagree with racists being empowered to say so when it might in the past have been easier to let it slide and its about making sure that if people are racist they cannot claim that its because they thought it was acceptable
i dont believe it is bogus my company a branch of a us parent company has started wishing its staff staff a happy holiday on or around december th there does seem to be a concerted effort to remove christmas from the vocabulary
hes been in hollywood for a long long time and made many films there he knows what hes talking about
absolutely ukip is a libertarian party and supports free speech the left are authoritarians and want to silence those they see as politically incorrect
said the ukip supporter
i mean putting aside that stories about changing the name of christmas are the fricking urexample of pc gone mad rhetoric that almost always turns out to be bogus i dont actually see whats wrong with referring to a period when several religious holidays all of which can be named individually without the pc brigade taking issue at all with a collective nonsecular term can you actually explain whats wrong with it or are you just going to splutter about it
changing christmas to holiday strikes me as particularly crass why
political correctness is linguistic fascism it should be stamped on wherever it rears its ugly head
what the hell does im actually quite projewish mean are you also quite problack or are you quite antiblack how prowhites are you you seem to think that suggesting a racial group share a common moral flaw is a reasonable subject for discussion and should not be labelled racist well if accusing an enitire race of a crime is not racist what would you say is that is by the very dictionary definition racist if you think you should be free to indiuge in racist slander or facts for you then have the balls to say so
seriously this n wordp word bollocks wtf is that all about who came up with the idea that a word is so offensive that it cannot be used under any circumstances and requires a code in lieu also we all know that n word means nigger and p word means paki so why are the codes any less offensive than the words themselves
sorry im confused you say that the pc brigade are intruding on private phonecalls to tell people not to be racist when this article certainly says nothing of the sort its examples are of someone giving an interview and of someone publishing their opinion for public consumption on the internet neither is even remotely comparable your argument would have some merit although not much if you were talking about pc invading your personal space you from telling racist jokes on the phone to your friends but that is not the subject of the article your personal space is not the world or the entire internet so if you broadcast your opinion to the world or the entire internet they are free to respond pc actually has very little to do with that they were free to tell you to shut up and stop being a stupid bigot  years ago  years ago  years ago even political correctness as the name implies was first and foremost about guidance for politicians and more generally to people addressing large audiences of anonymous people the idea that it has anything to do with what you and your friends do on the phone is facile if you feel that pc is preventing you from saying what you want to on the phone you need to ask whether maybe youve mistaken pc for your own conscience
there is a difference between being polite and selfcensorship because you are terrified of an oncoming twitter storm
hes only an actor why are you taking his comments so seriously
i think one major issue of so called political correctness is its arbitrary naturemidwife is fine but chairman is notusing ginger in the pejorative is fine but using black in the pejorative is not saying men cant multi task if fine but saying women cant read maps is notthats something ive always struggled with
what we are talking about is when someone is talking on the phone or talking with friends in these situations the pc would be the invader of a persons space but wheres the pc coming from no ones listening on the phone or stepping into groups of friends telling them what they can and cant say
the perennial backlash against pc language is due to the whiff of enforcement and control it carries with it which is patently absurd as there is almost no evidence of it i say almost because theres bound to be some deviation from the norm purely because of the nature of people the size of the sample and so forth virtually all evidence presented of the intrusion of political correctness with the backing of authority into the lives of normal people turns out to be completely false and usually originates from a few sources eg richard littlejohn and his contemporaries what we should ask is why are myths of insane authority so appealing that people will keep on believing them and passing them on rather than thinking that sounds stupid im going to google that and see if its actually true there is obviously some part of a certain psyche that wants to find evidence of oppression personally i put it down to white guilt straight guilt and so forth there are a lot of people who are responding to the suggestion that they might have been on the wrong side of history by perpetuating a myth and fabricating evidence that they are now suffering the wrath of those that they oppressed which makes it fair in their eyes and its ridiculous because no one is making these people feel guilty
if a person expresses bigoted views and is shouted down by a spontaneous public outcry they have nowhere to turn the masses are against them however with the introduction of state sanctioned speech patterns the bigot can now blame the powers that be for repressing his views whether or not this is in fact the case personally i dont believe people change very much especially once theyre older than  or so so when racistoffensive language is finally a matter for historians it will be because young people in this country have grown up among children of other races made friends with them come to love them and older people who could not adapt to a multiracial society have popped their clogs it will not be due to indoctrinationthroughlanguage
there is a whole sheaf of potential discussion which is basically rendered impossible because of accusations of racism antisemitism and so on unfortunately for your argument if those accusations are not true in the first instance their targets almost always attract the vocal support of people who absolutely are racist sexist homophobic and so on to make sure that they appear founded racists often claim that we cant talk about immigration because of political correctness and it is much like the guy who broke into your house complaining that everyone has to lock their doors at night because of crime being out of control pc doesnt exist gratuitously it exists in the vain hope of ensuring that such discussion can be had by making it obvious when someone has gone over from discussion into bigotry but its rather naïve because of course not all racists are completely clueless and some will always find ways to express their bigotry within whatever rules you set but really im not sure how important it would ever be to discuss a link between jewishness and fraud we can be  certain that you wouldnt be talking about a causal link so really thats a halfbaked premise for a discussion that should probably be investigated first and discussed later a lot of the worst debate results from people speculating about whether there might be causation and that speculation usually involves people who were already sure that there was before any evidence materialised and couldnt care less about proof really its not the kind of debate that we desperately need to preserve i would suggest
how can someone in their own space invade anothers space unless they come face to face what we are talking about is when someone is talking on the phone or talking with friends in these situations the pc would be the invader of a persons space in another public situation when a person expresses an opinion like in a debate the pc brigade attack that persons point of view fair enough you would say but it goes both ways if you express a pc opinion then you are entitled to be attacked on those views held by people who do not share those views if there are a group of you trying to force your viewpoint on others then it is reasonable for others to come to the aid of the person who is being verbally attacked
didnt someone get sacked in usa for using the word nigardly maybe all words beginning with n and having a vowel in it should be banned to be on the safe side
i ed a few in my  thread here changing christmas to holiday strikes me as particularly crass as was the sun has got his hat on incident
surely theres a usually clear distinction between abuse and frank speaking to use the nword and similar abusive terms is not justified as it adds nothing other than denigration however it can seem as if political correctness has gone too far when instead of stifling abuse it stifles discussion sometimes it is necessary or good to express an opinion which is unpopular because its part of a valid argument for example if i were to suggest that jews tended to indulge in fraud which is something i just made up i dont think this at all and i dont think theres any evidence to suggest this then i would get criticised for antisemitism but the point is that id be suggesting something that could in theory be true and if it were true then it would be an important issue for discussion we have to be able to discuss sensitive issues for clarity im actually quite projewish and proisrael i chose jews because to refer to eg community x doesnt focus the mind so well
within reason pc could be deemed a sensible extension of basic politeness but taken to the extremes we have today it has become farcical and is almost beyond parody can you be specific about what extremes you are referring to i ask because a lot of people cast vague aspersions about pc gone mad and a lot of their examples turn out to be either myths halftruths or not really anything to do with political correctness at all
i might send this interpretation to zizek so that he can laugh at it and then call it ztyüpit
there was an article in a a different newspaper a few years ago about the death of common sense we dont need political correctness we just need common sense theres a clear and obvious problem with that assertion nothing was stopping us using common sense before political correctness came about we relied on common sense and it turns out that common sense for some people is not to be racist while common sense to others is to be incredibly racist all the time it is the same with every law that forces people to do what their opponents claim is just common sense there was nothing stopping employers paying women and minorities an equal wage before equal pay laws were introduced and yet we know that they didnt do it where was common sense then the evidence of history clearly shows that common sense is a worthless term when say common sense do you declare that racists are not using common sense do you think that telling a racist just use common sense and youll be fine will result in that racist realising that his racism is not common sense common sense just means whatever i think everyone thinks and you must know if youve had any contact with undeniable racists sexists homophobes and so on that one of the first things theyll claim is that everyone thinks what they think but just wont say it political correctness exists because common sense was shown to have failed at every point before the civil rights movement and the feminist movement people were free to regard the need for equal treatment of women and minorities as common sense and yet the outcome of their common sense was that such people were legally unequal maybe you will say ahhh but they werent using common sense because they cant have been because they did something i dont agree with or maybe you will just think it either way youll be wrong if we learn anything from history its that common sense changes there is a good chance that your common sense will be regarded as backward and bigoted by your descendants just as the common sense of racists and sexists is by theirs political correctness exists because we acknowledge that common sense is not just different from era to era but from person to person racism is common sense to a racist sexism is common sense to a sexist and so on before and after equality became a legal right peoples common sense has not been enough to prevent them from being racists or sexists the fact that they had the approval of the law at the time does not mean that they were right although of course you could argue that agreeing with the law is common sense unless you believe that something happened during the th century which made women and minorities more deserving of equal treatment than they were in the th political correctness exists for people whose common sense would tell them to be racist or sexist it is there to say no matter how obvious it is to you that you should call that woman a slut youre wrong it states that some things are just objectively offensive and dont require personal judgment and it exists because people who swear blind that theyre not racist or sexist cannot accept that racism and sexism should be at least partly defined by women or minorities or in fact anyone other than themselves thats the real crux of it some people insist that theyre not racist or sexist but act like they are pc is giving them the benefit of a doubt and saying that they arent just massive liars that they are trying not to be racist or sexist but are not succeeding pc isnt for people who are racist and proud its for people who we hope dont want to be racist and just end up there by accident
the question is why ever do actors think their thoughts are incredibly insightful because other people talk as if their words necessarily resonate in the wider world but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone his outburst actually reveals very little about how far resistance to pc has gone as its just his words whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense imo thats because the definition of those terms has been over sensitively and nonsensically widened to include disagreeing with my worldview usually by people who feel better about themselves when condemning others and take pleasure in doing so
deleting comments is in no way censorship you are free to be as unpleasant as you choose in other forums in your personal life or to start your own blog thank you i wish more people would say this so that it is more widely acknowledged some people seem to have some vey strange ideas about what free speech covers specifically they seem to believe that it includes the right to have your opinion published wherever you want to see it published it is akin to claiming that your notes inside a copy of mobydick must appear in all subsequent publications of the novel and if they dont your free speech has been violated i suppose its because the privilege of commenting on news articles is so readily afforded that people just assumes that its a right but of course it isnt a lot of the rabid antipc mob dont seem to grasp the concept of tacit permission of course as you point out any of these people who complains about their comments being deleted from someone elses property which is what a website is is free to start up their own website and put their own opinions on it and it wont be censored unless they choose to censor it the reason they dont of course is that they are not merely interested in expressing themselves but expressing themselves to a wide audience that someone else has accumulated they know that their blog would get nexttozero traffic in the short term and would rather put their views forward in a forum that has clearly come to see someone else which has been arranged and set up by others and which has given other permission to comment
firstly im impressed to see anyone complaining about the lack of representation of racists in the media secondly just out of movies ive seen recently anchorman  portrayed its central character as an overt racist thirdly there are huge numbers of racist characters on tv with their racism presented as parody for some and as just unironically hilarious racism for others if all hollywood movies have suddenly stopped slipping racist or homophobic lines into the dialogue of ordinary characters rather than characters who have virtually no personality beyond their vices as with filth then its a pretty recent change i see zero evidence that pc has taken over scriptwriting hollywood is an industry where it has been acceptable in recent years for companies to announce that they wont be making films with female leads for a while because they havent been doing so well hollywood is quite conservative in terms of how it spends its money and its superficial embrace of pc which as far as i can tell from this comments section means anything from multiculturalism to not actually arresting minorities for being minorities to health and safety law is simply a result of the fact that if a movie is going to draw an audience from all races sexes and sexualities you dont want to piss them off just to appeal to a minority of straight white men who cant get off unless erin brokovich expresses her disgust at lesbianism at some point hollywood still relies on the same broadly sexist racist and homophobic tropes that it always has it just tries not to actively piss off minorities for no reason
so to sum up deleting comments is in no way censorship you are free to be as unpleasant as you choose in other forums in your personal life or to start your own blog discouraging offensive language very much does affect the way society views the other people do respond to societys condemnation and having to consider their language makes them consider the thoughts and actions behind the language we have seen this time and again throughout history a bitter and relentless minority of alf garnetts will always kick and rail and demand their right to be vocal about their bigotry but overall we move forward by no longer encouraging or turning a blind eye to ugly hateful language doing nothing changes nothing if societal disapproval of ugly hateful language did not work so well there would be no outcry against it by those who are angry that their views are now in the minority and finally people pointing out to you that they find your openly and vocally expressed views to be hateful and bigoted does not make you a victim you have a right to express hateful ideas others have a right to point out that it is deeply unpleasant and unnecessary as always i do not reply to trolls or abusive people so feel free to have at me and regardless real life beckons
i think its most true to say that language influences thought which in turn influences actions which in turn influences reality if we know that a leads to b b leads to c and c leads to d why should we pretend that a does not lead to d
i think the fallacy is that language creates reality language may do this to a small extent but it reflects internal thought to a far greater degree and to assume otherwise is to betray a rather low opinion of normal peoples intelligence imho the real reason that relations between races in this country has improved is that people in the prime of adult life have now grown up among children of other races dictating peoples language is the tail wagging the dog
cultural marxism is about the people having control of culture and not allowing either the state or a small number of influential people dictating culture ive never heard the phrase used that way before you do understand that a lot of misguided people sincerely believe that racism and sexism are by definition oneway streets you do understand the degree to which they are poisoning the discourse and the need for some kind of label for their fallacious beliefs i dont really care about arbitrary leftright tribalism so ill ignore the rest
its amazing how many people are willing to devote time and effort to stating that pc ie telling people that its maybe not a great idea to use the nword if youre not sure how it will be received is an affront to free speech last time i checked the right to free speech was not the right to blanket approval or tacit indifference to whatever you say they just dont put you in jail for it it is amazing that people are able to treat what essentially amounts to a list of suggestions with broad support like such a serious threat
thats one small step for humans one giant leap for humankind yes that would have been equally effective not sure why you believe otherwise however nobody at all is suggesting we change those words or that those words present a problem odd comment really
the problem he was probably trying to get that is that almost all hollywood characters these day are pc and certainly boring when was the last time a blockbuster film had an awful character in that was either homophobic or racist and was the main character why cant a main hollywood character just be racist it would get the audience something to chew on rather than mind numbing avengersesk films honestly watch a film called filth starring james mcavoy the character is racist homophobic etc etc and the film has stayed with me much longer than and informed me an a whole lot of crap but pc has taken over scriptwriting its about pcgtart when it should be artgtpc
i do think gary oldman has a point though it may not have come across at least in this mised piece there was an article in a a different newspaper a few years ago about the death of common sense we dont need political correctness we just need common sense political correctness is an attempt to outlaw certain language that might be deemed offensive it criminalizes free speech the problem with having a law against everything is it turns everyone into a criminal and if the law does not respect peoples right to exercise common sense people will not respect the law this imho is why we are having a backlash my own mother who is in her s has contraband in her house in that she has a collection of golliwogs collected when i was a child by sending off jam lables now this is seen as racist is my mother racist no the pc brigade has taken it on themselves to be offended on behalf of minorities when the majority of the time no offense is intended free speech is an important concept freedom to believe what you want even more so most important however to democracy is freedom to agree to disagree in todays paper david cameron is openly disagreeing with the rest of europe despite it almost certainly being futile what would the world be like if mr cameron was not able to state his view for fear of being ostracized by his peers the most important thing my father told me when i was young and being bullied was sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me perhaps if we all believed this there would be no need for political correctness
encouraging the removal of vile language from the everyday vernacular discourages the notion that it is acceptable to think of other human beings in offensive terms nobody is being prevented from saying bigoted hateful things however they have been forced to learn that if they wish to say unpleasant things about other human beings they may very well now receive public and societal condemnation this affects them and very much does effect a change in peoples behaviour we have seen this throughout history it is very odd that some people shout very loudly that they must be allowed to say anything they want but do not wish others to be allowed to freely respond to them and disagree with them thats why the majority of bigots kick and rail against the now common public disapprobation of bigoted language so furiously they know it works but certainly continuing to educate people as to why decent people do not speak about other human beings in a bigoted fashion is commendable and useful too
we still have societies not interested in equalityif you think the progressives view themselves as just plain ole ordinary folk you havent talked to themtheir existence is based on they know better than anyone else which comes from a sense of superiority therefore equality can not be possible
neil armstrongs iconic words wouldnt quite have had the same resonance if they had been put through the pc filter and emerged as thats one small step for a human one giant leap for humankind
the perennial backlash against pc language is due to the whiff of enforcement and control it carries with it its a top down approach which runs counter to the bottom up nature of vernacular language many people when told they are forbidden by their betters from doing something will think to hell with you ill dosay what i like even though they would agree with the goals change peoples minds first then language usage will follow naturally
in other words pc is about imposing a particular range of views on those who do not subscribe to them a view that people deserve at least a basic level of respect not to attack insult or denigrate them for what should be nonissues such as race gender or sexual orientation if you really dont subscribe to that view you dont have a place in modern society
fortunately deleting comments is not in any way censorship anyone who wishes to say hateful bigoted things is free to do so all over the internet and in their personal lives guardians comment section guardians rules
when i hear the word racist now theres a good chance that the word was used incorrectly the over use of the word to shout down debate or people you dont like has become the norm and pc politics is totally to blame for this
it has become banal and even tyrannical to try to argue for language and behaviour that respects women and minorities wrong it has become acceptable it seems to use language that is bigotted against middle aged white men but not towards other groups equality is good and fine but many of those pushing for it seem satisfied that middle aged white men are a legitimate target it is now this hypocricy that is now ruining your pc crusade
what right has an unknown nobody got to come into someones personal space and say dont say that dont express that dont even think that the same right as that person has to express something racist sexist etc to others a similar invasion of their personal space
thats actorist i think they prefer the term female actor 
the tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum when people like you talk about equality you are talking about equality of outcome not equality of opportunity that is widely and correctly perceived as an attack on basic fairness
absolutely you are yes your representation of oldman in this piece is essentially to use him as a strawman to prop up your not totally incorrect argument in the context of your article it makes it look like that he complaining that you cant get away with saying everything you ed in general whereas what he actually was complaining about was the hypocrisy and double standards behind the media and general public he doesnt imply that its normal to do so he says that in moments of anger we have all said things that we regret and to judge people solely on their worst moments is pretty unfair now in regards to who he is defending i dont think he has a good point at all mel gibson in particular has been outed on multiple occasions as generally being a nasty piece of work but it doesnt change his point at large in regards to his comments on women he specifically cites comedians as people who are largely allowed to get away with nastier comments he is commenting on the idea that we have sacred cows people who are allowed to get away with things because of their position in society i will admit that generally i think that people are too easily offended one reason that there is backlash against political correctness is because it is all too often blind to context that isnt to say that people shouldnt endeavour to be more pc but when people try to control other peoples behaviour and thoughts they are going to inevitably cause arguments especially when you are trying to police something as changeable and nuanced as social convention
pc means being a black british visiting the us and people calling you africanamerican so as not to offend youalso pc means avoiding to use the word negro spanish for black anymore in greece because the term n same root totally different word has a negative connotation in the us also pc is censoring yourself because you know your comment might be moderated otherwise if you write the word nigger
wow some serious actor hate going on here the hate that dare speak its name cos you know theyre only actors replace actor with any minority and hear your own prejudice and bigotry reflected back at you
once again a reason to admire the genius of the late great mr mayall
neither is being referred to as a scrounger when youve worked hard all your life or having your health problems being described as wishy washy because they happen to be mental
to say nothing of fgm one of the truly great evils of our time
it seems that the main thing shown is that it is impossible to speak the simple truth wheres the truth in nigger amp faggot you rightwingers sure love defending bigotrywhy is that
but certain sections of society are prone to doing offensive things then telling us we shouldnt complain about it because its offensive such as
pc is an attack on a persons freedom of speech freedom of expression and freedom of thought what right has an unknown nobody got to come into someones personal space and say dont say that dont express that dont even think that if you allow yourself to be intimidated by the actions of this type of person you are inviting these people into your lives and is the first stage in the brainwashing technique employed by these people to change your way of thinking to their way a simple fuck off and mind your own business lets these people know that they cannot step all over you
if you want to be funny or create humour then just spend a bit more time thinking about it first i think its possible to be caustic and funny without being racist sexisthomophobic or bigotted language evolves but so can we as humans
get off my plane
there can be no doubt that the various media offendeds have become the new inquisition and they enjoy their auto de fes as much as their spanish predecessors did when they find a victim to vomit their faux outrage over a perfect example of rightwing idiocy and their pathological need to constantly portray the bigot and racist as the real victims because being criticised for using racial slurs is just like being a victim of the spanish inquisition
what pc outragethe islamic fundamentalists may have been outraged but i dont think you can call that political correctness theres a world of difference
one presumes that she means that the language we use and hear used can affect our perception of the world in a radical way exactly this morning on radio a reporter declared that a non kinetic drone was one with no weaponry im sure she really knew what kinetic means but felt obliged to go along with army doublespeak of which there are plenty of examples collateral damage being the most notorious
and my point was that such suppositions are relative my refusal of the authors possible authoritarianism is not by definition authoritarian no its not authoritarian telling someone not to do something is no more authoritarian than saying something must be done its you who felt the use of a word or command was sufficient from which to establish compulsion
no you are arguing that the direct precedent is of no example it is then up to you to determine in what way it is not a useful example which ive done its not representative of the usual trajectory in matters relating to social change its an outlier of it taken in context must and abandon are very absolutist there are dozens of other ways in which that could have been written the profiling of the language appears a little bitter even why abandon why not encompass new words this is not a trivial discernment here re abandon hes talking about the restrictions rather than the words themselves and i think it would be an odd argument to say lets keep the restrictions but extend them given that he doesnt think restrictions are helpful as to must ive just noticed its not a word he himself uses but i dont think its a word that inherently suggests compulsion i expected him to use a better construct to be a better writer then if youre going to fall back on a plea to linguistic vagarity hes a professional no but most calls for change dont encompass calls for criminal prosecution and nor are calls for criminal prosecution inherent in the words he uses so it would be odd to specify that he didnt mean something which was not suggested in the text itself your objections rest not on what he writes or how but your assessment of his politics in the context of your views of other political or social activists my suggestion is as follows less capricious language and less disjoint dismissal in your arguments would help all concerned thanks for your suggestion but with the greatest of respect youre not someone i would look to for lessons regarding the use of language or argument
i do speak from a position of white heterosexual privilege but kids just work this out they call the significant people in their lives by whatever name makes sense to them in their family life they know who is important and how to refer to them when they are talking about them its us adults that confuse the issue
i thought that too the names that the writer came up with for he and his husband were hardly shatteringly new papa and daddy once you coin a new word and start using it it gets used
how arrogant are you the name means to lead someone easily it came from a joke between me and a friend and it has fuck all to do with you have you finished now or do i have to explain to you one more time because i think ive made it as simple as i can for you
unfortunately or exemplary the only precedent in this area suggests the role of criminality and so my use of precedent is not in any way selective of course it is that the youre now claiming that its the only precedent in this area is exactly that because the area is how to achieve social change and clearly the only precedent in relation to that is not the canadian bill there are many examples in which social change has happened that doesnt consist of criminalising people in order to achieve it those are lies i did not claim the absolute that he is seeking regulation but rather that his text is suggestive thereof your first response to me said but dont start a rallying cry to compel acceptance and dont publish articles and consider too the host of the article here with such rallying cries you were clearly saying he was calling for compulsion elsewhere you said my dont then comprises the position that one should not produce articles insisting on language regulation insisting is very different to being suggestive of no lying on my part when one describes the appreciation of biological relationship as tyranny yes i think one rather would take offense at it he didnt say an appreciation of biological relationships was a tyranny one can appreciate them without believing that they are superior i dont think as you suggested the most proportionate response is for all straight people to take offence
im just going to short this one here no im saying youre not being authoritarian just as im saying the author isnt i dont believe that the use of the word must or dont involves compulsion and my point was that such suppositions are relative my refusal of the authors possible authoritarianism is not by definition authoritarian
no im saying precedents should be used correctly no you are arguing that the direct precedent is of no example it is then up to you to determine in what way it is not a useful example yes but me saying for instance homophobic abuse must end doesnt necessitate me saying that it should be criminalised thats a logical leap correct however the next step could well indeed be criminalization because not the outcome of all arguments doesnt lie in argumentation alone yet criminalization is not certain as you say the next step might instead be a kind of social justicestyle shaming designed to browbeat people into accepting a new social paradigm taken in context must and abandon are very absolutist there are dozens of other ways in which that could have been written the profiling of the language appears a little bitter even why abandon why not encompass new words this is not a trivial discernment here you expected him to explicitly say that he wasnt calling for criminal sanctions i expected him to use a better construct to be a better writer then if youre going to fall back on a plea to linguistic vagarity hes a professional no i dont think youve engaged with the argument made in the article at all so no so youre not really attempting to make the case that i have not engaged with the argument in favour of a simple invocation of orwell but my point regarding orwell was that the specific reference didnt make your point as to likely negative outcomes more substantive i have no idea where this particular point is going and am not investigating further my suggestion is as follows less capricious language and less disjoint dismissal in your arguments would help all concerned
i do though have a problem with women being reduced to incubators or men reduced to sperm donors more the former than the latter in order create a child for a third party i can see there are issues with that and think some of the focus around assisted reproduction does fall foul of that and sometimes into outright exploitation the example of the guy in the article who was the real parent because he thought of it does rather minimise the physical work that goes into having a child but i think this is where we diverge i know assisted reproduction is more prevalent amongst straight rather than gay couples but they dont start a relationship with the intention of using surrogates or donors in this way i am concerned as to the implications for society if the practice becomes widespread it has a greater chance of being widespread amongst opposite sex couples than it does gay couples if only because theres a whole lot more of the former so to discuss it in terms that focus on the latter doesnt really address the ethical issues or likely to halt the prevalence of it i dont think the intentions behind the relationship make a difference here ethical considerations dont fall away or are less important just because straight couples assume that children will come easily to them that suggests something like an entitlement to ignore these concerns due to ideas over what is natural and not
youre being very selective in the precedents youre using there are many ways in which social change is achieved that do not involve criminalisation unfortunately or exemplary the only precedent in this area suggests the role of criminality and so my use of precedent is not in any way selective the author may be calling for a variety of things but as weve already discussed does use a slightly questionable perspective its not the most extreme presentation clearly but doesnt exclude worse in making such narratives we risk more than the original question unless were extremely careful in our description otherwise we end up with the likes of privilege being injected into every discussion of sociality yes you misrepresented it you claim it calls for compulsion you claim he is seeking regulation those are lies i did not claim the absolute that he is seeking regulation but rather that his text is suggestive thereof again please dont lie about the content of the discussion thanks i suppose its easier than engaging with the argument instead you just indicated it meant people should take offence at it when one describes the appreciation of biological relationship as tyranny yes i think one rather would take offense at it they also on occasion write in to explicitly take up with that argument sometimes the other party has a more distal appreciation of this fact rather like a drama inside a drama no d
so what youre describing isnt anything akin to an active thought police but the means by which society gradually changes in any direction bemoan that if you like but calling it thought police is just stilly
i think you and i reading the ambiguous text differently i had understood he wasnt interested in being a donor but would love to be a father as meaning he wanted to care for the child but not be its biological father having thought about it i think your reading is correct but globaviewpoints snarky post is still wrong because the biological father is very possibly the one not recognised by the school
can we categories this as fake news in a funny kind of way it is linked logically it should not surprise us that the first words in almost everyones experience mum dad and the family relations not to mention the personal pronouns present us with difficulties when family structures and sexual identity begins to shift and change it is because these words form the basis of something much more foundational than a merely lexical structure they form the basis of our lives as social creatures when we try to change things at this level which is what i think andrew solomon is hoping to do then some people are going to be upset literally these words form the basic anchoring points that people try to use in order to build more complex structures ie life this is why it made me think of fake news when we tinker with these basic master signifiers other things start to wobble and collapse perhaps not for you personally at least not all of the time but maybe for other people losing ones mind is rarely a laughing matter losing the coordinates with which to judge truth and fiction can be a physically dizzying experience changing ones mind is possible but because our minds touch our bodies and language is fundamental to this it might be wise to take a bit of care
you would have to be obsessively antitrump to shoehorn him into a comment under this article since political correctness and its stifling of free expression isnt on his agenda maybe if you had instead slipped in obama or hillary it would have worked since unlike trump they could arguably be accused of being cardcarrying agendabenders
how thick are you the verb is lead and the past tense and past participle are spelled led not lead
being the acceptance of peoples ability to choose to live their lives so long as it doesnt impige on anothers right to the same degree i have no issue with that who asks the re unconceived child how they want to live theirs such social reengineering might be better know by a single word selfishness
another way of looking at it is that relatively small numbers of people should not dictate to the majority about how they should speak and think youre at the wrong newspaper buddy thats their entire reason to exist
too otherwise agreed
its worked well for tens of thousands of years but todays gender studies grads know better
had to slip it in there didnt they i think its actually compulsary
biological fatherhood isnt transient though
children dont inherently mind any family structure as long as they are loved and cared for were not born to expect one mum one dad and  children if you look back through history and across different cultures thats actually quite a rarity a more loose extended family tribal setup has been more the norm with children often cared for by people who are not their parents
there we have it the liberal psychosis in a nutshell not content to control ones own life but to control the lives of everyone else strange how authoritarians think of themselves as liberal
which bit or just all of it
the salami being the acceptance of peoples ability to choose to live their lives in a way other than yours and not have to either hide it or apologise for it what are you talking about sorry you find that so upsetting and difficult to accept i expect youll cope in the end somehow see previous question
yeah i dont believe you
comment of the year so far
matthew king james version kjv and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven gods word is clear it is a direct disobedience to god to call churchmen father papa or pope

words i think i actually need a diagram to explain some e of these relationships to me there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family how kind of you to say so
in an ideal society people would not be able to ask innocent questions like so are you his dad then at the school gates without risking fines exclusion and imprisonment i really hope youre joking but since this is the guardian i fear you might be serious first the lefties push to curb free speech where it disagrees with them then the progressive march towards establishing the thought police
well i was ing from a tv programme and my memory isnt what it used to be i googled it and found httpswwwquoracomiscousinmarriagelegalinindia so now i think the programme i watched was something to do with hindu sapinda relationships india is a vast and complex continent so i suppose it all depends on customs and usage in particular regions in addition to religion
translation thought police suggestions in an article about linguistic ways of accepting varied life choices not exactly the stasi is it no and it would be outed and resisted if it obviously were but it is one of many drip drip drips of malign cultural adjustment that has quietly brought us to the straits we are in today its the cultural equivalent if the eus acquis or ratchet one thin salami slice at a time and pretty soon youve sliced the whole salami without anyone noticing just letting people know theres a salami on the table thats all
i wasnt trying to make a point about same sex marriage per se i personally have no problem with it and neither do i have a problem with gay or straight couples adopting children who would otherwise not be a part of a family i do though have a problem with women being reduced to incubators or men reduced to sperm donors more the former than the latter in order create a child for a third party i know assisted reproduction is more prevalent amongst straight rather than gay couples but they dont start a relationship with the intention of using surrogates or donors in this way i am concerned as to the implications for society if the practice becomes widespread but then i am equally concerned about some of the other aspects of genetic engineering eg cloning or three parent embryos as i indicated i think there is a spiritual aspect to procreation it is not just a bodily function
hear hear
its not only indiani am british caucasian and when i was brought up in the s all my parents friends and our neighbours were auntie sue etc
no it really isnt maybe you want it to be but its simply not true i think your prejudices are showing
two of the three of them have no biological relationship to the child the father and the woman who bore the child assuming from her own egg as it doesnt say otherwise will certainly be biologically related to it unless something even more miraculous happened
i get that he was primarily talking about fatuous comments i read the piece this is the para i am referring to its damning with faint praise and oh lord i have to put this in worldweariness condescending in my view there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family its an ageold arrangement for bringing up children and it can work beautifully i raise no objection to it ive written that i admire sullivan and i do doesnt mean i have to agree with everything he publishes
i think ms has been incredibly successful certainly in formalbusiness correspondence there has been a tendency in some quarters to use msmrsmr as the options as oppose to msmr as intended though ive been less aware of it of late i queried this once and was told that ms was used for unmarried women on the assumption that we didnt want to admit we were unmarried spot the obvious logic fail a lot of the authors complaints could be addressed by people using the words we already have correctly for instance people using the phrase real parent in the contexts mentioned could just be informed that biological parent is more accurate you cant address peoples innocenceindifferenceignorance of science andor the details of your family structure simply by giving them more vocabulary to misuse
the guardian tends to throw the word must around like confetti it is one of the words i dislike the most along with should and ought these words reveal an arrogance on the part of those that use them as though they are wiser than those they speak to they are pushy patronising and preachy words that signify an agenda
and not to buy mccain roasties as good as mums or fried chicken as good as mum makes
in  the totalitarian government had created a new language as a tool of social control im not sure how that relates to this call for a new vocabulary to enable people to easily and accurately describe their family situations noone is suggesting that it will be made compulsory as far as i can see

the relevant precedents in hate speech legislation lack the element of compulsion youre being very selective in the precedents youre using there are many ways in which social change is achieved that do not involve criminalisation therefore there are precedents to show this is not inherent or likely that this is what the author is calling for i know thats why i didnt do it if you step into the public sphere expect comment yes you misrepresented it you claim it calls for compulsion you claim he is seeking regulation you said he was calling all heterosexuals tyrannical none of that is in the text itself anyway when one uses terms like biological tyranny people are apt to make conclusions about the character of the argument i suppose its easier than engaging with the argument instead you just indicated it meant people should take offence at it
again you are arguing the irrelevancy of precedent no im saying precedents should be used correctly there is a precedent of a man who drinks beating his wife it does not follow that all men who drink beat their wives or are likely to you have given no mediating factors that might produce an alternate outcome at all that many people argue for changes to things that dont lead to punitive sanctions being involved that most arguments that things must change dont lead to or include calls that people be punished for not doing along with it the canadian bill is an outlier yet you are using it as if it is standard and yet such laws may be misused and it seems likely that they will be yes but me saying for instance homophobic abuse must end doesnt necessitate me saying that it should be criminalised thats a logical leap there are plenty of ways to obtain societal change without criminalising it or using sanctions that it could do and that sometimes laws are misused would not be sufficient basis to say im wrong to say that homophobic abuse must end or that its some form of repression one would have hoped that it were absolutely excluded by the argument you expected him to explicitly say that he wasnt calling for criminal sanctions still youre demonstrating my point illegitimate usage is possible and under the auspices of reactionaries likely i dont think youve demonstrated the second point at all youre really attempting to make the case that i have not engaged with the argument in favour of a simple invocation of orwell i dont think youve engaged with the argument made in the article at all so no but my point regarding orwell was that the specific reference didnt make your point as to likely negative outcomes more substantive
hes not just talking about what terms are used but also what relationships are recognised see references to schools and legal parenthood its an issue that stems beyond just calling yourself mum all right i can agree with that then the problems he complains of will continue youre right its a possibility he believes that there should be some form of compulsion its also possible that he does not believe that but its speculation guess work based on a negative view of those who share his politics its speculation based on precedent and so i will continue to cast a skeptical eye on this if all well well if not not but youre being selective in your use of precedents most people making these arguments dont call for punishment of those who dont agree most changes in terminology are not accompanied by punishment for those who dont use them therefore the relevant precedents are the lack of compulsion the relevant precedents in hate speech legislation lack the element of compulsion you have no trouble with misrepresentation of the article i know thats why i didnt do it if you step into the public sphere expect comment not that i think given that you felt that heterosexuals were right to be irate about the article as it was offensive to them its a misrepresentation puerile or otherwise a little too late for such exculpation im afraid anyway when one uses terms like biological tyranny people are apt to make conclusions about the character of the argument sometimes these will be welljustified even you arent sure about his position and i think that warrants a stance in this case
this has nothing to do with my argument immediately above which i suspect is why you wrote the following of course it relates to your argument you imposed onto the argument the idea that it was mandatory that there was some element of compulsion involved sorry but thats a separate issue you can argue that hes not calling for it to be mandatory but by making the case that i instead am being authoritarian no im saying youre not being authoritarian just as im saying the author isnt i dont believe that the use of the word must or dont involves compulsion youre insisting that must and dont are authoritarian in usage uniformly actually im arguing the opposite my dont then comprises the position that one should not produce articles insisting on language regulation based only on the use of the word must you take that to necessarily involve an element of compulsion or regulation that is the only thing within the text that you cite in support of your claim that hes calling for compulsion

its lazy andor dishonest you choose to find a single precedent and then take it to be inherent or the inevitable outcome of any tangentially related issue again you are arguing the irrelevancy of precedent i can imagine little more ludicrous than that you have given no mediating factors that might produce an alternate outcome at all you may instead choose as to whether your argument is indeed lazy or simply intellectually bankrupt to make it inherent or an inevitable outcome of any argument about the use of language there needs to be evidence of this happening on a widespread basis yes ive already supplied parallel information on this hate speech laws exist and typically with good reason and yet such laws may be misused and it seems likely that they will be so no your refutation of precedent doesnt wash the point of this is whilst it is possible that someone might call for compulsion when seeking change it is not an inherent part of the argument one would have hoped that it were absolutely excluded by the argument but i suppose thats as good as im going to get out of this still youre demonstrating my point illegitimate usage is possible and under the auspices of reactionaries likely to insist that it is just avoids engaging with the argument itself in favour of tired old tropes about censorship and orwell i genuinely laughed when i read this youre really attempting to make the case that i have not engaged with the argument in favour of a simple invocation of orwell this is bizarre in the extreme im perfectly happy with novel descriptions of familial relationships but think it unusual that they wouldnt habitually follow classical parallels no more of this nonsense if you please
or auntyuncle if they are the next generation up
such statements demean the lives of billions globally whove given birth and are in loving heterosexual relationships hes not criticising them for that though hes criticising those who ask fatuous questions about who is the real parent even though non genetic parenting arrangements like adoption have been going on for centuries

the law requiring the use of mummy and daddy to describe the classical nuclear relationship hes not just talking about what terms are used but also what relationships are recognised see references to schools and legal parenthood its an issue that stems beyond just calling yourself mum again the difference between ought and must if the suggestion fails then what then the problems he complains of will continue youre right its a possibility he believes that there should be some form of compulsion its also possible that he does not believe that but its speculation guess work based on a negative view of those who share his politics why does this require a change in terminology the article explains why precedent is the greatest indicator of future intention or there can be no deduction nor induction but youre being selective in your use of precedents most people making these arguments dont call for punishment of those who dont agree most changes in terminology are not accompanied by punishment for those who dont use them therefore the relevant precedents are the lack of compulsion lets not belittle the issue shall we ive already made my position clear so theres no maturity to be had in such a puerile misrepresentation you have no trouble with misrepresentation of the article not that i think given that you felt that heterosexuals were right to be irate about the article as it was offensive to them its a misrepresentation puerile or otherwise
no im saying that the use of such terms is not inherently authoritarian ideas of compulsion should not be imposed onto it this has nothing to do with my argument immediately above which i suspect is why you wrote the following also youre not doing that given that hes not said such terms be mandatory youre demanding nothing more than the author not use the word must sorry but thats a separate issue you can argue that hes not calling for it to be mandatory but by making the case that i instead am being authoritarian your word then youve stipulated to my impression with respect to my own argument ill explain since you seem to need it youre insisting that must and dont are authoritarian in usage uniformly my dont then comprises the position that one should not produce articles insisting on language regulation if you dont agree to the second half you cant take up the position of the first of course you can back down off your original insistence if you like done and done

no well not the daily mail which is quite progressive here the dm uses love child
i would imagine the emphasis upon the primacy of the biological connection between parent and child over other forms of parental relationship some of that can stem from law some of that towards attitudes from others who dont recognise nonbiological parents as being true parents the law requiring the use of mummy and daddy to describe the classical nuclear relationship okay let me check my charters which law is this altleft cute avoids the point that the guardian doesnt wield much political power wed have a very different country if it did speaking as a real communist thank god that it doesnt ive seen some of the maniacal propositions this journals writers come up with theres nothing cute about the altleft of course it doesnt follow that he would want to criminalise or prosecute people for not doing so thats an absurd claim well now were into a huge maybe here maybe he would given the power to do so others certainly want such power and given the kind of political chops required to write for the graun i wouldnt be terribly surprised again the difference between ought and must if the suggestion fails then what he talks about the right for families to define themselves why does this require a change in terminology referencing orwell is not in itself an argument and im not dismissing legal precedents elsewhere im saying that the existence of one does not mean its the inevitable outcome of these arguments or the intent of all those who make them precedent is the greatest indicator of future intention or there can be no deduction nor induction the outcome of my suspicions visavis legal precedent are literally not my problem and calling such deduction lazy is the absolute epitome of intellectual corruption andor disjunction im not andrew and i think if you took the time to read the article and see it as something other than an attempt to oppress heterosexuals youd have a better chance of understanding it lets not belittle the issue shall we ive already made my position clear so theres no maturity to be had in such a puerile misrepresentation most calls for political or social change dont incorporate claims for sanctions against those who dont comply
your argument is now literally that by demanding that people not introduce a mandatory set of terms to refer to parents i am being authoritarian also youre not doing that given that hes not said such terms be mandatory youre demanding nothing more than the author not use the word must
no im saying that the use of such terms is not inherently authoritarian ideas of compulsion should not be imposed onto it
noted but dont try this is northern ireland
thats a senseless word salad its lazy somehow to infer from precedent okay its lazy andor dishonest you choose to find a single precedent and then take it to be inherent or the inevitable outcome of any tangentially related issue oh so for this to be properly orwellian there have to be multiple attempts to introduce such legislation to make it inherent or an inevitable outcome of any argument about the use of language there needs to be evidence of this happening on a widespread basis yes i suppose i should be happy that you recognize the actuality of such legislation at all why i always did so the uk has no hate speech laws no precedent at all on which the foundation of pronoun offense could be built it has hate speech laws but thats not the same thing as this being what someone is inherently calling or an inevitable aspect of such arguments for instance exactly the same argument youre making here was made regarding samesex marriage that to change the terminology so that a couple could be husband and husband would lead to an outcome in which those who didnt agree would be sanctioned that has yet to happen the point of this is whilst it is possible that someone might call for compulsion when seeking change it is not an inherent part of the argument to insist that it is just avoids engaging with the argument itself in favour of tired old tropes about censorship and orwell shall i pretend i dont know the answer already no feel free to be open about your mindreading abilities although im not sure what any of your responses have to do with my initial comment
im guessing you dont actually believe me if not which bit and why not i dont think the figures in our school are massively out of step with national averages apart from the number of adopted children which is unusually high for various reasons regarding the samesex couples something like  of the uk population identify themselves as heterosexual but only  or identify as gay or lesbian im guessing that the real figure is somewhere between the  suggested by the first figure and the who actually answered the question in the survey and that for whatever reason of local demographics weve got a somewhat higher percentage of children from such households than national average
do we still use bastard to describe children born out of wedlock
i think this is a bit of graun selfparody well done
that is an insane equivocation your argument is now literally that by demanding that people not introduce a mandatory set of terms to refer to parents i am being authoritarian
yes apparently now that dna tests are more common studies are showing that  in  or even  in  of people tests are not actually the child of both their parents like they thought they werewhich matters not a bit to me parenthood is about loving your child the one you live with and raise and care for but it does rather puncture the i could only love my own child brigade
its lazy or dishonest to insist that this is either an inevitable outcome of such arguments above or that this is what the author himself is calling for thats a senseless word salad its lazy somehow to infer from precedent okay i did like this justification though multiple attempts to introduce similar legislation oh so for this to be properly orwellian there have to be multiple attempts to introduce such legislation i suppose i should be happy that you recognize the actuality of such legislation at all i see so the uk has no hate speech laws no precedent at all on which the foundation of pronoun offense could be built shall i pretend i dont know the answer already
yes youre demanding that people dont do something
mine is a pragmatic not ideological observation and im not opposed to language that promotes inclusion and equality and in fact i encourage it its just that statistically speaking at this time the outliers are to remote to force such a fundamental paradigm shift
should have gone to spec savers granddad
okay so what is this biological tyranny then who is implementing it i would imagine the emphasis upon the primacy of the biological connection between parent and child over other forms of parental relationship some of that can stem from law some of that towards attitudes from others who dont recognise nonbiological parents as being true parents that is patently not all heterosexuals oh i expect theyre a yardstick of altleft thought these days they usually possess all the correct benchmark characteristics altleft cute avoids the point that the guardian doesnt wield much political power wed have a very different country if it did lets ask this what happens if he having the power to do so selects a list of approved words for parents and some people refuse to use them its the difference in presentation between must and ought it doesnt follow that he would want to criminalise or prosecute people for not doing so thats an absurd claim most calls for political or social change dont incorporate claims for sanctions against those who dont comply the conclusion references nothing whatsoever about terminology it covers the equality of validity in heterosexual and homosexual and mixedfamily parenting this is not terminology he talks about the right for families to define themselves yes legal precedent elsewhere must simply be dismissed much like counterreferencing orwell with an ironic twist is an argument and youre saying i had no basis to find fault here referencing orwell is not in itself an argument and im not dismissing legal precedents elsewhere im saying that the existence of one does not mean its the inevitable outcome of these arguments or the intent of all those who make them who is preventing you from using different language for varied genderparent roles andrew im not andrew and i think if you took the time to read the article and see it as something other than an attempt to oppress heterosexuals youd have a better chance of understanding it but again if law and those around you dont recognise ones use of language or the validity of particular familial relationships it severely undermines the ability to have these
lol yeah i believe you mate
because one of them has no biological relationship with the child eh unless something miraculous has happened two of the three of them have no biological relationship to the child but only one of them isnt recognised as a parent by the school which shows why its all a bit arbitrary and daft
again only in the narrowest of conceptions let me make this more clear for you my dont here comprises my opposition to people writing articles that demand changes to language use not quite the same case is it
morval hindrance whose post you were replying to specified african tribes you thought that was something we could emulate the problems of infant mortality age of consent and female consent in general need to be addressed these tribes are likely to be close family units after all they are tribes not the equivalent of an english village you cant just adopt the nice commune bit and expect everyone else to cluster round to support unrelated children financially or in any other way
you mean like when you want to know something about your child and the biggest online source is mumsnet and the biggest local shop is mothercare and the product they recommend says used by mums for  years on ityou stand there as a man and think do they not think i exist
of course you can use mother when you are talking about a motherbut when you are talking about a parent why not say parentfor example i am a father i use childcare yesterday there was an article about how expensive childcare is and how it harms mothers it harms all parents who use childcare so why use language that only mentions one gender of parent
after thousands of generations of language developing organically you have to be delusional or arrogant on donald trumps level to try to bend it to your agendabtw noone using the repulsive word relatedness can long pretend to be an authority on language
actually that shows how old fashioned you are meet my partner few people nowadays would assume you were introducing someone with whom you have a professional relationship in the last fifteen years or so the primary meaning of partner has shifted from denoting a professional to a romantic relationship
although that phrase wasnt talking about heterosexuals so any outrage ensuing is severely misplaced okay so what is this biological tyranny then who is implementing it perhaps so but then most guardian writers dont have political power sufficient to compel people to do what they want either oh i expect theyre a yardstick of altleft thought these days they usually possess all the correct benchmark characteristics thats what hes doing absent of specific calls for compulsion to say something must be done is to urge change not force it its the trial balloon for the compulsion that comes later thats how policy gets made lets ask this what happens if he having the power to do so selects a list of approved words for parents and some people refuse to use them its the difference in presentation between must and ought the conclusion explicitly says otherwise the conclusion references nothing whatsoever about terminology it covers the equality of validity in heterosexual and homosexual and mixedfamily parenting this is not terminology well i would imagine if you had a more convincing basis upon which to find fault with the article something which actually was linked to the specific argument made youd have done so yes legal precedent elsewhere must simply be dismissed much like counterreferencing orwell with an ironic twist is an argument and youre saying i had no basis to find fault here i did i pointed you back to the article in which the answers can be found you did not and your answer here makes no more sense who is preventing you from using different language for varied genderparent roles andrew
the obvious word when mixing up mum and dad is mad cousin and aunt could be a bit more challenging
a few comments suggesting that it is wrong to raise children without a male female partnership and if you think about how rare now it is to hear people say a single mother cant raise a child without a man i suspect they are really objecting to the lack of a motherso i would like to say two things to them all through history sadly mothers have died and fathers have filled the gap in modern times it has also become socially acceptable for fathers to share and in  and rising cases in the uk to do the childcare whilst the mother works in addition  of single parents in the uk are male so a man can quite successfully raise a child as two men we did think hard on whether we thought it was ok to give a child two men as parents we were worried that it would not be as good as having a mother and father we actually decided not to become parents but then i met a foster parent who basically laughed at me saying that and said to me are you joking there are thousands of children in care desperate for a family to love and raise them they have no mother and father and you are worried that two dads might not be enough it is two more than they have nowwhich made me think and we spoke about it and we decided to explore adoption and here we are and frankly the people who feel they have the right to criticise us for loving and raising two children to the best of our ability would be better spent putting their energy into solving the problems of society that are ending up with so many children in care
i am though
and here you have it in one all your confusions and prejudices the words dad mom grandpa etc are still being used and are not being changed by polically correct words the author is at pains to point out that children are coming out with all sorts of ways to grasp these fluid relationships when my husbands biological children oliver and lucy learned to talk they called their birth mother mama and their adoptive mother mommy then there was the question of what to call my husband to make it clear that mama and mommy were the primary parents but that john had a special relationship to them john suggested donor dad but they didnt know what donor meant so they called him donut dad now they call my husband papa and me daddy and the son who is legally johns and my child calls them mama and mommy and when jennifer finney boylan came out as transgender her children felt they could no longer call her daddy but they couldnt go with mommy because that title was already taken by their mother so they came up with maddy so as a result of this the author calls for a fiesta of new terms i think as adults we have to be more productive or at least more relaxed about what the term parent brother sister aunt mean i wonder who is trying to impose politically correct words maybe because you think they are natural
many studies such as
it is easier to stop people using terms than to make them use others ultimately language follows attitude and not the other way round
my wife and i adopted children internationally so that it was obvious to anyone they werent biologically our offspring aside from language there are a lot of rude behaviors that you experience with total strangers going out of their way to do so you mostly end up ignoring peoples attitudes though in some ways it has been instructional for our childrenincidentally in a discussion about genetic testing done in regard to research about genetic diseases i was told that there is a surprising amount of paternal discord found so a lot of not real fathers out there whether they know it or not
your embracing eugenics shows total disregard for the childrens future emotional assessment of their family situation all the available evidence points to otherwise
whooooossshhhhh i hope
yep youve nailed it the problem is that liberlism wants to impose things all the time we must use these words and avoid others we must think this way we must must behave that waythis sounds very authoritarianlanguage censorship is not a good thing
seeing people use mother to mean parent drives me crazy
or pan biological
some people do it because they know that minute they can claim to be offended certain other people will fall in line and do exactly as those who are trying to manipulate them want them to somewhat ironically its actually just another form of bullying the modern day version of crying to win an argument but without the need to even have to summon up fake tears
its on par with men demanding the removal of the phrase manhating or the reference of typically by men in the oed definition of rape it isnt on par with that at all rabid is frequently used to describe all types of fanatics whereas manhating is a very narrow definition
and i always respond with the same thing how dare you speak to me
i should clarify any reliable sources
doubleplusgood
it is obvious where your number  is 
usually heavily shamed people pleaser types seeking to obsequiously ingratiate themselves with women to feel a sense of acceptance and hence self esteem
well i specifically said labels himself that is the creepy part
so feminists campaign and men bitch a bit like irregular verbs
what a bloody mares nest if that is not too sexist a remark say stallions nest if it sounds better what about if the definition had run rabid communist would that be political victimization of communists and why should not his study be prefaced by a summary of his own researches would men be entitled to jib at her study prefaced by a summary of her own researches as being slanted womens voices certainly can be shrill rather more than mens though i am not familiar with the term as a noun as in the example officious tinkering with the english language as r dawkins put it ship me somewhere east of suezwhere the best is like the worstwhere there aint no ten commandmentsand a man can raise a thirst i wonder if i will make out the person in the moon tonight
what i find most amusing about this is that the tabloids contribute more neologisms to the oed than the broadsheet newspapers because the broadsheets are too conservative to risk stretching the boundaries of the lexis in the same kind of waythe fact that the playful and less politically correct tabloids are clearly calling the shots on the future of the english lexis means that the dictionary dice are already loaded against the more politically correct broadsheetsso come on broadsheets start coining your own words in accordance with your own politics and preferably work in the gigglefactor or else the smutty less pc tabloids will steal the show
why are your criteria any more valid my point was just because twitter is a cancer doesnt mean everything posted on there is by default incorrectyou seem to be arguing in favour of some impartial professionalism that you imagine exists in academia i would argue that such is not the case
my mistake it actually lists more than  words so the definitions must run into tens of millions
feminists put a lot of effort into pressurizing menwomen into becoming feminists for example do you support genderequality then you are a feminist so it can be very confusing for the poor guys
hey now feminism is a great way to meet chicks
this is not about the oed
an easily diffused row simply refer to peope from cork in lieu of women their shrill tones tend to grate especially when they rabidly expel the erroneous belief that they are somehow superior ill never really fathom the corkonians psyche
the oed merely this not about the oed
oh i get it now english dictionaries arent to be trusted because they find their origins in the work of a privileged white man who lived in a time when structures of white privilege amp oppression were at their most fearsome that would certainly be more than enough to damn them over at twitter
i actually used to work in the team that checks ation examples i wonder when they now take examples from tweets seriously the examples come from the whole history of a words usage helping to map changes in its meanings including some offensive meanings and words which are all part of the language during most of that history there wasnt an awareness of sexism in language so unsurprisingly many examples are or appear sexist the dictionary is a repository of evidence about usage and it is important for it to include evidence of the existence of sexism
agreed
feminists may scream loudly but theyre in the minority thankfully
perfect guardian clickbait 
i was thinking the same thing the oed has more than  definitions imagine going through them one by one looking for something to be offended by
i disagree with your sister im female a male feminist has actually understood what feminism is about not about women only but equality for all
the case for keeping this in the oed this is not the oed
nice to see this guy tackling the big issues when it comes to malefemale inequality in society reminds me of the rabid shrill and grating reactions some people had to the rossetta scientists shirt when they were landing on the comet
come now are you trying to tell me what i consider rabid feminism how does rabid feminism as an example in the dictionary continue any narrative that women are inferior humans it is clear that there are a lot of rabid feminists these days whether you identify as one or not and they are trying to turn everything into a gender issue if you dont see these people i have to ask whether you are truly aware of what feminism represents as a word these days because the word is being stolen from rational well meaning people and being used by dishonest petty bullies its unfortunate but thats the reality of feminism in  and rabid feminism is currently truer than ever regardless of what you or others may think you suggest just ignoring the issue but i dont see why i should when i see the damage it is doing do you not see it
this complaint was made by a guy from my feminist sisters experience men who label themseves as feminists are usually very creepy
the readerships of the guardian and the daily mail arent mutually exclusive bodies i see this story is attracting much attention from the intersection set the desiccated academics at the oup should be ashamed of themselves
perhaps it would be better to challenge whether these stereotypes are true rather than try and get them bannedalso one of the problems with society is the idea that women cannot be critisized
ha ha ive never heard the phase rabid feminist before but im going to double my efforts to include it in casual conversations going forward
even a stopped clock is right two times a day do tell us on what grounds do you suppose that the time of day has finally aligned itself with this particular stopped clock because it feels right perhaps this would of course be the twitter standard
its very worrying that the matriachy and mysandrists are attempting to rewrite the oed
rabid feminists want to ban the phrase rabid femisist thats fine dont have a problem with it not at all on   scale of severity of problems faced by er personkind this ranks at about a  drop rabid feminist move on to the next outrage im personally amazed that twitter hasnt stormed yet about vehicles of various kinds being referred to as she my dustmen er dustpeople call their truck the old girl which is blatantly asking for trouble if not outright sacking and ranks at least a  by my reckoning
the tanker turned a long time ago now its in danger of going too far
yes lets pretend that we can only care about a single issue and must rank everything by importance and never ever work on anything else until number  is solved
bang on and it all started with that noted postmodernist samuel johnson
oh look another canadian working for gender inclusion liberal mp trying again to change lyrics to o canada to make it more gender neutral i wont stand for o canada until it is corrected to be gender inclusive and remove words addressed at supernatural entities that dont exist
oh no youve used the word patriarchy the mras will now descend on you like a pack of rabid dogs
too much time on his hands phd in bumming around is it american definition of course
i take it youre an expert in their methods since youre way more positive that they shouldnt change rabid positive than i am that they should change it so i guess you can tell me how they deal with the usemention distinction there you go trying to shift the burden of proof you ought to know that the burden of proof rests with the one who is arguing against the statusquo amp in this case that would be you do you have any good reason to distrust their methods amp the resulting entries amp examples do tell us i merely hope that they wont make any rash changes simply to appease the twitterati in the wake of a twitter storm
alright then febrile feminism its even alliterative but dudes there was no twitter storm just a couple of white whale chasers lead by captain ahab to catch moby dick
religion royalty worship has to go the lot is nonsense firstly and rife with patriarchal misogyny
must be dropped or else what
its all so much vagicentricism
unfortunately politicians and the media seem to base their views on what happens on twitter
oh so you are doing something about child nutrition or are you spending your time writing comments on the internet
all words rooted in malepenis must be dropped it is the right way to move forward women contributed to evolution too religious rants amp ritual all male why would any fem go in for that
louise gouёffic looking at the speechmaking species through the lens of language trilogy  breaking the patriarchal code  knowledge ideas and trends manchester ct too many canadiennes then
so you want to retain the right to offend people based on the continued usage of outmoded patterns of thought and the expression thereof rather than encourage the evolution of language to become more balanced and inclusive
many modern men say that they are feminists it seems to me certainly here in very pc berlin im sure theyre sincere
this really is nothing short of pathetic
but these cultural products are everybodys are the not or should it be renamed the oxford dictionaries for men there is nothing wrong with trying to get away from heavily enforced stereotypes about women and men
the postmod litcrit gambit eh theres no such thing as objectivity or anything remotely approaching objectivity so why even try to be objective lets just all be subjective about everything and accept that the views floating around twitter are just as valid as those of professional lexicographers or perhaps even more so because the things floating about on twitter are pure the product of the rich experiences of its diverse membership whereas socalled expertise is nothing more than the product of systems of oppression and thus ought to be distrusted am i getting the hang of it
and a woman gets put in hospital by a man every  seconds in the uk alone your point is
i take it youre an expert in their methods since youre way more positive that they shouldnt change rabid positive than i am that they should change it so i guess you can tell me how they deal with the usemention distinction
i doubt that theyre antifeminist sigh critical of positions held by selfdeclared feminists would be more accurate
what is wrong with them the only objection would be if they were outdated
the latin word homo means any member of the human species not necessarily a male one the latin word for a male human is vir
maybe you should check the definition of definition
bible and porn are two media genres for it will that do for starters
behaving in a drunken manner check foam at the mouth and an aversion to water check refusing help from a man while muttering about the patriarchy check aaargh i know whats wrong with them singular but im not allowed to write it down
twitter storm is a handy term whenever you see it you know the issue will be one which makes absolutely fckall difference to anything
even a stopped clock is right two times a day
well i imagine they need to be able to spell properly which would put you out of the running
first  people in the uk didnt like a jimmy carr joke and complained what kind of life is it to spend your days wandering around looking for things to be offended by absolute pathetic
which is completely insane of course
what would be entirely wrong would be to select examples on the basis of how appropriate they are rather than on whether they reflect common usage that approach would undermine the whole point of a dictionary and the most important thing for the dictionary here is to maintain the integrity of the process the appropriateness of the phrase isnt even a consideration given that there are always multiple usage options to choose between i dont know what the problem is with having appropriateness as one of many considerations it just seems like a kneejerk reaction to being asked to think about the actual social effect of language
i wish it was inevitable but it might not be thats no reason to give up mind and progress has been made much in the same way that weve made some progress against racism since well since as long as i can remember
why the hell should anyone conform to your political stance we live in a plural society that means we are all free to use whatever pronouns we wish and thereby resist the coercive sjw movement
now just replace female pronouns with male pronouns would there be such a big deal about the examples used in orthodox dictionary it seems now the orthodox dictionary will have to try its best being political correct from now on as old stereotypes are still offending people today it will become difficult to have freedom of speech as your every word is now questioned on whether you are showing signs of oppression to a particular religion ideology or race
yet another example of selective distortion with the aim of discrediting an sjw hate object fuck it oxford dictionaries should avoid the kneejerk surrender response and ignore these sjw fanatics we cant let these people with their narrowminded selfrighteous view of whats acceptable determine our cultural products they have no right not to be offended
crying wolf evenually loses complete credibility
prescriptive language policing never works i dont know how totalitarian a feminism you want but it still never works language evolves organically and reflects realities not fever dreams if you actually looked into the etymology of words used for man you will find it is all about the jobs they do and their position in the hierarchy the only one that is about the essential nature of being a man is the old english were women do have a lot of terms ultimately derived from genitalia and beauty but at least that is about something intrinsic to them rather than the hard graft they have to do for others
thanks for that case closed i reckon
watch the footie that is sexist stereotyping and im not joking in my lifetime im a  yearold bloke the great majority of sexist language and stereotyping has come from the females of my peers as a child of the s and s it was always selfevident that you dont view females as inferior however as this latest wave of feminism theres a term that could do with a rebranding andor redefinition continues it seems to me that the women of my generation being on the side that is seen to have the morally higher position simply by virtue of being female have failed to grasp the principles of egalitarianism quite as profoundly as the men of my generation who have had the message rammed down their throats their whole lives its the fate of the victim perhaps to be lacking in selfreflection seeing as nothing is their fault
pc gone rabid
or simple the cleaner does the housework
what other thoughts will be proscribed are feminists really so fragile or indeed so united that describing one of their number as rabid must be banished from the lexicon poor dears
if you think theres no subjectivity in lexicography you know very little about it
got any sources for this patriarchy conspiracy theory
how is rabid feminist sexist when will feminists realise feminists women
or do you think that perhaps they might be applying some judgment yes quite they may well be using their judgement but of course why rely on the judgement of the lexicographers when we have the brainiacs over on twitter to tell us what is correct why have experts at all now that we have the social media next up climate change if the latter then i think you would have to admit that bias can come into play when choosing which examples to use but when it comes to complaints arising on twitter amp the resulting twitterstorms absolutely impartial no bias there not possible youre quite right though its a matter of judgement oed or twitter you judge for yourself
rape doesnt require a penis even in a male perps casethat law needs updating its rather sexist and imprecise
are you implying that the readership of the guardian are rabidly rightwing
yeah and yet its the people mildly suggesting oxford dictionaries might like to look at some of their usage examples who are unreasonable apparently
im not it takes a long time to turn a supertanker
that is rather unfair to presume what a complete stranger knows i havent met you and you certainly do not know me to know if i assume anything it seems from your e that it is you making the most out of your own assumptions to propagate your own right to rage at strangers feminism is a radical movement for people to acknowledge accept and implement the belief that all women are human beings and are entitled to the same equal treatment and protections given to men men also would believe in the human status of women and the need for women to have equality under the law otherwise their offspring could be claimed to be the offspring of animals that therefore would mean that men must be feminists also if they believe in the protections of the law extending to their own daughters and sisters and mothers to assume feminists are female is a ridiculous notion of someone presuming that a belief itself has a relationship with gender identity or nongender identity beyond the crude prejudices of behaviour that is assigned according to concepts of feminine or masculinity
twitter storms that great vehicle of social change
many lesbians did decades ago insisting to be the only true feminists evidently not true but they contributed to that cliche 
but we have the option of simply ignoring the nit twits they are not really very important at all
you could also argue that the dictionary should not use politics in its examples of definitions i will be the first person in the queue to throw mud at overthetop feminists but i have to say here they could just use other examples no matter how accurate of an example i think they used for rabid
i would say thats a load of bollocks but thatd be beings sexist so im going to call it an avalanche of labia instead
thank you thats a great answeras stated im disagreeing with the oeds assessment of the prevailing values but i could be wrong in my region and you can disagree with me i do find it jarring when a neutral word is defined in the pejorative in the dictionary in a way that i associate with middle england in the s even if it is the third or fourth definition even if prefixed by sometimes hope you are not counting on it i am only hoping as i said
but i fear that the author has  of  possible intentions a to indicate that english is in anyway more sexist than other language which i do not believe based on the above argument or b to instigate change in the language the latter wont work language changes naturally to reflect the culture and politics of the time we are slowly often mindnumbingly slowly moving to a less sexist time and language will develop to reflect this deliberately trying to instruct or enforce change will only create resentment finding sexism everywhere you can does not help change peoples opinions and usually has the adverse effect your rule of thumb doesnt and shouldnt always hold if this were true you are encouraging people not based on this caseim exaggeratingbut as a general principle to always elevate their inflammatory opinions merely on the basis that it will gain a reaction if this were done in science for instance that would be highly irresponsible and if were calling linguists scientists then the same applies
it betrays a certain mentality to see a dictionary as a tool for social engineering rather than a reflection of common usage
new and improved vaginory
the thing is that they are not embedded in the language they are discriptive words that peolpe choose to use there is no obligation to e e article the denigration of half of the population has embedded itself in the language in ways you may not even be aware of its not true as i have shown above there are no embedded anti female words in the english language that you have to use but there are plenty that you can use not that i do
mister
the queen as far as is known doesnt seem to mind
really women are treated like second class citizens or worse across much of the world and you write about this
exactly the point of the article
its only a question of degree and she did not have strong opinions she was stubborn a defect often mistaken for strength
yes but now that it has been comandeered again by young people to mean ineffectual pointless or useless that is considered disrespectful to homosexual men who consider that they now own the word
you must be hilarious on a night out
thanks yeah i had a look i have to say im not sure its feminists who invented these terms
does your computer have a motherboard
why does nobody wonder why rabid and feminist were used together why not gentle feminist or thought invoking feminist why is that because it is so difficult to conceptualize some things before you actually witness it in the flesh hope this helps you out
i absolutely agree with you about the gangsta culture usages i do not understand that culture and i do not have any patience with it i did not mean to imply that the oed never includes slang usages it has to if it is to be a complete guide to the language but surely rabid feminist is not a slang usage i am not a scientist or an arts professor but i do share your love of beer i also drink large quantities of gin though not as much as the two ladies in thirkells cheerfulness breaks in if you have not already read it pick up a copy her language is well worth reading
fish dont have a word for anything
does anyone know a word a bit like intersectionality that refers to the implied linkage between all oppressed groups sort of underdogs of the world unite
many languages have pronouns which are multipurpose they also have genderspecific personal pronouns and a gap where neither is appropriate even if there is a word that sort of fits but not quite all im suggesting is a more precise addition to the grammar the actual usage of which would be fought out in everyday language you have demonstrated exactly the kind of kneejerk dismissal i was talking about ive always done it this way and im not going to change language evolves whether we like it or not and theres no harm in shoving it along with neologisms shakespeare did a lot of that
the use of lady rather than woman is commonplace which strikes me as odd i come across this every working day as in john there is a lady to see you or there is a lady on the phone for you whats wrong with woman seeing as man is used as opposed to gentleman mistress headmistress headmaster courtesan when and where is this in common usage rabid dog tart jam better still custard as in there are three types of turd custard mustard and you you big shit sort of works
im sure no manly task or job or job description has ever been altered over time to be made fun of or mean something different definitely this is classic citation needed guardian writing
dont you have anything better to do than write total drivel like this dont you have a little book that sits near your desk called english usage madam is a polite form of address madame is often used to describe a brothel keeper but dont let the omission of an e bother you you can find sexism at the heart of every language so why dont you just eff of and reinvent arabic for example no sexism in arabic im sure
would someone explain how remotecontrol was shorted to remote and not control
i doubt that there are any languages on the planet that dont have derogatory words or phrases towards women and also of course towards men indeed you could compare englishs comparitive lack of gender specific when compared to many many languages as being far less sexist generally but since you insist that there is sexism at the heart of the english language i would say a language is a vehicle of communication and its not necessarily the words that exist so much as how they are used that would define sexism in a society are there less words in arabic that reflect its heart of sexismor shall we just say that languages generally can only reflect societys attitudes often historically
interesting article thanks
person is ok and the best we have but its usage is often ugly
poppycock
fine by me i cant remember the last time i needed to use the word mankind before today but dont confuse the drive for brevity which is the single largest factor in the development of language with any instinctive drive towards sexism
for the same reason that women that act in hollywood want to be referred to as actors rather than actresses they perceive that male actors are viewed more favorably have a higher statusso now they want to have a gender neutral term to obscure the relative differences in the publics perceptions of these people the reality is that men play a more active role on the world stage women relatively live have more power in the home but they find that dissatisfyingthat there is no glory in living off center stage wonen want to play their role at the heart of the family but its a role that offers little opportunity to declare their achievements perhaps this discontent is what freud referenced as penis envy oh boy ive put my foot in it now
whats a hedgewhore
how do some of these comment pieces get by quality control this is nearly as bad as julie bindels drivel about boxing as in that case little or no thought has gone into it the comment by vincent brindle below sums it up nicely
its because the expression rabid feminist was used in her biography by the distinguished feminist writer anne oakley the dictionary compilers possibly noting that the expression has been frequently used by others chose it as one of several examples of how the word rabid collocates in reallife use
top results on urban dictionary neckbeard  n derogatory term for slovenly nerdy people who have no sense of hygiene or grooming often related to hobbies such as card gaming video gaming anime et al as i say ive only seen it online probably mostly on reddit usually along with accusations of lack of sexual success eg those mras are just a bunch of bitter virgin neckbeards dude browhite suburban males usually  years of age hailing from anywhere usa characterized by their love of college football pickup truckssuvs beercut off khaki cargo shorts light pink polo brand shirts with collar popped abercrombie amp fitch hollister gear and trucker hats favorite bands include but are not limited to oar jack johnson dave matthews band avengened sevenfold the fray and often crappy radio rap ie nelly dem franchize boyz dl etc dude bros are incredibly insecure in their manhood which makes them insanely jealous of their girl friends overly macho and laughably homophobic currently there is no cure for being a dude bro again ive only seen this one online im sure its been used by guardian writers
and its a crying shame that more pubs dont make their own beer
whats wrong with madam its only the equivalent of sir and id like to be called sir if i was a man
serpent lizard
you ever see that the term wanker in a dictionary yes
i agree so long as youre using sexist in a nonjudgmental sense there are certain words we are more likely to associate with one or the other gender thats because the sexes are different and a good thing too since this article seems to be focusing on pejoratives one would never call a woman an asshole thats reserved for men like trump women are bitches equivalent terms that describe the unique flavor of the antisocial tendencies in either sex a while ago i was at dinner with a feminist graduate of one of those elite exclusive allwomen new england colleges who referred to our server as a waitron in her effort to deprive this person of their sex she also deprived her as the case was of her humanity and of course she sounded like an idiot
sure but what do you say to the feminists that will use the argument that i outlined above that by meeting the definition of supporting feminism makes you a feminist i suppose its similar to the many denominations of christians that are kicking about the world who gets to decide what type of person qualifies for the label
examining history is very worthwhile we can learn much the hundreds of comments filled with reflexive rage dismissal and insults show this article is very worthwhile indeed a good rule of thumb is that if hundreds of people are screaming abuse and telling you to shut up you should absolutely keep talking i applaud this author
not familiar with the term
just remember that a mistress is halfway between a master and a mattress
bitter you 
and aptly do try again if you mean i was using the term aptly you may well be rightbut in that case i am not sure why you would want me to try again
actress has only been replaced by actor on the guardian it is kind of silly too since if there is one place where gender difference is important its acting
wench is a common word for a young woman in the west midlands it is no more contemptuous than is lass up north
im calling into question the oeds value judgement on what are to me essentially neutral words but which are presented in the dictionary with examples that suggest that they have a specific slant in everyday use with all due respect to you the dictionary does not limit itself to the neutral meanings words have for you the dictionary contains all the meanings attached to a word in the case of the oed a word has to be used with a given meaning in least three separate instances before it is included that is how it was when i was learning about dictionaries words take on value judgments as soon as they are used in a sentence by anyone because they do express the speakers or writers values it cannot be avoided even a simple good morning takes on different meanings according to the speakers tone the oed simply reports the prevailing values when selecting a ation to show how the word is used like you i find many usages jarring but not when i see them in a dictionary a dictionary records and only rarely prescribes as when it indicates a word is obsolete or that a usage is ignorant which suggest you should avoid the word and the usage the oed is a very special kind of dictionary and it should not be equated with any other however good those others might be it is not the dictionary of first resort i use chambers for that and one or more of the other six on my reference shelves i also have dictionaries of slang and thesauruses i also have the complete oed i use it for words missing from the one volume works and also to check on historical usages it is also interesting to see older meanings return im hoping that things will improve on what they are today i hope you are not counting on it especially in the realm of language as a tool of real and honest communication
whenever anyone normally a bloke says to me something like excuse me madam i reply yes rent boy i then explain why and say they can call me miss or ms but dont call me madam as i dont run a brothel normally people think about it and understand why ive corrected them men get mr and thats it irrespective of marital status or sir a bit of authority there the arguments ive had about this one and why a single word for women eg ms is far better saves all the explaining that yes at  im still technically single and prefer women and for fcks sake stop addressing me as mrs or madam
but most of these words originated from a time in which the world was much more sexist than it is now so of course there are sexist connotations just as there will be in every language as the world moves on language will change with it but it will take time get on with it and dont write ridiculous articles out of nothing
it it give me an example
i dont agree jamesday the op said  it should be a problem for all of us that mysogyny is still so endemic miniminds comments sounds a fair point to make against that statement
most of the world has rabies its just the british who are rabid 
perhaps the guardian could go the whole hog and get itself appointed guardian of the english language which is clearly a reactionary mess the results couldnt fail to be doubleplusgood
im so glad to learn that people like jessica valenti and julie bindel are figments of my imagination here id thought that those individuals and their ilk had advocated for things like putting men in camps and taking them out like library books or for serious reductions of the male population etc no rabid feminists indeed the guardians own julie bindel interviewed on radfemcollective
im led to believe that the oed gave about eight examples of the uses of rabid through the years the attachment to feminist was just one of them
yay you lost it i win ps a truism is something so obvious it is redundant to express it you are very good at them the etymology of words is completely based on how they were used throughout history no really medieval sailors who feared calling off the edge of the world were they flatist
good thing there are no words related to men that have any negative meanings whatsoever eyes rolling so much they fall out and roll across the room
when the original sentence was written women werent allowed to be in possession of a good fortune their nearest male relative would be looking after it for them
yeah because thatcher was as bad as hitler eh no just a woman with strong opinions made her such a hateful person to society its not like with like mate
have another titter
watching too much tv will give you only a limited experience with words and their multiple uses
cool humans is even shorter again so lets use that
who refers to a salty old sea dog anymore today if a man is described as a dog it suggests sexual incontinence so definitely not a positive thing
madam is used to address judges mps presidents now the sextrade is openly discussed people dont seem to be sonudgenudgeabout the word the correct term is brothelkeeper
for heavens sake man its society which has kept women down not whether a woman is called an actor or an actress your argument throughout this thread is that language is at fault changing words isnt the issue its changing minds changing words is only pandering to the pc gallery most languages are hugely genderised but that doesnt make their societies more sexist i repeat its not language its minds and attitudes
ill ask again what sort of abuse mental or sexual sexual is the type that leaves the most damage no doubt youll say it doesnt no im not googling it for obvious reasons i grew up catholic what those priests got away with and oh look religion also tries to tell how a woman should behave and how theyre responsible for the worlds ills men fuck up this planet trump isis kim jong thousands of years of the male ego trying to compete to win
too right you are vincent thank you
and can you explain when it was a normal descriptor for a man ah theres wanker jones vs ah theres madam jones its an insult but has always been rather than losing its original meaning and becoming an insult because it is associated with men ie madams transference to mean brothel manager i do believe i understood that point from reading the article maybe just maybe you and others missed the point of my comment
david if you are a linguist you should be ashamed of yourself for such an unscientific and superficial analysis but of course how less attractive and guardianlike to simply be well informed
the authors argument is a fallacyor even a phallasy
mistress madam and spinster are still very much used
growing up in the south west in the s we used the term maid for pretty much any woman who wasnt the same age as your gran i remember my younger brother saying wench though usually to his girlfriends who mostly referred to him as a digby if you get that reference then youre proper devon blokes were bays african americans have now culturally appropriated this so i have to fall back on my luvver which gets some looks these days
what is the high status male equivalent of a wench or a tart or a hussy only one of the eight words has a higher status male equivalent governess to governor a knave is an untrustworthy man but used to mean boy but a fair maiden would always be trusted im certain you can think of other examples
lords lord it over others pejoratively but ladies never lady it
so you recognise that the phenomenon exists but still maintain that the writer is seeing something that isnt there that makes sense sure its fairly pointless but whats the big deal it actually seems like you feel that some point is being made and you dont like that point otherwise it would go in the mildly interesting pile and thatd be that
my guess is whoever started this all just typed rabid into a search engine and picked the first few suggestions
the words spinster and wife referred to the roles within a family unit an unmarried woman would commonly live with her sister and sisters husband and take the lowly job of spinning while the wife did the weaving in exchange for a position in the family a spinster had to ingratiate herself the term spinster suggests failure in the task of bagging a husband it has connotations of being left on the shelf perhaps the implication being that the spinster was too unattractive the bachelor by contrast is often seen as a man enjoying his freedom before settling down there is more of a sense that he has chosen this status for the time being and is biding
brilliant article showing once more the power of culture to influence words and then of repeated word use to reinforce the bias of a culture round and round we goes where it stops is more unconscious fear and hatred of the feminine and of feminine power i should know im a gay male whos endured merely the secondary fallout of puritan societys hatred for the feminine what the heck am i talking about you might ask that is if you have a shred of a mind not brainwashed by your own culture unconsciously gay males are loathed because a they are acting like they are too feminine and b they are willingly giving up their superior male privilege to act all girly admittedly a and b are completely nuts especially since behaviorally and attitudinally speaking since gay males come in every flavor of the er rainbow but because they are gay again whichever of many flavors they are they have forsaken the superior land of masculinity and as traitors to the male clan embraced the repulsive feminine unforgivable im guessing since i have never been a woman that it may be slightly easier to pass as straight if one is a gay male compared to being condemned to obviously be a feared or hated ewe woman hope a few readers of this can think about it puritan protestantism and many catholics too blame women for having been a the evil or stupid temptress back in the garden o eden and therefore b to blame for all the worlds woes hence headscarves common law and all the other puritan includes that third womanhating religion too islam devices to everremind women that they are tolerated for bringing us our sons but must be directed and controlled the dear little women this entire system is the ocean which western mankind swims in fish dont have a word for water most of us males similarly have no word for the vast unconscious fear or fury with which our inner brainwashed egos hold women and those traitorous gay men so of course our language drips with reinforcements of these attitudes ive only seen all this clearly because a my mothers was an original femininst and b being gay sort of keeps you out of the inherited male privilege club im grateful for both gifts
its such a relief that men dont have to suffer through shifts in the meaning of words bums trampsthese used to be words we could all use now he have to say homeless which does nothing but obscure what we are talking about the reality is that these people should be called mental casualties if we could call them what they are maybe we could get a consensus for getting them some constructive help but those on the left seize control of the language and we are now obliged to reference these people as the homeless does the left control the language out of compassion for our mental casualties i dont think they do the lefts agenda is more in support of a race agenda of providing subsidized housing to blacks living in poverty because of misguided poverty programs since the s and the unwillingness of blacks today to reform their society and reject the antipoverty subsidies that are clearly doing absolutely nothing to pull them out of poverty
i think it would be more enlightening if you tell us about your uncle ali whom you have so fondly described elsewhere and his contributions to human rights in general and womens rights in particular being part of the elite in the post shah iran tell us about your struggles to be accepted by the british elite your early voice against diversity your writing for bp and the disillusionment that came that would be relevant a piece like the above just comes across as bitter and offensive against the culture that was accepting enough to you and your family you can do better
the minions have a good language with the added bonus that it is both comprehensible gibberish and funny at the same timenoka
if its all crap like this i will be swerving his byline from now on
over thirty years ago when selling a house i told the estate agent that i did not want the main bedroom called the master bedroom i said that if they put this on the details we would find another estate agent he looked surprised i asked would you put the mistress bedroomi think he got the messagebut so many television presenters still use this term implying that the man of the house is the most important person even when a woman is the buyer
inspection chamber is the correct term these days
theres nothing particularly thankful about language being gender neutralyes there is for words where gender isnt relevant its only been used to keep women down weve been through the governor of state vs governess of children example already or a princess to be called a princewe shouldnt need those terms in modern society anyway or to abolish the words he and she if you take the argument to its logical conclusionexcept that isnt the argument the argument is that in situations where gender is irrelevant why have gendered words there will of course be billions of situations where gender is relevant and we will of course continue to use gendered words there women are quite capable of looking after themselves without all this pc nonsense and its thoroughly demeaning to tell them they have to adopt the male form to get anyway how sexist is thata shake of the head and a casual dismissal of tens of thousands of years of oppression reflected deeply in our language sigh its a long road i do pity the women who have to put up with dismissive denying attitudes like yours
im hot on this because of the battle im having with gangsta culture in schools see above this sometimes makes me feel like im borderline racist which is pretty uncomfortable but i dont see why anyone should accept a system where women are demeaned some of the examples of sexism argued in the discussion i accept and some i dont i think reading robin lakoffs seminal language and a womans place at college years ago made me think about how this language slippage happens i guess i now find myself fighting cultural changes that demean others be careful what you read btw im a beerswilling football fan and scientist not an arts professor also the oed does cite slang meaning which is what were discussing
yankee in japanese refers to a homegrown hoodlum or thug and has nothing to do with americans
same as grumpy old and man i suppose
it doesnt take much thought at all to understand why a governor steams from the male
ridiculous equivocation equal in political power social worth economic opportunity is what is meant as you know not identical anyway since youre such a fan of inequality how would you feel about men becoming subordinate to women for a bit wouldnt want to be grey drones now would we
can we put you down as frothing then
because its a truismyoure claiming that a patriarchy a society run exclusively by and for men isnt sexist seriously thats what youre claiming utter nonsense my guess is you are not deeply into etymology which is what is being discussed here rather than the history of civilizationyoure talking complete nonsense have realised it and are trying to backpedal the etymology of words is completely based on how they were used throughout history seems like you should know that mr expert that the english language is littered with sexist terms is entirely due to the sexist nature of society throughout history that is what is being discussed mr expert
with cameron its not the word so much but the derisory way in which he used it
yes
i think the problem isnt the english words against certain types of women but the fact that almost all the negative words about mens morals have become archaic lecher profligate reprobate etc shakespeare had a lot of negative words about debauched men but modern english has only held onto negative terms about women
what are you chatting about the dictionary is a reflection of the attitudes held in the population toward women of the ages if this article is a little hard for you to follow then perhaps you should try an easier one like the sundaily mail etc
lol try french or spanish and see how sexism is really injected into an entire population
dogs can be feminists too 
the process of pejoration may take place below the level of consciousness but in historical perspective the direction of travel is obvious this is just pure brilliance i think id like to have this on my headstone better still i might just write on the wall in my office toilet then write the name of a less popular colleague underneath
how do they decide the gender of the various nouns is it like in construction where the receiving parts like an electrical receptacle are referenced as the female part and the plug is the male part im sure that terminology was developed by women and not by a bunch of guys looking to add a bit of amusement to their day so are boats feminine because the receive things and perhaps bullets are masculine i want to understandreally
the situation this article exposes is so sad we should all be on our guards against this kind of thing to ensure neutral words of today used to describe women dont suffer the same fate with regards the words already sullied i tend to think we should take every opportunity to use them and all other negative words of a similar vein to describe men how have acted with the same characteristics as they now describe that way we will gradually equalise and probably reduce the emotional impact that they have
whats next a column from bill clinton on respecting women subordinates in the workplace an iranian lecturing the english on sexist antiwomen bias that beats all
no love for nannicock 
master has more than one definition look it up
whats scraping the barrel in french
you speak as though the dictionary is trivial when in fact language is fundamental to how we communicate make sense of experience and understand the world the dictionary is one of the most important books we have
what about the antimale bias of the first dictionary leaving out the word sausage
it makes one of the donalds rants seem like common sense by comparison
thats because there is never any end for those who like to claim to be offended
what do you think of when i say the word rabid dog what else not a mention
i remember doing that i was in primary school at the time
the latin expression for lefthanded is sinister coincidence i wonder 
i thought it was the other way depths to be plumbed
oops i recommended accidentally i think the people who brushed it off are the same people failing to recognise the importance of these peculiarities in language
when men are described as dogs it may be sexual incontinence but there are other phrases such as be more dog as in the advert which suggest positive connotations when i was at university back in the day buoyed up by the aforementioned lecture on unequal lexical pairings the women made a point of rebranding the word slag and applying it to men who were sexually incontinent we started with male slag but even that connoted that a slag was generally a girl and so we just started using slag to mean either gender dont know if that one stuck perhaps we shouldnt have been calling anyone a slag anyway but one interesting point is to try and identify the female equivalent of stud ie a man who has made lots of sexual conquests and is to be admired for it off you go folks
the cultural marxism point was specific and well targeted there is no science behind this analysis only the option that some how our language is deficient a negative reflection of ourselves and something to be ashamed of bullocks to that
eight words that can also be found in any other language does the writer only speak english
yes but all those usages are now unisex a female prison boss or school bigwig is still a governor the writer meant governor as the male equivalent of governess which i took to mean boss
anyone else had just about had a gutful of this stuff
wait a minute this article is about a previous article what if an article is written about this article we could be entering a new realm a peak article loop ever onwards upwards and less relevant
spinster has the exclusively negative meaning old maid in american parlance although the word is rather archaic these days it is therefore surprising to me that spinster is used on official british civil marriage registries as the female version of bachelor regardless of the brides age and without any negative context or has this changed
i wonder how people would react if we began to refer to gangsters as japs oh boy
the french language is worse the nastiest words are feminine catastrophe maladie douleur détérioration décadence peine souffrance tristesse torture ordalie bête dégradation putain merde urine la pisse chiottes toilettes gale dégénérescence rage punition détérioration 
you asked for an example i gave you one you dont think boy to yob represents much of a slide really i think youve just talked yourself down off the moral high ground but i take my hat off to the hutzpah involved in your claim that youd already considered and rejected this one
not true i cite lady catherine de bourgh what is true is that until very recently a husband remained entirely liable for debts run up by his wife there were many cases of extravagant wives who ran up huge bills only for the husband to be liable there was a famous case of a wifes second husband being liable for the tax on income from the wifes estate inherited from her first husband and on which she refused to pay the tax
its a polite latinised way im sure you know of saying cut his bollocks off or castrate that operation has a profound lifealtering physical effect whether on cattle horses or male humans and alters behavior as wellin your example turned into metaphor so whats the feminine equivalent of being castrated
there are heights yet to be scaled believe me
the article is bordering on the incoherent linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men  nope not even a little bit also the words chosen are carefully cherrypicked
so now were going through the dictionary to find means of taking offense the dictionary
where does it say anything about men using these words the article clearly talks about society or do you think society is only comprised of men
being a frequent dictionary user i had previously noted how certain actions were mainly ascribed to males and others mainly to females and accepted it as due to most common usage i was about to open some dictionaries to find some examples and then saw you had already done it excellently why are these pieces published could the author of the piece and the editors spend a few minutes checking facts the internet was supposed to give us all voice but instead has delivered fauxiamshockedandoffended scolding amateurism and gee whizzery
the guardian reports considerable hostile leftwing reaction to cameron saying a bunch of migrants at todays pmqs it appears the bunch is pejorative and not used in polite circles but it is fine for owen jones to write in the guardian a bunch of tories with sufficient determination it is possible to take offence at more or less anything
how dare someone write something from the perspective of women nobody is saying that however there is an entire section of the guardian that is dedicated to women although a better description of the section would be feminism as i see few articles by women who do not describe themselves as feminists is there such a thing as a womens perspective or a mans perspective in any case do people of the same gender all share the same perspective i think not didnt read anything apart from the headline or did read it and failed to understand it that is rather patronising to both the men and women who have raised some valid objections to the premise of the article that english is an inherently sexist language based on a handful of examples some if not all of which are open to discussion as many commenters have pointed out my ideas are always better than anyone elses especially when the anyone else actually seems to know what they are writing about noone is saying that either but quite a few people men and women have pointed to a number of words that are specifically derogatory about men but perhaps you know all of the commenters minds better than they do
ok ewan you seem to want ownership so its yours its fucked up now anyway
peak guardian this requires crampons and an oxygen mask
which is why we actually say monsieur
its possible to comment on how language use reflects attitudes without advocating censorship they arent accepting our argumentsso well make them do it so much of the outrage is contrived too cameron is getting a wave of outragewell not many places except here i suppose or labours incompetent pr machinefor referring to a bunch of migrants suddenly bunch as slang for a group of people is supposed to be a hideous offense although i dont suppose a bunch of bullingdon boys would be objected to by this fine journal thats why garbage like this article needs to be ridiculed good and hard to nip that tendency in the bud
the english speaking world as a consequence of certain linguistics not the entire language itself
not sure you know what equality means
i dont see anything wrong with the article what i do see is a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon of internetbullying its author
great idea lets start burning books with these words in too its already started in the us with the nword and huck finn why not do the same with every book with the word wench in it hurray the nazis are here again i would be very interested to know whos doctoral thesis or academic work this theory of offensive language is based on does it really cause so much harm
i enjoyed this article its well written and researched  erno particularly but by no means limited to this linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men  this is not true has never been true and is likely impossible to determine poorlyresearched and cherrypicks its examples
suzie dent takes a bit of annual leave and look what bloody happens
oh dearie with english being the second of three foreign language learned in school i was waiting for  naughty words that a lady or anyone else for that matter should never use and now i have wasted precious time of reading a shitty article written in even shittier style f
the french address a male waiter as garcon unfortunately that word means boya term that would be offensive to any male over the age of  but of course these are the french and it is their birthright to be arrogant and insulting
yup articles are not natural ie based on the gender of the noun in german you have to learn them by rotea german noun with all three articles das die der deifi hol dass dich der teufel hole may the devil get you
make that eight you forgot fascist
np just as long as you are sure its not tlcr p
i suggest we should start referring to a lady as gentleman queen as king princess as prince
you know what i think he david really believes that stuff i really do but you might be right
you dont need a new dictionary the online one you said you were searching is quite clearly updating just fine you problem was that your expectations were out of date so its those you need to renew i would suggest doing so continuously but you seem not to have done it at all for about half a century
when you said rabid i thought dog not sure where you were headed there
if we are talking words it would be implying an insult
women treated badly throughout history kept in their place men need words to use to help treat women badly and keep them in their place maintain male dominance they choose to adapt already existing words this seems a sensible strategy if that is your conscious or otherwise aim plus institutional changes in the case of governess for example lead to changes in what a word means that sort of change had much less to do with sexism acting upon the language being more a case of language adjusting to facts on the ground i suppose if you have a maledominated society then there may be more words about women which change to less positive and empowered meanings id like to read some more recent examples to see if the trend has continued to see if the stated imbalance between the sexes for this kind of thing has continued proportionally
horse my present fave fish name is the alewife 
no it doesnt where does he say the dictionary meanings of the words he mentions need to be changed
i enjoyed this article its well written and researched so its amusing but by no means unexpected that there are now  pages of comments from men saying but this applies to words about men too translation how dare someone write something from the perspective of women everything must be written from the male viewpoint otherwise its unfair this article is silly crap etc translatation didnt read anything apart from the headline or did read it and failed to understand it this is wrong my theory is translation my ideas are always better than anyone elses especially when the anyone else actually seems to know what they are writing about
thats not how an aspiring social engineer would see it
do you think all of those male examples are positive activities
lady is one of the strangest words in the language it has a strong duality about it you can offer high praise and say she is a real lady or a waiter can say alright lady whats it going to be and you kinda sense that the waiter does not hold her in high regard
where im from in dudley wench means unmarried woman just like using miss or mademoiselle or fräulein
this is such nonsense we must stop redacting language each new word helps to further define ourselves and the world each deleted or controversial word detracts from our understanding before long we will have a dictionary with only  words and start to actually believe that we can define the whole world in those seven words sexist racist victim abuser misogynyst bigot terrorist
the term bastard is still using the idea of socially unacceptable female behaviour to insult a male at its heart it is not an attempt to directly criticise the man himself but rather to get to him by inferring an insult to his mother
well i dont know about everyone else reading this but it came as a hell of shock to me i hadnt realised that this country having been male dominated for many centuries has lead to a male dominated language i mean how the hell could that happen a quite amazing coincidence isnt it i am so glad one bright spark has finally spotted this well done that man man oh yes this article is by a man the entire female population of this country must be fuming that not one of them ever figured this out before oh well women eh 
every other comment seems to berate the guardian or guardian readers if you start a post with bloody grauniad readers whats the point why not start a website for whingeing right wingers and clear off just a thought
yes elmer fudd
rabid feminists were complaining about rabid feminists on social media days ago
or dickhead try that with the equivalent female part and see how accepted it would be
thanks david i will make sure not to use these words again
i am sure that karen and i would have a great night out
woman is u lady is nonu
but what of the oppressoroppressed narrative
i have this week cancelled my guardian sub and its deranged rubbish like this that mostly explains why
i dont want any titles why as a woman should i have to choose from a range of titles what has my marital status got to do with buying clothes from a website or booking a flighti dont have a title on my bank cards or my passporti have told many online companies that unless they give me the option of not choosing a title i will shop elsewhere
next weeks article outrage over the everyday bias against left handed people actually that might be more of a worthy cause we are discriminated against in using everyday tools and in language hell even the word ambidextrous is discriminatoryand if you agree with me please do not tell me that i am right you will just be showing your true ignorant bigoted colours
fine then that would be a legitimate objection to the article unlike your previous post which wasnt it would be all the more legitimate if you could find some cases of words where there was a male and female version and only the male version had become pejorative i strongly suspect there are some examples of that though cant instantly come up with one im not necessarily supporting the article i just find many of the points being made against it to be fallacious or irrelevant
in the us there are  state governors plus governors of territories and commonwealths
i think she likes to be called maam on presentation to the queen the correct formal address is your majesty and subsequently maamfrom wwwroyalgovuk website
away and patronise somebody else your own gender
i would not know the answer but to pursue the theme when i read the word pop i thought of weasels
the dods bollocks 
outsiders barbarians subhumans
its not just english but the guardian is an english language media so anyway i translated all of these words into french and the result is eerily or not so eerily the same as a french speaker i remember having been startled to find out that the word garce equivalent of wench was once a very positive female of gars a guy
quite how david squares being motivated to write whats the oed example sentence for clickbait
well ive never heard a woman use that expression only ever heard it used by a man
believe me i know of women who think just as badly of promiscuous unmarried and celibate women as men do if not more so the false premise which underlies this article one which a grauniad reader might struggle to countenance is that women use these words or concepts just as much as men
tldr
its not bad enough that the guardian columnists assault readers with halfbaked badlyreasoned and poorlywritten drivel now this one has to assault the english language and in the process make so many misstatements on definitions and worldhistory that its hard to know where to start
haha sure youre not whatever helps you sleep at night
if you dont find mein kampf safe or comfortable then i suggest that you simply dont read it
but julie bindel has written the gran about extreme feminism so doesnt the term rabid sometimes fit feminism a great social movement is in danger of becoming toxic and repressive moral superiority and call out culture has trumped political activism httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreenovfeminismrosettascientistshirtdapperlaughsjulienblancinequality
the issue is with the example sentences not the definitions
given the nonsense some of them come out with  characters does indeed seem at length
quite right rabid feminist is redundant
yeah except thats bollocks isnt it people generally assume feminists are female as everyone knows including you
could give you plenty of examples which would be known to guardian readers but the comment would be moderated before you could blink
its not the oed its oxford dictionaries which is something else entirely
and then what to do with the entries for words that are themselves sexist constitute racial slurs etc must they go too oh heck perhaps its time to handle this the way american universities would and slap a big fat trigger warning on it
no we are not
well theres a phd candidate who doesnt know what a dictionary is
rabid foxy feminist
i dont think thats likely because hed be too scared to say anything lest he offend
personally i am very uncomfortable with rabid feminist per se but any guardian reader will know exactly the type of feminist that they are referring to as for shrill and nagging there are legitimate feminine connotations and of course psyche was female
yes its just bloody disgraceful that they even went ahead and removed the word gullible just to satisfy these tree hugging muesli munching leftie pillocks
one only has to stop being shrill nagging or grating to avoid these descriptors
yes that was the point i was getting at the dictionary is holding up a mirror to society language im not suggesting it needs to change in either case as an aside google ngram is an interesting tool for things like this httpsbooksgooglecomngramsgraphcontentfemalerapistcmalerapistampyear_startampyear_endampcorpusampsmoothingampshareampdirect_urltbcfemalerapistbccbtbcmalerapistbcc
cue silly little giggle from labour mp
if you want to be offended its best to choose the right dictionary if you choose the wrong one you might go away with the impression that the lexicographers aim for balance in choosing their examples that would never do if you want to whip up some synthetic outrage these come from oxford dictionaries online rabid in the process he has been hailed as a prescient genius and dismissed as a rabid extremist but almost always recognised as a novelist of great power and originality has he indeed nurse verb later when pip falls sick joe nurses him back to health and pays off all of his debts joe joe gargery nursing shrill adjective when he thought something ironic he would let out a highpitched shrill laugh that sounded like a hyena showing his feminine side no doubt psyche what did charles darwin have to say about crying because he certainly gave some attention to the emotional makeup of the human psyche and so on
hilarious do calm down dear
everything is sexist these days
what about rabid misandrists anyway how do these intolerant morons get into positions of authority
i completely agree this is a very valid point the devil is in the detail only  years ago a female friend in her early ies who is from a wealthy background and was then a rabid republican supporter british living in ca and putting republican stickers on her car etc said to me feminist really dont say you are a feminist only lesbians are feminists so there something to consider and yes preconceived ideas feed off from the smallest details in our lives such as how we form examples in dictionaries she also used to say my sister is a banker and she will remain old spinster i dont work because i want to have family with lots of children it provided a truly valuable glimpse into the western society for me as i come from ex commie country where feminism used to be a given ironically she was fun to be with and i miss her as a friend but that lesbian remark was truly shocking if this is how half of the population think we are in a deep trouble
rabid is the right description although deranged works equally well
and how come swiveleyed only seems to apply to those not just on the right but the far right how come far in this context only applies in one direction i can remember benn seniors spitting imageoffencetaking is quite tiring and complicated thankfully as a male im not really up to it
errrrrrrrrrrr i didnt say any of that stuff you seem to think i said i am portraying my lack of surprise that feminists are trying to change usages of words or at least the perception of the usage of words after all they are notoriously rabid when it comes to pushing their beliefs on people and institutions
i suspect their sin came about through not thinking about it rather than any deeply held sexist beliefs
lol interesting how this article has brought out so many rabid and avid tabloid reading citizens the why ill leave to others
so what do we do if we meet a female egalitarian with hydrophobia i have no way of describing them now
a certain amount of adjustment is probably possible especially when it comes to examples but if the language we speak is still dogged by sexism surely a dictionary should reflect this maybe a new indicator alongiside the likes of pej vulg etc could indicate that certain usages are considered sexist a dictionary should be a record of language as it is not as we would like it to be
erm well youre wrong on both accounts all murderers certainly cannot be assumed to be male many women are convicted of murder too were you unaware of this men may be more likely to be murderers women are more likely to have high pitched voices do you not understand the comparison why is one sexist and dumb and the others not
only on the pages of the guardian could you hear those two described as such the same guardian that had a how red is ed competition when milliband became leader only in the uk would some like ed milliand be considered a red and only in the guardian would lp and jv be described as rabid by the btl chatterati
i think you are too late this is going to happen it will no longer be permissible to apply the word rabid to feminism therefore literally by definition no one can be too extreme in their feminist views if you want to understand mainstream feminist thought take any discussion on any subject and apply these lines from orwell you are a slow learner winston how can i help it how can i help but see what is in front of my eyes two and two are four sometimes winston sometimes they are five sometimes they are three sometimes they are all of them at once you must try harder it is not easy to become sane
the oed exists to record the language as its used and not merely to express what the rabid ideologues see what i did there think ought to be the proper usages which is why youll heartily applaud their move to change the example based on the fact that they have just recognised that rabid feminist is not nearly as common as rapid fan and other collocations in their corpus cambridge dictionaries online for example was there already with even the most rabid football fan  and rabid antisemites
wow that was poorly expressed typically can be reasonably defined as something that is more than  likely
your supporting arguments are not terrribly worthy of much consideration so i felt only the need to refute your conclusion
surely the point is that the oed may not have kept up with changing usages in these cases do we still assume all doctors are male and all nurses are female or has that changed a bit since those definitions were codified
but is your offencometer sensitive enough you might miss some
who wrote them initially do you think dictionaries should remain static unchanged rigid enshrined are you recommending we never rewrite dictionaries to reflect modern life and modern usage
care to explain how the stereotype is sexist
rabid feminists demand that the dictionary changes in order to fit their world view this should be the description under rabid
if only there were a word to describe how strongly you felt about feminism
this is yet another story that gives feminism a bad name what like seaview or dunroamin
nope you are allowed to use whatever sort of language you want to equally other people are entitled to respond to your language however they see fit you can say motherfucker in a job interview if you want to but noone has to give you the job the oed can include examples like these if they want to if they do some people will probably advocate a boycott other people may or may not listen or care this is how freedom of speech works
to an almost statistical certainty all murderers can be assumed to be male however to suggest that shrill sounds typically eminate from the throat of a woman or that anything nagging is more than likely to be a wife is plainly sexist and dumb
so in the choices made perhaps they can choose examples that dont reinforce negative stereotypes presumably in order to make the dictionary a safe space great now the dictionary can be just as pointless as a student union
and in another article they are trying to abolish he and she equality fanatics and feminists arent so much rabid as a scourge on humanity
you carry on attacking those windmills meanwhile in the realitybased world people understand that language influences how we think and serves to reinforce stereotypes some people even get that sexism and all the allotropes of prejudice is pervasive and not limited to redfaced old buffers chuntering about a womans place but exists and selfreinforces as a constant background hum of relatively minor shit like this and its not like the entries are hard to change for heavens sake
not rapid just vapid
read klemperers lti for some insight into the required mindset to impose your ideology on a living language end of end of what end of reason end of your abiity to defend an assertion everyone imposes ideology on living languages thats what makes it living as opposed to ossified and fixed and dead we impose ideology on it every time we use it
well yes but they are ordering you not to mention it
there are degrees of rabidity
twitter is a mob of mindless drones the oed should get itself a spine its a lost cause in any case its definition of atheist for instance has been changed such that it mixes up a lack of belief with a positive belief in no god in a single line definition thats not a fail thats someone with an agenda making a bad definition and right in the heart of the oed
nope its not its just removing a sexist stereotype
sorry typos english language _users_perhaps the document _is_ flawed
considering the deluge of outcontrollable outrage from antifeminists under any article that contains the word feminist dont you feel just the teeniest weensiest bit hypocritical
when they say rabid i think they mean ones like these but not all feminists httpsmyoutubecomwatchvsrquhhhyo httpsmyoutubecomwatchvqodygtktuym
i dont think it has any affect on feminisms name whatsoever
yes it would be a good idea to remove them you say its a good idea to which i can respond simply by saying its not wow look how easy it is to comment without bothering to provide any supporting arguments kudos on your discovery its like applying twitter rules btl
our point is that rabid isnt necessarily a negative adjective and that example sentence neednt be negative either our example sentences come from realworld use and arent definitions if the oxford dictionary doesnt think rabid is negative than i dont trust it to give the most inusagecorrect connotation on words and will use another publisher
i just had the misfortune of catching doris karloff on the wireless giving us her two pennorth on something or other definitely shrill
mckinnon dworkin bindel theyre all rabid valentis positions on microaggressions noplatforming safe spaces and jackie are rabid
i didnt say it should be a safe space just be aware of over selecting sexist usages of language in the same way you would be aware of racist and antisemitic examples
nonsense of course they do do you think they collect every example of word usage in phrases and then choose only the most common ones as part of a completely statistical process or do you think that perhaps they might be applying some judgment if the latter then i think you would have to admit that bias can come into play when choosing which examples to use also i suspect the majority of those making these decisions are men however slightly more than half of the english language uses are women do you think that perhaps women might choose different examples from men if women are underrepresented in this documentation of how english is used then perhaps the document if flawed
thats just a fact if you assume typically would be reasonably defined as something like more than  likely
i have a nagging headache ill let you know when its gender becomes clear
uh but in this instance we are talking about examples of how a word is used and not the historical uses of a word therefore the oed needs to be more careful to avoid sexism and racism in its examples its not difficult to do particularly for those who work with words
im not sure how the oed incorporates the usemention distinction into their usage examples but yeah that could become an issue
reaches for his copy of rogets thesaurus specialleftieputdownedition
i think you are confusing removing a few negative stereotypes with censorship thats quite a leap there
in   yearolds stormed the beaches of nazi occupied france so that  years later their  yearold descendants could cry into their bovril over hurty words and sore fefes
strictly alternating uses could fix the problem or using they which is a perfectly acceptable singular pronoun when the gender is unknown and has been for hundreds of years
id never say that laurie penny was rabid on the contrary she reminds me of minnie mouse on helium
how is nagging a sexist word
blimey if you think those two are rabid you need to get out more really
this is yet another story that gives feminism a bad name rabid feminists put your names below
what we are experiencing is really no more or less than soviet style censorship who will be brave enough to put an end to it
i agree but the rabid bit and the twitter backtracking proved and confirmed that the dictionary folks did get something wrong
no it hasnt proved that at all
some wives nag yknow it does happen
yes it would be a good idea to remove them
so now there is no such thing as a shrill rabid feminist
no just an interest in feminism
i think morons habitually demanding the right to censor stuff they dont like is the real issue its not even about what they like or dont like they just spot something that they think they could get censored with enough pressure then relish their ability to force something to change ive seen the term crybully used recently on the internet and it seems appropriate they want to claim to be the victim while simultaneously forcing others to do what they want
of course its feminists trying to rewrite the dictionarys i am not surprised in the least
how dare you i insist you have your comment changed at once
the example sentence containing the phrase rabid feminist has to be reviewed after offending rabid feminists now that is a kind of twisted poetry
if youve got a better phrase to describe jessica valenti and laurie penny id love to hear it
the examples arent there to illustrate what the most likely use of a word is but to give a recognisable example of how it could be used also on your logic most people who have shrill highpitched and piercing voices are women and women do most of the housework so whats wrong with those examples exactly
ironically after this particular twitter storm rabid feminist is going to show up as more common a phrase thus supporting the case for keeping this in the oed
could have been worse httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhuvluhuow
well statistically men do a very great deal more murdering than women
hmmmhttpwwwtheguardiancomuknewsnovgaylenewlandsentencedeightyearsprisondupingfriendhavingsex
im so offended by the notion of rabid feminism that i am going to trawl through the entire oed looking for other definitions to be offended by
precisely and having a disproportionate number of negative usage examples relating to women or any other group shapes how people use the language
the google ngram viewer is great for this type of stuffhttpsbooksgooglecomngramsyou can see a graph of the frequency of use of rabid feminist rabid fan and rabid nationalist over time by entering those terms in the ngram search bar here if you just put in rabid  of course the most frequent term is rabid dog interestingly rabid antisemite is more frequent than rabid fan nationalist or feminist and so following frequency in the language rabid antisemite should be the used example nagging wife is the most frequent noun collocation for nagging so clearly that should be used in the dictionary frequent usages like that tend to become part of the meaning of the modifying word an observation up to  the word men was more frequent than the word women in the google ngram books database after  the word women is more frequent it is fun playing with the data
ive been using they since my first tech writing job in  and ive never been asked about it in all that time no small changes wont change the world overnight but over time small changes are all that do change the world
surely they is ambiguous numerically the word you are looking for is it
i suppose a lot of grammar purists would be up in arms but it seems sensible to formalise this colloquial use of pronouns as the article shows it would solve a lot of awkwardness
please please tell me this is a joke
i forgot to mention that the alternation of male and female pronouns to which the author refers drives me to the point of derangement i cant believe im alone in that and invariably correct it
the belief that the pervasive use of he in english is sexist and that a blow can be struck against sexism by replacing it with something else is both false and intensely irritating to select only one example out of many the hungarian language doesnt even have a separate word for he and she but only the single word õ which does duty for both i can assure the reader that sexism is alive and well among hungarians male and female alike however so many people are convinced by it that as a professional translator and editor i cannot ignore their views and i now always use they as the author of this article advocates it really is the best solution
they the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in english the word sexism doesnt mean what you think it means
do people not use this all the time i know i do it just makes sense when the sex of the person is unknown or irrelevant eg if someone wants to get into town from here they need to get the number  bus is there any serious resistance to it being used in this way
i think it makes sense although part of me wonders whether they is the right word or whether we need another can we also have a generic term to follow dear dear sirmadam doesnt feel right soo a better option would be good ill declare an interest my first name could be male or female and i get really hacked off with emails that start dear ms because im neither dear nor ms if somebody wants to be formal and not use my first name at least they see what im doing there could get my sex right
isnt the issue with they that it sounds plural if someone tells me they have just brushed their teeth i wouldnt know how many people had done so so id be wondering who has still yet to brush their teeth and not follow dental hygiene protocol
imagine how tortuous daily live must be for this writer id feel sorry for her if she wasnt busy trying to tell me what to do
i never claimed to offer anything other than my own opinion and to be honest you dont really need to be an expert to see the contradiction and pointlessness in the article is that what you believe though that one has to be an expert to offer an opinion funny
glancing through some of the btl comments yet more pc drivel etc i just wanted to say from my not particularly avantgarde perspective middle aged white male corbynosceptic floating voter etc that i found this an engaging and thoughtprovoking article
im sure there used to be a sitcom about  elderly women called the golden girls
the guardian world can be very insular
oh boy
whatever cariad
it is i suspect that i may have been a tad too arch for you my point is that there doesnt need to be a logical reason for disliking what people call you just because dave is short for david doesnt make it my name and i dislike it thats all just as the op dislikes being called hun im assuming that she isnt german 
the last paragraph negates the rest of the article of course its always about context
try being called mate all the time sick of it
hows it so hard to fathom people dont like being belittled because its annoying its especially annoying when it happens routinely sure your attitude will determine how much it affects you thats true of every experience in life but its completely reasonable not to want to be patronised by colleagues
if one happens to be a person out to be offended then the vernacular offers many opportunities to become offended there may well be really important things to find offensive rather than the issue of being one of the girls or one of the boysbut hey any port in a storm luv
how about duck d
or complete cock
i cant remember it being so pronounced as that but she certainly had the accent even in those few words
how are things going lord melbury
not if you read the question its not
my grandmother used to run an old peoples home most of the residents were women they all referred to each other as girls maybe it is just your middleclass sensibilities at play here the world is bigger than your outstretched arms maybe you should open your mind a bit
words can do that cant they
she is sensing a honey potie your wallet
ello princess
how awful the entire world must change so that you are never annoyed by anything
the beach boys are still touring despite being in their s the beach men does sound a bit weird though
looking for apparent expert opinion also sorry i noticed just now your covered the hun territory in earlier posting
near newark notts as a kid elder sis visits from london with kids and in the village shop her yo gets addressed hello duck im not a duck he says seriously im dan
erm opinions differ dont you like debate
i plead guiltyive used the term love all my adult life my mumwho was born in  also called everyone she knew the same term of endearment all her life it is the way we are its lancastrian i also call virtually every bloke i talk toknown and unknownson it is just a couple of words it is not intended as an insult a few months ago whilst posting a comment i was pulled up by someone because i refused to use a swear word that is just the way i am some on here swear like troopers but then find the word love condescendingi give up
did she pronounce it moi loverrr if so she was from the west my apologies to possessors of the old and proud accent that i have probably just insulted
hopefully in a few years google will release a mid reading device so we will never offend each other again
no it doesnt really
you are mixing things up if a group of women want to call themselves girls that is fine what is not fine is in a professional context where women are referred to by their seniors as girls example some years ago a male colleague a bit older and more senior than i arrived with a stash of papers and asked when i was taking a photocopy for my research work if i was the photocopying girl
i dont mind being called love duck sweetheart etc when out and about at the shops on public transport etc i dont tend to introduce myself when i pay for my shopping or get on the bus so using a generic term is fine it really pisses me off at work though i always introduce myself to patients im a doctor and i would never dream of calling them anything but their name so i get quietly irate when i get called sweetheart back whilst all my male colleagues get to be called doctor even when they arent and are instead a male nurse or health care assistant
hear hear the guardian must have the courage of its convictions if an articles worth publishing it should be ready to withstand critique
to be fair that ad was a little sexist by most accounts
and lady cave
as a  year old i absolutely love it when older relatives still call me boy
any debate around language will never succeed in blackandwhite terms because it will always depend on the who what when where and why nutshell its good to question norms as long as context remains
yes i think its irrational to be bothered by words unless its a threat if someone called me good boy to try and patronise me so what what harm is done if they feel the need to try and patronise someone then theyre probably feeling just insecure
no guardian job for you then
so you dont like these terms as a man i dislike your characterisation of middle aged men as dads
true the problem with an article like this is not that i disagree with it its that its just so utterly stupid that respect for both author and publication is undermined
as a proud bristolian i would habitually and thoughtlessly refer to females as my lover in the early eighties an excellent female colleague and good friend questioned my use of the endearment i jokingly asked her if she would prefer the male equivalent my cocker or cock after the laughter subsided she asked to be referred to by her name
ive got three degrees and im a doctor and i get massively fucked off when i introduce myself to a patient and address them by their title and durban and get alright love back because funnily enough it never happens to my male colleagues who always get to be addressed as doctor by their patients
come to nottingham where a burly builder for example will quite happily call you duck regardless of your gender
i think i understood it call women women unless they are under  andor you farted at them in which case u may refer to them as a girl or a princess i dont object to any of that im just glad to have finally learnt the rules
heres a really revolutionary concept see if you can even begin to entertain it what if male and female are essentially different what effect would that have on your world or is that just not possible
its not his fault he works in pontins

ive definitely lost it some time about the time people in italian cafes started calling me signora i also stopped being called love dear etc etc about the age of  or  it was only the other day when somebody did call me love that it jumped out at me noone says that any more and i felt scorched insulted that id been called love it didnt feel kind but when i was a student in yorkshire every bus driver and shop person called everyone love
i call my girlfriends daddy little princess he really doesnt like it
so you think shes being irrational i dont i think objecting to being called good girl is perfectly rational the only beings that enjoy being called a good girl or a good boy are pet dogs cats etc definitely not people aged 
if you call me number  it will offend me
this is where your year goes well about  of it sorry to state the obvious but nowadays we use the words girls and boys as an affectionate word to talk about the team or as here the team around you this was an affectionate use of girls for his previous team but the guardian saw use of girls and negativity and figured there was an article in that which is absolutely pathetic
fair enough i never use those words when talking to adult strangers but im sure no offence is intended by those who do and theres just as many potentially patronising terms for men but do never use the words girl or boy what about ladies or gentleman even if your not addressing someone directly its a stretch to find these words offensive or even patronising
pubic hair
i understood lady garden to have another meaning altogether
ive been trying to type a response to this article but i might as well just moderate myself itll save time and effort
that looking at pictures of unreal women with boob jobs how do you know she had a boob job and wasnt real why do you have a problem with women that have boob jobs how does it harm you is really really juvenile well thats your view but whats wrong with being a bit juvenile how will it harm you
nice summary
pretty much what i thought when i read your original comment assuming people are being sexist or offensive without evidence is offensive in itself i dont suppose at any point you bothered to enquire why the item was on the wall or if he was the person responsible 
any form of address to either sex said with heavy sarcasm is offensive try it with pal mate sonjust as hostile
but it made me think of the countless times ive been called a girl or one of the girls by an older man and it usually is an older man but doesnt that kind of make sense if you were called a girl by a man younger than you that would be much weirder
oop north everyone does it more or less one of my macho builder friends calls everyone male or female duckie and he isnt trying to patronise them or get into their jeans the women in the supermarket call me love darling or babe without any sexual overtones its a verbal tic an overt signal of nonhostility not that the professional outragees will ever accept anything that simple and straightforward
possibly a dinosaur
im glad that the guardian has finally opened comments on a topic related to gender relations after dozens of articles in recent weeks what was good about the guardian was that it was a forum for debate not sure why this area has been off bounds really perhaps the editor should reacquaint herself with the works of js mill
we say the word luv in yorkshire but i remember the first time i heard someone say my lover when i was at college and getting on a train in leeds i stepped aside for a woman who said thank you my lover id never heard it before and thought it was quite funny i wonder where she was from lol
thats highly unprofessional to have that kind of picture on show in a place where you invite clients why cant people cope with an image of a beautiful woman will it give heart attacks
true bravery is asserting a ridiculous position and sticking with it
an overdeveloped sense of victimhood
i moved to ash by de la zouch and they called everyone duck
it makes the person saying it sound like a wanker
thats where all this is leading
i got my first cheque book in  and was ms even back then
i may be a dinosaur but i dont think i would get upset if someone called me one of the boys am i missing something
yet more mindless pc drivel
being called flower would amuse me its not a name id ever choose for myself i must say but for gods sake i wouldnt cry about it on social media the way so many young people are prone to do these days
coming from lancashire im totally chilled with love which is used for everyone regardless of gender however i drew the line at being told i was a good girl by my manager he was in his early fifties i am 
since most of them are under the age of  it is fine i went to a womens college in the early s and nobody ever ever referred to us or to each other as girls
is mancave wrong as well is my wifes studio actually her lady garden cave better or worse
the gents in my local is indicated by a regencystyle chap in a top hat and frock coat he looks nothing like most of the customers believe me
as i enter the office morning fellow humans i value you all as individuals regardless of your choice of gender identity just doesnt come to me as easily as hey guys i guess im a dinosaur from another era albeit only a  year old one
personage is very un pc collective entity is the new term and will be until about midnight when it will change to something else
sigh
i call my girlfriend daddys little princess all the time shes usually tied up gagged and clamped in various places when i do she doesnt seem to mind
complex i rather like ladies in running as in first lady but it just seems a bit pofaced otherwise probably because it is wrapped in class and suffocation ladies must be protected from stuff and have puddles covered up with cloaks and suchlike
its only really being called  good girl  that bothers me but what does this bother do to you what are its symptoms does it make you angry make you go off food make you feel depressed it only bothers you because you let it because you are responsible for your feelings you choose to be bothered by it another woman might find it sweet another woman might not even notice it
ridiculous article from its ludicrous premise to utterly bizzare end she suggested that gendered terms are not useful and that boys as much as girls are constrained by them and did she use the not useful gendered terms when making this very point it would be hilarious if it wasnt all a bit sad
it is about context and about normalising terms that diminish half of the population in my experience of living and working in poor countries for many years this is just as much of a concern as it is in rich ones
i was gonna respond and say that pensioners are treated very well indeed but this is just that thing where i notice the areas in which im underprivileged and overlook the areas in which im privileged isnt it
there is a documentary about breasts available to stream that actually looks at the purpose for these body parts and reveals the science that shows the health benefits for infants of breast milk and then shows how polluted we are with toxins that accumulate in breast tissue in men and women manboobs arent just about fat or fitness it is the nasty toxins in our food water and air that mean children of both sexes are experiencing what can only be thought of as mutations due to various forms of plastic and chemical formulations that are unchecked in our environment people think trans is a choice when maybe it is actually chemically induced boys and girls get your act together and start cleaning up the planet also think up some cool terms of endearment that will be all inclusive
yes fair enough i would never refer to women as girls in the context you mention thats different interestingly the spice girls were all well over  when they decided to go with that name and it was always girl power rather than female power unless it was referring to their audience rather than themselves anywaywomen are as guilty as anyone else of this patronising language arent they
why how conceited do you need to be to care whether some calls you mate or not its better than dickhead
it could be a factor of all the things to make an issue out of inoffensive terms seems to be something that should be at the end of a long list of problems
maybe so d where am i thinking of
why not just try grunting
its just you
it does in some cases seem to be taken as having meant men should never use gendered language whereas the actual article is more reasonable but kinda confused and doublestandardsy
big difference footballers are actually good at something and have something useful to offer so they dont need to invent offence in order to give themselves something to do am i the only one here who has empathy for those poor maleducated types who have nothing to offer but their offence
sigh
how do you say it
silly ms was introduced because women were justifiably miffed at having to announce their marital status on just about everything that had their name on it or every time they were introduced the same logic doesnt apply silly
i dont know which section of the store to shop in really you really dont know
mx tobia sounds like a really brilliant nightclub
dont tempt me
why not just m
yes absolutely i cant believe that some people still grimace at ms it is so annoying at my workplace they just cant cope with it and alternately write miss then mrs
to the best of my knowledge this isnt something that gay folk seem to have an issue with
is it pronounced mux or umx
it is difficult to overstate just how important this change is the addition of mx to the dictionary represents the beginning of an unprecedented shift in how western language thought and culture understands gender by adding mx to the dictionary the oed has embraced a future in which gender does not have to be limited to two options a world where people can determine their gender on their own terms through the addition of mx the oed has made a historic step towards ensuring that genderqueer gender nonconforming and gender nonbinary people like me can lead lives of dignity and respect its extremely easy to overstate this as you have just showed all the inclusion in the oed database implies is that the term has been used often enough and long enough for them to consider that it requires explication given that the oed aims for comprehensiveness these barriers to inclusion arent particularly high and the presence of the word carries no hint of approval nor disapproval and whether the term remains in use is irrelevant
ive tried to imagine how it feels to not feel like a man and not feel like a woman and i just cant always throwing me curveballs anyway it looks like were gonna need another set of toilets
yep good luck with that some of us are still trying to get ms accepted as a mainstream prefix even though its been a standard option for some time i will more often than not get asked if im a miss or a mrs
i never know which bathroom to use would it be inappropriate to suggest that you use the toilet appropriate to your plumbing failing that affect a limp and use the disabled loo
now if you were an mx youd be acceptable to loads of people mainly hairdressers
genderneutral toilets im currently trying to imagine the steely confidence that would be required to expel the previous nights vindaloo while simultaneously taking into account the  chance of a potential mate being three feet away from the scene of the crime
how about drs revs service ranks profs etc need to admit i classify for two of these
i was attending a formal dinner later that week and the rsvp required i choose whether i was mr mrs or ms i looked at the question and froze unsure of what to do so what did you do
should be good for scrabble
will we need one word for nominative case and one for accusative etc cases theythem seems to be evolving naturally as a possible alternative so why not leave it at that
yes we do and for all us not just the trans people could we use the old english pronouns of thou and thee second person as a basis we still use those words so we would need to adapt them tu tus tum and it avoids the th sound many speakers of english find difficult
i like per for the pronoun and pers for the possessive person as a root seems an appropriate worddont take any notice of the reactionaries they never represent the future
who exactly says that pronouns have to match in gender and number i expect it is the same people who say that to casually split infinitives is wrong because you know you cant do it in latin and english is just the same as latin oh wait and what about you gosh look it can be second person singular or plural abolish it at once we should all be using thou it was good enough for shakespeare and it should be good enough for us they as suncommitted was native in my fathers dialect he was born in  went to public school and was not very pc only idiot linguistic prescriptivists would reject it
artificially invented forms will never catch on the use of they is naturally evolving as a solution to the problem after all you used to be plural as can still be seen from its verb endings in time we will settle on its proper agreements themself by the normal processes of language change
go and learn german you can get some more cases as well
me too the number is determined by the context and im not sure the rule as stated exists at least not quite so formally thus is more a case of grammar than pc gone mad
their not the plural form obviously but in place of the definite masculine form his or the definite feminine form her
i know i dont understand the handwringing over this when the answers so obvious with the caveat that i also agree with referring to individuals in the manner they desire
i thought wed already come to an agreed genderneutral singular pronoun for all genders consumer
yes but i dont think you can say anyone is one of them
marge piercy tried this in woman on the edge of time gender having been eliminated everyone just uses per short for person but while you habituate yourself to all sorts of people and ideas while you read a long book this never worked for me it always sounded forced for those now considering commenting to suggest that theres a perfectly fine existing neutral pronoun they remember that pronouns must match both gender and number so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate grammatical accuracy doesnt matter words spring into use as needed we already say things like everyone can go where they want because saying he or she every time sounds worse if speakers wish to extend the use of the word they will and writers will follow
so in the case of single individuals its grammatically inaccurate its no more grammatically incorrect than german using sie and sie same word different meanings in different contexts that is allowed
is it time we agreed on a genderneutral singular pronoun no
if they is being used as a gender neutral pronoun it is not being used as a plural and the grammatical objection to it strikes me as weak particularly since its been used for that purpose for centuries i dont object to a new word if thats whats wanted but they is not the grammatical horror that some people insist
i thought them was acceptable in cases of unknown or irrelevant gender
look you can do what you want and speak how you want but lets get one thing straight you have absolutely no right at all to then start criticising others who dont use your new language have you got that because we know thats the next step on your road to guardian utopia it always is
did you also think samesex marriage being legal would mean you were forced to have one
yes it is the quakers im an atheist myself but for this and other reasons i do have a lot of time for the quakers the quakers refuse to use any honourifics and in the th century when english still had a theeyou split like the tuvous distinction in french they would address everyone with the informal thee form voltaires letters on england have some funny passages where he talks about people moaning about being theethoued by impertinent quakers
why do we need titles at all they serve no purpose whatsoever
i just love it that youve reduced a discussion about gendersexuality to a question of inches
well i am happy you are happy with mx as long as gender neutral titles are not forced onto me my opinion is that society is becoming steadily degraded into something very alien and strange but i feel strongly that people should feel free to be who they feel they are but i feel uncomfortable that gender neutrality is being forced you can call me her she and miss
just tell them youre a quaker and dont use titles
nobody is disputing the existence of gender disparity because it has absolutely nothing to do with this its a sad state of affairs that people such as yourself feel gender issues are being threatened by sexuality issues all the more so when you ironically impose gender issues onto an article about genderqueer people i assure you if you think there are fewer column inches about gender politics then youve simply been looking in all the wrong places
when it came into use it was automatically given to the divorced women not that it was ever the intention it seems that many married women just love to ensure everyone knows they are
this will be all irrelevant these titles will disappear soon i have probably been called mr a handful of times in my life its a dieing lexicon
yes dear you get a kiss on the cheek from me oh thank you thank you
like mind bendingly annoying bollox with out the ind bendingly annoying bollo
this seems like a whole useful and positive idea im glad to have been introduced to the term
genuine question how should people pronounce mx if addressing you by it like mix like emex or something else
i have always thought it was bit steep that women are identified by marital status mrs or miss then in the  s we had ms that seemed to only apply to divorcees at the time whilst men never had to volunteer a prefix to their name if you don t want to prefix your name just give your first name nobody really cares
oh come on squire no need to jealous im sure it can be arranged for a special bigot box to be included for you to tick
yes some people do but  recurring population of the world have no issue with it whatsoever
i like the solution of mx sounds quite coold apart from anything else however on a point of interest i believe that if theres no intention to defraud theres no real prohibition on choosing ones own title whether or not one has a legitimate claim to it is there best the rtrevd lord drrendel harris san serafino order of purity and truth rd class
i must admit that ive always been a little puzzled by this as well i dont wake up every day and think that i feel like a man i dont even know what being a man or a woman is supposed to feel like so im not sure how id be able to notice the difference i just feel like me and gender doesnt come into it in any way that im aware of im not trying to have a bash at anyone its just im just genuinely confused as to how those notions of gender manifest themselves at all let alone in a contradictory fashion isnt it making a rather large assumption about the way the genders should feel i would genuinely welcome an explanation of what being genderqueer even entails mentally speaking
i want to know this too or maybe its pronounced max eg child at school can i go to the bathroom please max robertson
if youre going to change anything about the way the world works in this respect thats the part that you should change this whole well i want a different title isnt exactly thinking outside the box when the entire point of mrmrs and all its foreignlanguage equivalents is precisely because the other person apparently doesnt feel they can process your request without first knowing whether youre a man or a woman why youd feel any more comfortable having to declare to this random stranger and their everlasting computer database that you probably identify as genderqueer i dont know you dont have to be genderqueer to wonder what business it could possibly be of theirs and from there feel perhaps a little miffed that you are compelled to provide the information before you can go any further given that these days this information is mainly demanded for things like buying something online or getting your bank statement sent to you its not as if theyre going to say oh sorry cant sell you that laptopbook you on that flight its for boys im happy to be called by my first name and while im sure there are plenty of people out there who dont feel sufficiently respected unless theyre called mr or mrs suchandsuch im not sure that those people are the voice of the future why not just have a no title option which would default to your first initial
ridiculous just leave it blank
its amazing how many people dont seem to understand what lexicographers do they record language use not set standards for it for instance if the word gay is in widespread use to mean something like uncool lame another possibly fraught term of course a proper dictionary has to reflect that all this inclusion means is that enough people on a bet id guess mostly people in american academia have started using the mx thing in writing for it to be recorded in the oed the only place where it matters whether or not a word is included in a dictionary is a scrabble tournament
for equality reasons i wish to have the title of lord
by caring so much about what gender label is applied to you arent you in effect buying into societys bullshit gender role system if he or she arent simple biological differentiations arent they nothing more than designations of role or class
gender politics seems to have been appropriated solely by the minority lgbt communities without wishing to offend these groups the biggest and most unresolved issue is the men versus women debate is there a m v w issue at all i believe there is and there seems to be fewer column inches spent on this important debate than that associated with being lgb or t men still dominate women in all religions tribes and communities and as a result we have a world being driven to destruction fuelled by testosterone this may sound apocalyptic but i invite anyone reading this post to rebut teach or inform me as to why im wrong in this conjecture
on official forms genderqueer isnt an option mx isnt just for genderqueer folk its for anyone who doesnt want to reveal their gender in the same way ms is for women who dont want to reveal their marital status
never mind what you identify as in my mind i am premier league quality central midfielder meanwhile in real life i am really not that give the special people an other option then they can write their stupidity in the little box dont expect normal people to come down to their level and shit up everything to keep them happy
m is the standard french abbreviation for monsieur
or frau engineer german ladies can be engineers too
some people do however have difficulty choosing what bathroom they feel like they belong in imagine you have no difficulty choosing the womens bathroom but have been assigned the gender of male at birth thats what it is like these sorts of things are not supposed to help people already comfortable with their gender its also unreasonable to presume everyone else feels exactly the same as you do just because you were assigned the female label at birth and happen to feel like it suits you that doesnt mean everyone else assigned the gender of female at birth feels the same
nice one centurian
yes dear you get a kiss on the cheek from me should we ever meet well done
this doesnt affect you you can keep whatever you like out of the present choices
like minx without the in
sheep say meh
no he is clearly identifying as genderqueer as he stated in the article
i wish to be known only as that was a blank space by the way can we have that in the dictionary
have you ever tried to buy clothing typical of the opposite sex for yourself women can get away with it as they have freedom of expression the male appearance does not have try it one day as an experiment where of course you dont have to buy but can go through the motions of which includes trying the garment on see what you are treated to of course attitudes vary where one might live in the country big cities are more tolerant but not everyone lives in or near big cities that are more tolerant
good idea isnt it the quakers who dont believe in titles maybe theyre ahead of their time
i had that same question myself the only thing i could come up with is that it probably sounds like the word mux which is a real word ive actually used its an electronics terms short for multiplexer it doesnt sound like a terribly respectful way to address someone does it i dont think it really matters though because in reality nobody ever actually uses madeup words like these in conversation theyre something that only exists in written form to placate a very small but very loudmouthed bunch of people sigh fine jacob well have the computer print mx tobias rather than mr tobias on the envelopes you get sent from now on if that will shut you up about this nonissue for at least a while
and this is people being forced to disclose something they dont want to disclose just instead of marital status its gender identity
ha ha speaking for myself as a disabled person i am just happy to have a bathroom to use when i really need one
jesus weptlets remove any idea of race gender sexual preference height weight age and just refer to everyone as widget
congrats more power to ya etc but i think you give the oed too much authority it merely records not prescribes nor even proscribes our use of language
you need specific qualifications for them
couldnt we just drop titles it would make life easier and people wouldnt have to waste time on deciding whether theyre ms mx or miss
okay dont even think about asking me to understand all of this though i believe that my gender has nothing to do with who i am as an individual i have no difficulty in choosing the womens bathroom i am female and to me a female over twenty one is a woman just as a male over twenty one is a man
no it isnt women were forced to announce something they didnt want to disclose not the same thing at all in fact its the opposite
no it shouldnt however for many services that have to be accessed booking flights bank accounts payment by an employer it is often necessary mx allows you to use a title in these situations without stating your gender
ho thank god thats a weight off my shoulders it did worry me some 
can i ask how its pronounced em ex or mux or something else
mix
right there in the article growing up i assumed that the only way to have a genderneutral title would be if i got a phd and could make everyone call me dr
of course there is an argument to be made that by pursuing identity politics we on the left are actually taking the trendy easy way out and doing the capitalists dirty work for them given that one of the most ferocious effects of capitalism is atomization atomization of individuals families neighbourhoods communities by celebrating and embracing an increasing plurality of individual designations we are therefore unwittingly further catalyzing the hyperindividualism of capitalism and thereby strengthening the systems core strategy divide et impera divide and rule at the same time we have in recent decades shoved to one side the really heavinglifting hard stuff at the heart of socialism ie capitalist economic exploitation and the accelerating disparity between the super wealthy plutocrats and the masses of people on this planet who live from pay check to pay check and the even greater masses of people who eke out a bare existence on a merely day to day moment by moment basis just a thought
you may like to check why neither mr mrs or ms is doubly wrong i know that one i know that one neither is qualified with nor and its a binary thing as everybody likes to whine about these days not a list of more than two choices do i get a prize do i get a prize
the same logic doesnt apply it does just swap out marital status and replace it with gender its the exact same logic
what does any of that have to do with the shops surely if you want a plain baggy tshirt you just go to the mens bit if you want a pair of jeans that makes your arse look fantastic go to the womens bit sounds like the best of both worlds to me
and in germany a chartered engineer will often be addressed as herr engineer as this is a protected title on a par with doctor in europe bit of a dr strangelove moment the first time anyone calls you it though
why dont you just buy the clothes you like from wherever happens to sell them
one interesting aspect is that if you dont tell them otherwise most people will assume youre male based on the fact that youre called jacob perhaps when people see you its obvious to them that you dont see yourself as male or not unambiguously so but if you dont want people seeing your name to make that assumption are you never tempted to switch to a genderambiguous name such as sam lee jamie cameron chris i suppose though you are probably attached to your birth name and would not wish to change it just because others have certain preconceptions
meh would suit better
im confused by this in the uk university accommodation is mixed not separated by gender i dont see why genderqueer people cant just fit in with this im also perplexed by the notion of genderneutral restrooms loos to me most of the time they would not be used if more space could be allocated to loos great but give it to the ladies amp accompanying children who have to queue now
how do you pronounce mx
sounds good to me not sure everyoned agree though
it is difficult to overstate just how important this change is its easy as youve demonstrated
if youre going to reference the oxford dictionary you or your headline writer or the subs if the grauniad still has any may like to check why neither mr mrs or ms is doubly wrong
by decentering gender and providing a genderneutral option to the terms mrs and ms mx allows women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature hang on there a gawddang minute wasnt ms supposed to allow women a third option that is not centered around their marital status or patrilineal nomenclature jesus words dont half wear out fast these days before long it wont be worth the effort of making sense out of them
i am slightly puzzled as to why you were put in the quandary surely you could have replied in the standard fashion ie jacob tobia thanks the host for their kind invitation to the event on date at place and have much pleasure in accepting i can see why any gender descriptor is required
yes disabled loos are multi gender and multi ability why arent all others or put another way why arent disabled loos gendered why are the disabled subject to different standards 
if you were an mx youd be acceptable to loads of people mainly hairdressers the mx is the worlds most popular sports car that is a lot of hairdressers i think you would be well advised to avoid themyou may already be doing that
ah the toilet debate of which appears to notably transfix that conservative bastion that is america where here how about this for a solution the same kind of toilets for everyone as you have at home whereby if you are partnered to the opposite sex and have children of different sexes you in effect have a unisex toilet applicable to all
try leaving it blank
 chance of a potential mate that is your problem right there
patrilineal nomenclaturethat must be a googlewhack
good grief
clearly you dont understand the gender queer life experience not everyone that transitions does so to the opposite sex many are between sexes to start with and finish with of which is when they find their comfort space ie that place where one is happy with themselves so they can focus on other things like careers and lives
lold
ah a wiki on the pronounciation httpnonbinaryorgwikimx it would be a bit rough on a famous survivalist who would be known as mx grylls
or even bunny heaven
if your a chartered engineer and appropriatly registered you can call yourself eur ing
too french
true the oed doesnt make the word official and doesnt claim to theres no such thing as official in english it does show that it has reached a certain level of usage though
cool the only thing is how is it pronounced mix
surely the question which requires begging is if it is now legal for people to use a nonspecific title which i seem to be quite within my rights to use to conceal my gender and may consider why do we need titles at all granted there may be some people who for whatever reason choose to let the world know that they have a big qualification or their ancestors were probably slave owners but in when we are attempting to eliminate gender prejudice why are titles necessary
mx
m good idea now bond ms moneypenny has the information for you 
there are some really intolerant closed minded people in this country which is such a pity including many of the commenters who have written before me if it doesnt hurtaffect a person to accept new ideas why rail against it what is not understood or experienced does not need to discarded the issue of a genderneutral title has great significance for a sizeable number of people for those whom this doesnt affect why not accept this new custom rather than write cynical or derisory posts it seems people who have not come across these societal changes in their own lives cant live and let live the sooner they or people close to them have experience of being an outsider in some way with all the repercussions attendant to that the better
or rabbit apocalypse
if you are a detective inspector commanding officer or prison officer
i dont understand why a prefix is required at all i have a name address me by that it shouldnt matter if i am a man or a woman
ive been hooked on the c coverage and have stayed up every night to watch the last leg after catching it by accident last weekend its had me in stitches and ive been recommending that people watch it alex brooker doing the bmx course in a wheelchair on last nights show was great
if we can make jokes and enjoy the olympics it should be on a par with the paralympics they both are a celebration of athletes and diversity
hurrah for such positive news
good article as for the bbc journalist feeling sorry for the first person to cock up how about feeling sorry for the disabled people who have had to put up with years of derisory language and usually in my experience at least react to inappropriate language with nary a care surely expecting journalists to understand some basic terms of reference isnt too much to ask
one of the bbc guidelines is to refer to other people as nondisabled instead of able bodied which is banned which i really like and im trying hard to adoptputs the boot on the other foot for a change er 
well exactly ive been mumbing resentfully for ages at friends whove caught me practising wheelchair disco dancing in public i tend to do pirouettes or wheelies if im bored that i dont see why i cant have as much fun in my wheelchair as i used to on my bikebut i have been a bit worried that the nondisabled nasties might if they watch the last leg which they probably dont might take it as licence and we might end up with vicious spaz jokes again still if it helps nondisabled people im practising to feel free to laugh if i make a joke about my own disability without obviously wondering if its really all right thats all to the goodi mean i make jokes about everything else actually i make cracks about my own disability but only my friends laugh nondisabled getting there strangers usually look a bit confused umm maybe theyre not as good as i thought
yes i quite liked nondisableda bit like calling straight people nongays rather than assuming heteronormativity
seen the pic a the top of the gs paralympics page today d
heteronormativityi wonder i found greek words for ablebodied as in seaman but havent a clue how to pronounce them only did latin at school anybody know greek so we can adapt that xxxgreek wordxxxnormativity
ive been really disappointed that more hasnt been made of the events here in the usa as theyve been totally overshadowed by the political conventions thanks to the guardian for some great articles and for updates from my mum on how c has done
fortunately we are ceasing the use of offensive terms for the physically impared it does seem though that asa society we have yet to cross the barrier with those with learning and other mental impairments it seems quite acceptable indeed de rigeur in some circles to label all footballers and certain ones in particular as thick im sure that many paralympians would find this totally offensive
where the beijing olympics inadvertently highlighted human rights abuses our legacy has been to inspire a generation to appreciate the quirky funny diverse multicultural and caring modern britaini hope it inspires people to appreciate and attempt to fulfill the british potential for being caring in relation to disabled people were heading in the opposite direction at the moment and we cannot afford to assume that we are above a total lack of humanity the public is being led to believe that giving a toss about anyone but yourself makes you some kind of political extremist however i think the paralympics are proving to be something of a setback for that particular campaign good
 chris moyles who regularly used gay as a synonym for anything undesirable or inadequateid be interested if you can substantiate that statement with examples as i remember it was said once to describe a ringtone
is this just a puff piece for channel  you couldnt find anything bad to say about the way in which the bbc writes or talks about disabled people so you went to the way in which it didnt condemn moyles when he used the word gay i was offended by that but its not the same thing it was a tenuous link to allow you to have a pop at the beeband of course the paralympics is the main event at c because its the only thing they had for them to say anything else would be absurd but when you compare the coverage of the paralympics with the coverage of the olympics the paralympics is still a secondary event i am only referring to this in terms of the length of live coverage and the number of channels broadcasting it despite the adverts and the overuse of studio chat channel s done a good job covering paralympic sport but the media generally including the daily mail which has featured the paralympics prominently on its back pages has covered this well too theres been very little of the patronising isnt he brave language the athletes are seen as exactly thatso im struggling to see your point other than to praise c
one other thing while im on here in your comment above you saida bit like calling straight people nongays rather than assuming heteronormativitywhy did you call straight people people but didnt call gay people people when did they stop being people and started being just gays why didnt you use the word straights its a bit like calling disabled people disableds or black people blacks
i love adam hills comedy he brings out the ability to laugh at both himself and other people in a very inoffensive way i think he took it off and was waving it around one time on mock the week had me in doubled over 
oh no the damaging and unnecessary urge society seems to have to define and therefore generalise about people based on a single aspect of their person is bad enough but lets not start defining people by what they are not how about we just stop trying to put people in nonspherical containment devices
its pretty clear that we mustnt use words associated with disability in a derogatory way and most of us know we that words associated with mental illness or learningdevelopmental disabilities are similarly offlimits but some language im genuinely not clear onis it still ok to ridicule someone who as far as we know is in good mental health and doesnt have a developmentallearning issue but who behaves in an irrational or unintelligent way and if so what language can we useeg was it really ok to call george w bush an idiot or say something he did was stupid and was it ok to say paul gascoine was mad before it became obvious that he had mental health troubles if someone says something illogical is it ok for me to say thats crazy batshit crackers or is the only acceptable solution to go all spock and call it as it is illogicalstupid crazy etc are so much a part of normal speech even used by fairly righton people who would be mortified at the idea of degrading people with mental health or other issues but in  years time will we look back on these as being unbelievably unenlightened times a bit like watching clips of love thy neighbour from the s

down here in the west country it is not rare for shopkeepers to refer to their customers women as my lover best that you do not come west rebecca
edgy
i always thought dave was short for david my name is daniel but most people call me dan if i ever have a daughter i shall not name her elizabeth because everyone will call her liz
or just read the whole article and realise that no one is trying to deprive you of any words
i suppose the guardian could send its foreign correspondent up to see us maybe its a long way from london
the author says it is about context not about making universal rules
what a terrible way to go thru life listening intently for an inadvertent word to be offended it really is rather sad i bet you dont have many friends
i always found it quite friendly and endearing to be called poppet whenever im in the north east completed baffled me the first time and it tends to be from middle aged women but always came across as nice and friendly best bit of language really regional accents colloquialisms and just general phrases that make perfect sense to you but are totally baffling to an outsider
sorry you cant say brave little soldiers it infers they arent brave and have small willys please apologies unreservedly to all the people i have taken offence on behalf of
no because you are an old man every possible grouping or subsection of human beings imaginable can be reckoned to have a long history of being treated badly
if you hadnt chosen a username for your account here youd have been given one
no hes right not uncommon in liverpool but always my or rather me never to refer to someone elses woman
not up to you to decide what should bother people and what shouldnt never suggested it is my point is i believe her feelings of being bothered are irrational so what if someone calls you dear or love what harm will it do to you
if you read the article you would know that the author isnt talking about how people choose to describe themselves but about context
im a man and i would rather be gorgeous than brilliant gorgeous people get buy with much less effort regardless of sex
it may just be me but it seems very few commentators btl understood or read the article

ginger posh baby scary and sporty the spice women doesnt quite go does it how old were they 
iya love leeds as well
no thanks im  and look it anyone calling me a girl will look like an idiot
genuine question whats the issue with being called ladies
hear hear better yet why do people need to talk to each other at all consider all the problems in the world that wouldnt arise if people just stopped talking to each other and everyone lived entirely alone communicating only through some sort of official channel
not really the article is pretty much a word annoys me sometimes people have differing opinions about that word its possible that word choices can influence childrens views context is all whats wrong with that
my boss greets the office every morning with good morning boys and girls needless to say he is widely despised and yes he does wear funny ties
yep removing the butt stick would help in most situations
theyre just words theres no logical reason to be bothered by them
said agent 
too right mate
what if he had said the women abandoned it but with stress on the word women context is important but the way words are said makes all the difference also now that i am  am i entitled to take offence at being called old man after all as a pensioner i am a member of another group with a long history of being treated badly
if i walked into a room full of girls id say good evening girls likewise if i walked into a room full of boys id say good evening boys seems ive had it wrong for a long time i suppose now id be better advised to say good evening things
the faux annoyance at girls thats developed recently is ridiculous nobody gets annoyed at football managers calling groups of grown men the boys
that seems to be the goal
noted i shall henceforth refer to those of apparent nonmale gender as female personage eg two pints and a bag of nuts and one for yourself female personage hopefully i will be informed of any infringement should said person be of trans status 
i am over  and never even in my s referred to my women friends as the girls nor indeed to my adult male friends as boys
oh sorry i thought you were complaining about sexism turns out i had you  the wrong way around youre one of the sexists the article is complaining about
sorry my typo my bad its the stags youve got to worry about there though
so youre telling me the eva herzigova bra advert was actually sexist against men for its hello boys line
behave yourself ffs all the problems we have in this broken country of ours and being called  mate  offends you and you friends get a life you sap

what a sad article you go girl is one of the great modern feminist chants of encouragement lighten up girl 
yuk
i wouldnt like endeerment to happen to me all that hanging about in woods
yep i think they just got their google alert with the keywords gendered and language before copying and pasting from the pc brigade banning language files ok not quite but sometimes it feels like that have to say though i dont see a problem with hollywoods language in this case since i cant see any indication that its patronising in any way
well i can understand that rebecca nicholson was exploring the use of the term in this article whereas flic everett seemed to take full offence at it all in her past article without exception
the bar girl in the local pub calls me honey whenever were having a chat im a man and i find it quite alright
why the seemingly deep need evidenced by the comments on here to call people anything now retired i help out at a charity that gets visitors and so interact with them regularly i feel no need to add love darlin duck sweetie or whatever on to the end of my sentence when talking to them how can i help you or have you visited us before work perfectly well on their own with people of both genders and all ages especially if you add a smile
i often try explaining to my wife why referring to grown women as girls is wrong but she just wont have it
why do you look cheap

you sound fun
dont let him offer to get you on the ramp so he can have a quick shufti underneath other than that you should be fine 
except when my wife an extremely competent professional woman of  tells me shes going to be late cos shes off out with the girls i postponed the boys poker night cos i was babysitting get a grip love
the sooner we get numbers the better
daccord mon petit chouchou
its always amusing to see the antipc brigade responding to articles such as this one brave little soldiers that they are
a now departed italian gentleman who definitely liked the ladies used to call me of similar persuasion caro or dear one no offense meant none taken
give her a break you think its easy finding something to take personal offence at every day lets show some empathy for those whose only marketable skill is the taking of offence
girls girls girls
i think this is part of the wider debate as i mentioned earlier its only really being called  good girl  that bothers me im not  i think its reasonable to assume that an adult of either sex wouldnt want to be addressed as a good girl boy
i was about  before i stopped looking behind me to find out who the man being referred to was
it was meant to head off criticism thing is its a trueaccurate statement about many feminists what others find acceptable and fun they have a problem with only until they want to engage in the behaviour and then suddenly its fine
ello dave
agree hate it as well as sweetie
please no everyone over the age of  is an adult for some time young woman or a young man but not a girl or a boy
see response below
it really is disgraceful what women still have to endure in this day and age perhaps if they were covered up say with some sort of veil and their husbands fathers brothers were made responsible for their protection by accompanying them everywhere and making sure they were never allowed out alone and defenceless then this dreadful persecution could end
go to another mechanic the one i go to only has pictures of cars on the wall
wow actually i and a lot of other people think that looking at pictures of unreal women with boob jobs is really really juvenile in the real world honey bunny you have to get used to people thinking that way
or in ipswich around the same time got a loight boy got a loight
calm down dear
my local has half a bar full of what the locals call the lads theres not one of them not drawing a state pension
and why is queen an acceptable allpurpose greeting it is just as gendered as girls unless one includes some gays in a sexist way but that is wrong because the correct form is quean a bit more logic please
a male colleague at work calls me hun and it really irks me i am sure he does not use this with his male colleagues i made a similar comment about a female work colleague referring to men as boys and asking me about my sex life but it was deleted by the moderators for some reason
and lets not forget monagatehttpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreemaynamepronunciationsecondgenerationimmigrant
yes except the article is a contadiction in terms
thats highly unprofessional to have that kind of picture on show in a place where you invite clients but hey maybe its a warning sign enabling you to dodge a bullet are there no other mechanics in town
sorry misunderstood yes its hard to see how good girl could ever not be patronising
i once had a colleague who called everyone comrade annoyed the hell out of everyone at work ive always preferred being called my name
women and gay men find men with muslcesmoney more attractive is it really a stretch to assume that a comment from someone they rate as attractive not be filtered through that before judged for what they actually said
not sure whats wrong with mate though give it time somebody somewhere in a gender studies department near you is working on this as we speak
although pronounced hum are you sure it isnt a contraction of honey things could get sticky
in uni summers i worked in a hospital department reception the middle aged women who worked there called me every ludicrous name under the sun they had a naked dude calendar on the wall and tried to embarrass me at every opportunity with constant inuendo middle age men are not the exclusive protagonist when it comes to inappropriate sexist language
bravo
haha
i get the feeling that youre somewhat confused by various terms of endeerment you were offended by something paul hollywood said that wasnt even offensive and you ended by not really being bothered by it yourself there are different ones in different regions that are just common everyday language it easily becomes obvious when theres hate and misogyny behind them like with any other terminology but generally its not the case crucially of course its all about context exactly right always remember that luckily youre not as far gone as flic everett was when she wrote this article for the guardian httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejuncallingwomenloveendearmentinsult its all very well being a moral crusader about various things but be careful not to end up out of sync with everyone else as the majority of the comments under this article prove
reminds me of a sergeant major i knew
my name is david i hate being called dave especially when ive introduced myself as david there is no logical reason for my dislike other than the fact that dave isnt my name
this is so true male friends of mine are fed up with other blokes assuming it is ok to call them matethe sooner we rid our language of these inappropriate uses of such words the better our society will be
shes allowed to be bothered as it is awful not up to you to decide what should bother people and what shouldnt my dear nearly always sounds incredibly patronising because of the way its nearly always said
in nottingham it was usually duck
how about writing something that is actually worth the pay you receive i go to the supermarket and get called love darlin and even young man by people not just women but men too the difference is that i dont write a lucrative article for the guardian so i just take it in the spirit in which it was intended which is innocent and friendly if you have a problem you should confront the one with whom you have the problem oh but wait that wouldnt pay the rent would it
i am male to my grandmother i was always my ducksto my mum i was love except when she was crossat grammar school i was gumby remember the pythonsarriving at university in leeds i was taken aback to be called love or flower by male and female alike but got used to itin bristol on the market i get regaled as my luvver by women ive never metto my wife i am beari call my wife pussycati called my son my big strawberry he grew to hate it groups of women always seem to refer to collections of men as boys making lots of derisive comments about boys toys who cares
that the author is making a big deal of something pretty unimportant and harmless in most cases these kind of words are terms of affection but obviously can be used in a negative way you need context thats not too divergent from what the author says in the last para
when i was a boy i expected to be so called or perhaps  chap by a peer or father young man a little later or when my father was annoyed or years later by an even older person although boy wasnt always out of place as in events dear boy events cut along young lady
i just use people it covers all bases i suspect that you dont in practice the people are coming over at pmim probably going out with the people tonight
i know many in the trans community who prefer they to me it sounds impersonal
this is not pitching the sexes against each other though is it she is simply suggesting we adopt a gender neutral word
as a translator from italian a language in which the masculine form is the default when talking generically i have been using they as a singular pronoun for years when translating into english in order to avoid transferring this inherent prejudice also because i find heshe to be stylistically cumbersome i didnt realise it wasnt more widely used
seems like a change rather than a correction as a mater of interest do you always change it to he or do you alternate
beat me to iti was going to say we were here centuries ago with the second person pronoun its about time the third person caught up
 my first name could be male or female  not if its claudio 
i agree there are languages worse than french
it is right they are out of date
this has been debated for decades and not surprisingly peoples usage has decided they can be a singular third person pronoun done and dusted only old farts and pedants get upset about it
only if youre confused between gender a grammatical category with sex a biological one which is something native speakers of english are prone to since english doesnt have gender you could just as well argue that french is feminist since when in french you refer to someone as a person une personne you then have to refer to them subsequently using feminine personal pronouns
personally i think the concept of coming out as non binary gender is a bit daft its saying in essence that you dont identify with a category youre supposed to fit into but by coming out as non binary you are reifying binary gender why not just say i dont identify with gender categories its like coming out as an atheist
and she is arguing that it should be adopted as such i think youve missed the point
im one of the rabid feminists of which oxford dictionaries speaks in this case it was feminist writer ann oakley who spoke wrote of rabid feminists oxford editors chose the e from a wider selection of sample usages of rabid in the oed
of course you can start teaching it use it in official communication and it will help in due time
yeah but if you dont know if its he or she
likewise been teaching this to learners of english since  and not claiming any awards for coming up with the idea i taught it that way because thats how it was used
this sounds like fixing the symptom not the causeusing a genderless word doesnt do anything to prevent genderbased discrimination and therefore does nothing at all to address sexism sexism is a state of mind not a state of vocabulary the words are simply a description that follows this approach is also culturally insensitive as it only considers the form of one single language to say that using genderless words solves sexism makes the implication that all the latin based languages french spanish italian which assign a gender to almost everything must therefore be sexist this is obviously a complete fallacy as a language has no feelings or opinions solving sexism in both directions requires people to be less confrontational less divisive less willing to try to prioritise one gender over another less abusive and less dismissive if the media wants to take a lead in this it should be celebrating people with no mention of irrelevancies such as gender race eye colour or height it should be not engaging in identity or gender politics and not pushing role models based on exactly those divisive attributes it then demonises
another issue i have encountered here is the expression my partnerwife many people find this offensive as they say it implies possession thus perpetuating the outdated concept that a wife is the property of the husband the issue then is how to change this saying the person to whom i am married seems rather clumsy
id differ slightly id say if its used and understood its right thats if i understood your second sentence correctly 
because english words are invented by popularity and general consensus this issue has neither
no you cant be permitted applecart before horse its beyond the paleface i hope i have killed two birds with one stone the crows
if something has been in common use for  years such as the singular they but hasnt made it into formal grammar then thats a failing of the grammatical system
i do that quite often because i dont like to write heshe hisher etc being not a native speaker i sometimes give myself some license of freedom with the english language ill put it down to accent if somebody complains 
it is of course true that all nouns have a gender in french which seems quite unnecessary to me but there are only two genders in french whereas in german there are three so ones chance of being correct if one has to guess is only about one in three rather than one in two in french
as long as we continue to use a language that is inherently sexist we will be forever perpetuating sexist ideology even without intending to so lorraine berrys idea is that using the english language properly in other words correctly employing one of the greatest cultural triumphs of any civilisation means you are perpetuating sexist ideology furthermore she thinks this sort of nonsense is an important fight there truly are people out there to use my old yorkshire grannys phrase who dont know they are born
simply dont understand why a new word cannot be invented as previously all words have been just like new law is made when need arises
bloody frogs eussr grumble grumble send em all back
you cant proscribe or prescribe language change
i teach english as a second language and have been teaching my students the use of they as a gender neutral singular pronoun for many years i didnt know i was being such a feminist and nobodys ever told me they had any objections to this use
it can also be used as non genderspecific singular it has been for decades
surely if you know the person or know their gender it is stupid to use they
madchinchillalady they is a plural pronoun and as such is not appropriate when doubling for a singular noun whats the problem with using he or she when the gender of the noun is not stated or is not obvious
grammar purists are always just wrong because there is no such thing as pure hard and fast rule in english it all depends on usage whether there are some people who dislike change or the fact that english is a language perpetually in flux is there problem
if someone told me theyd just brushed their teeth i wouldnt have any trouble working out that the they amp their were singular pronouns in that instance ive always used that err usage
they is plural there is no singular genderless pronoun
french spanish italian russian can you imagine the guardian if it was a spanish language newspaper why is a street a girl why why why and why should a car be male are you saying a car cant be female etc etc thank the lord this lot operate in the one language
weird ive always used it that way nobody has ever questioned it including in academic writing i have seen she used as the default by many particularly american writers and not only in overtly feminist writing it seems jarring at first but that only serves to underline how inappropriate the use of he in this function too i always notice and feel uncomfortable when he is used to represent a person of unspecified gender this is a fight which has maybe already been in principle it just takes a while for some to catch up
or perhaps we can simply remember that he and she are interchangeable depending on the circumstances instead of being knowbs about it
quite they is a safe refuge from taking a stance making a judgement i use it often not just to hedge bets though just in general course of least resistance giving least chance of offence being taken
its not wrong if its usedits right
does not prevent
sorry just made the same point didnt see your comment
ouch
turkish has no grammatical gender but that does prevent turks from being sexist the premiss of the argument is flawed
i don get the sexist issue here what is wrong with specifying a gender or writing he or she when it applies to both they is also an option in other languages they have the same issue french is actually more sexist as when referring to a group of  women and one man it uses the masculin pronoun
im an english as a foreign language teacher and have been teaching my students to use they as a nongender specific pronoun for years just doing my bit for the cause
i loved the per short for person used instead of herhis shehe that marge piercy invented for her novel woman on the edge of time
i prefer xe httpsenwikipediaorgwikigenderspecific_and_genderneutral_pronounssummary they sounds clumsy
newspeak what did winston smiths colleague syme at the ministry of truth have to say about this in orwells 
you wanna try greek
but which would they prefer
certainly not when used by buffalo bill it rubs the lotion theres certainly a sense of logic in bills approach though then again this movie clip would have been plain weird if it had been made in guardian land they rub the the lotion on their skin
many things in english and indeed other languages can be ambiguous in some situations but we still manage to communicate effectively
trying to pitch the sexes against each other is purposely regressive and destined to fail as proven by the computer all decision making is binary zeros and ones yes and no good and bad when the brain has aggregated all its minded thoughts it comes to a decision the idea of a nonbinary person is grade a nonsense and a state of denial
growing up with a heathen dialect ive used they all my life english is lucky the swedes have had to invent the abominable hen to cover a genderneutral pronooun
i think therefore they are
i always use they in academic writing heshe is derided as being bureaucratic in my field it is also inaccurate i can be referring to a he a she or a genderless it i see plenty of others doing the same it is more accurate to have an indefinite nonsingular pronoun it could be worse the other day a chinese colleague said that they represent good by combining two symbols girl and boy i wanted to discuss heteronormativity and the ascription of goodness but such discussions normally get glares and awkward silences
like
i cannot remember not using they for a situation with unspecified gender is this actually news
the word you originally denoted a plural but we use it for the singular as well
so youre advocating something like this if anyone comes round tell it im out urgh
they mix you up us gender folkthey do not mean to but they do so just write wrongs with second sexand take our granma with you too
bad link sorry heres more on singular you and they
ok yeah they works i do use it although i probably get more use out of it for animals whose sex is unknown dont want to use it for them might it be better when speaking generically as you suggest to still use she rather than the technically neutral they though if you refer to a surgeon as she then that draws more attention to it requires any picture formed be of a female surgeon while male is still treated as default to an extent a surgeon referred to as they might still be pictured as male might be more likely to be despite the apparent neutrality of they as the default
french is the real culprit a room full of women plus one man and its ils masc plural shocking
you has a similar ambiguity but people here used genderneutral they for centuries and it is rarely ambiguous in practice
you is ambiguous as it can be either plural or singular in practice it doesnt cause a problem when a friend uses the word you can tell what they mean
been using they for at least  years
does this debate rage in those languages dominated by distinctions between malefemale nouns like french and italian
even people who complain about singular they tend to use it unawares they dont like seeing it in print because theyre not used to seeing or noticing it in print editors have a responsibility to allow a usage that has been normal and grammatical at every level of english for centuries we gotgthttpstancareywordpresscomsingulartheyyouandasenselesswayofspeakinggtgot used to singular you we can get used to singular they
sorry still prefer to use he for a man and she for a woman
while the push to use they as a genderless pronoun is new for english not really while i remember reading an old grammar book  years ago where the author noted that his grandaughter was using they where gender was unknown and he thought this was a splendid advance personally i have never known a time where this was not true as i used to teach my tefl students there are three uses of they in the singular  gender unknown gender irrelevant to the situation at hand and most deliciously  i dont want to share the gender with you as in darling sorry im late i ran into an old colleague at the station we had a quick drink before they caught the train
the article is unclear as to whether its suggesting that they be used where the gender of the person is unclear or irrelevant which is where it is used now without any but the purest of the purists objecting or whether it is to be used where the identity and gender of the person is know i phoned my mother they were in the bath and shouted at me does ms berry describe her own doctor whose gender she knows alternately as he or she or does she mean that if talking about the patientdoctor relationship in general her illustrations will alternate between genders
harry picked up their toothbrushhermione picked up her toothbrushdid they pick up the same toothbrush
this is one of my pet peeves even bbc reporters do it eg the woman was standing on the roof and then they fell off
im from yorkshire we already do this plus youse rp southerners struggle as their wealth and power is historically and presently based on the paternal rackets of banking and empire
they solves the sexism problem apart from the grammatical problem that they presents will they not lead to an usversustheyism
i know it wont happen in my lifetime  please dont be so defeatist if any one sufficiently interested tries it out they might find theyre part of an unstoppable trend
imagine if this was what you spent hours and hours thinking and worrying about we must live in a very comfortable world when this is seen as a big enough problem to be posted on the website of a national newspaper to the author i can only suggest you get out of the echo chamber you yourself describe and talk to some regular people they might have some more important problems to discuss my god
dear personyour gender does not concern us 
they has been being used in this way informally at least in american english for at least  years i have used it myself except in formal written communication where i would generally write he or she which does not interrupt the flow of the written word the way it would with spoken language attempts to invent new words to fulfil the same function have failed as deliberately introduced language never seems to gain the traction of that which evolves see ref esperanto any authoritative recognition that they is used as a gender nonspecific singular pronoun is welcome in that it would help to allow for the usage to become accepted by dictionaries style guides and the like and i could stop writing he or she
its a legitimate objection this overloading of the word they is exactly why its atrocious to use it to refer to an individual of unspecified gender its much more elegant and clear if we could settle on a ze or ve or something like that
the context of the conversation would almost certainly provide that information for you ie you were talking about either a particular person or a group of people in the preceding sentence if someone just came up to you and said they have just brushed their teeth i think instead of thinking i wonder if they are talking about multiple people or a single person you would be thinking what the hell are you on about
how very singular
gtgt surely they is ambiguousthats generally the idea often in work it doesnt pay to reveal too much information about an incident so they is perfect for reducing the complexity and potential fallout
many languages largely do without personal pronouns for the most part context is key in korean it is relatively rare to use first second or third person pronouns and it causes no confusion among native speakers
they is clearly wrong as it denotes a plural but its such a small subconscious slip to allow it to refer to a singular person as evidenced by the fact that many do make the slip that i believe it should be deliberately encouraged its preferable to introducing a new or foreign word heesh ugh similarly for them theirs i cant see heshe disappearing when the sex of the person or animal is known however
yes well two of the four nongendered language she chose are related to each other viz hungarian and finnish i dont think that the language is the cause of the sexism this seems to me to put the applecart before horse if i may be permitted the neologistic phrase oh well why bother to respond btl shouting in a vacuum nothing is heard or seen in guardian house
if one wants to get into town from here one needs to get the number  bus
ive been using they to describe an individual for years as has anyone that has more important things to do than waste time determining the gender of folk they dont need to know
but it just isnt nice and fluffy enough
i was encouraged when writing essays to use heshe which became annoying after a while they is perfectly acceptable what a lot of fuss over grammar these days really the tories get into power and all the little generals start polishing their gripe buttons lifes too short to be a tory
is there a difference between striking a blow against a practice and refusing to perpetuate it surely as a professional writer you believe that language does matter
only in the guardian
forget reforming english fix french first im learning french and gender in french is a real pita
isnt the issue with they that it sounds plural context will usually sort it after all german manages with sie as a multidisciplinary pronoun
this is cart before the horse i think youll find language forms develop quite naturally to express ideas that we value and not language coming first if we really wanted huge numbers of labels to pinpoint exact relationships then these would already be in use but we dont because most people dont really care that much who is related to whom biologically or artificiallyin relationships people are more concerned about whether there is a lovingcaring situation and thats it how many people do you know that go around asking did he provide your sperm whats she to you so we end up with partner or friend or even just names to use the it analogy we didnt invent google before we had google neither did we have any of the it words before they had something to representif we did then wed be talking about say deprolixationations which as we know hasnt yet occurred
how about using peoples actual names rather than their rolestitles it already works for many families
surely there are also children who are raised by two parents who would like to have had only one of them or who would have liked to have had different parents alltogether so this seems quite irrelevant
politically correct nonsense living with your biological heterosexual parents is clearly the default situation anything else may work well but isnt the default situation
is the uk really as conservative as the comments here would have me believe surely nontraditional families are not that unusual in this day and age i am belgian and when my dad was a child  years ago he felt really different and embarrased being raised by a single mother his dad died when he was  but by the time i was in secondary school around  years ago i would say about a third of my classmates were not living with both of their biological parents or at least not at the same time in dutch there are many words relating to nontraditional families like bommoeder single mother by choice meemoeder the nonbiological lesbian mother though i havent heard that word in the last decade or so nowadays people just accept a child can have  mothers nieuw samengesteld gezin a family with children from previous relationships plusouder a nicer way to say stepparent i am a single mother and ive never ever been asked what it is like to be both mother and father that would be absurd i have been asked if i adopted my daughter because shes mixed race though for some reason an interracial family seems more unusual to some here than gaydivorcedsingle parents
who said anything about breaking them up you did if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen the heat in this context is rude and intrusive questions about a non standard family rebelraising and andrew solomon need to stop bleating about how unfair the wordsociety is to them and show that their parenting is more important than what they are to be called how is rebelraising the problem why should she have to put up with rude and intrusive questions what shes doing is perfectly reasonable
im sorry you had that experience which although perhaps extreme is certainly not unique both of us could cite intra family relationship problems springing from poor parenting however poor parenting isnt per se an indightment of the nuclear family structure but of our own parents experiences as a child comlicating a formative childs life by contorting family structures isnt going to help
or not
ever since i began to think for myself i have found myself inventing words one of my latest is nonument i live in a city suffering an uncontrolled mass invasion of tourists barcelona who so love visiting monuments castles cathedrals palaces etc which are more or less the petrified excrements of some of the worst people and organisations in history a nonument is wherever people gather to remember the mortal and other victims of these as far as i am aware nonuments exist in name only
aha or as you might say lols
outside of teenage chat rooms anyway ill take your word for it but one might wonder why youre frequenting them
what does heteronormative mean it sounds as though it might mean heterosexual something but what and if it does why is it needed we already have a term for that relationship several so is it a derogatory term is its fellow homonormative is there also a term for hetero nonnormatives homo nonnormatives
and when that term was used nobody complained that legitimate children were not also lovechildren but they were and because the term was very silly it died out soon
who cares about whether the father is biologically related or not the man who helps bring up a child is its father why not stick to that
why bother people who reject traditional ties of marriage in favour of modern opt outs puzzle me because i dont get why they want to be different yet the same all current husbands wives sons brothers daughters gran and inlaws cousins etc suit the majority if the minorities want their own terms let them come up with them weve already become accustomed to partner and get that that word no longer describes only businesslegal people we can get similarly accustomed to other words as soon as those to whom different nomenclatures refer can agree upon those terms but those people who have over the decades introduced different irregular life and lovestyles did so because they didnt relate to those of the majority and thats fine for them if they dont want to be in let them be out but why should the rest of us care
its spelled says outside of teenage chat rooms anywayim not surprised theyre after your vocabulary to be honest
good try but you were wasting your efforts he didnt like the word tyranny and wasnt prepared to listen throwing disatracting argument after distracting argumentthe important thing is that people here were prepared to listen reflect and think a little more deeply i certainly was a good article
sez you
some people think that times have not changed its just that we are more capable of chronicling things like family relationships than we wereyou would not have the problems if you stuck to christian principles eh ehhhgay and lesbian clergy our mother in the pulpit and all manner of freaky things going on there too so many ethical problems for us to answer as we take the onward pilgrimage of self improvement on the way to heaven
no you lost that all by yourself
theyre after my sense of perspective as well
ah so it is like the stasi your oppression is noted and amnesty international have been called of course you wont be able to testify to your hideous experiences as your vocabulary has been stolen never mind your sense of perspective
i think it has been for about  years or so so not really news
not exactly the stasi is it first they came for my vocabulary and i looked the other way
i do speak from a position of white heterosexual privilege but its a privilege now
that language has always been used to sweep the harsh truth of heteronormativity under the carpet so thats what that stuff was and now ive hoovered it up and binned it
without history nothing really gets to mean anything if by history you mean intimate knowledge of your relatives relationship to you i dont agree i grew up with many aunts and uncles who were obviously just family friends who took an interest in my growing self it didnt seem to confuse me in the least and i dont think i was a particularly perspicacious child i suppose the honorifics meant i avoided the remote mister and mrs and the lessthanrespectful firstname only if it worked then couldnt it now or do we really need to carry around a mental family tree
and he spoke from experience
the point was there was no offence taken in the first place you groundlessly insinuated it
why do you aska because thats essentially what youve previously said andb because if you dont think that then your entire argument is as specious as it is pointlessotherwise well done you are now free to hate anyone and anything to your angry little hearts content as long as you dont actually hurt anyone
either not have them in the first place or be prepared for a lot of patient and generous explaining who said anything about breaking them up i have had hiv for  years im still explaining to people why its not dangerous to have everyday contactsexa rubber of bridge with me its tedious but its all part of making the world a more enlightened and accepting place rebelraising and andrew solomon need to stop bleating about how unfair the wordsociety is to them and show that their parenting is more important than what they are to be called
offensive language all of it
yep because thats how language evolution works a righton petitioning article in the guardian theres certainly no way such a piece could actually bolster resistance to the recommendations it makes and it does much to relieve the danger of selfparody with which the publication flirts to boot
and there we have it explain your thoughtsoh dear god youre becoming hysterical its a discussion site explaining your thoughts is more or less the point you however clearly find this deeply upsetting in your selfperceived victimhood poor love
simple definition dear the meaning of words so of course you fail to manage a rational responseas for anyone who uses the adolescent cliche lol in a post about anything more serious than justin beibers hair enough said
societal expectation to call a family friend aunt no societal expectations to show respect and deference to older people think of it as like a queen if thats easier thats good example not everybody respects the queen i find your inability to recognise that disgusting by the way it shows a white centrism i find your response laughable and your attitude to australian indigenous people patronising and racist its all the funnier for the fact that youve bought up judges and queens clearly you dont see tribal elders as performing an important role nonsense nothing in my posts suggest anysuch thing i just dont patronise indiginous people by supposing that their elders must allways be without fault and therefore invariably worthyof and receiving respect the difference you should recognise between a council of elders and a queen though is that the council will easily cast out someone if theyre doing wrong by the tribe and they might cast them out for other reasons to which other members of the group may not all respect them for even if they dont all dare declare it maybe thats why you dont trust a council of elders and seek to disparage indigenous culture its not me thats disparaging indingenous cultures its you with your racist insistance they all must be perfect
so im assuming that you would prosecute the antisemitic graveyard attack as a simple act of arbitrary vandalism like smashing a phonebox yes and i would consider the mental anguish caused by the criminals in their sentencing
so are you actually claiming that the difference between a time when homosexuality was a crime and the situation now represents a loss of freedom not at all why do you ask because you think ludicrously that we are no longer allowed to hate what part of hate crime confuses you what particular hateful thought have you been prevented from enjoying recently and how and there we have it explain your thoughts what a confused and bizarre little man a are you canadian bye bye
premeditation ie prior thought a thought crime lol you know im just gonna let that one sit for reasonable people to laugh at
premeditation ie prior thought a thought crime
so are you actually claiming that the difference between a time when homosexuality was a crime and the situation now represents a loss of freedombecause you think ludicrously that we are no longer allowed to hate what particular hateful thought have you been prevented from enjoying recently and howwhat a confused and bizarre little man are
the hate crime component is gold plating and political and it has no basis in common law yes it is political to counter the political use of violence by the far right and to further the political aim of protecting minorities who wereare subject to harrassmentviolence etc and sentencing has always been affected by motiveseverity of crime so i have no idea why you are pretending that sentencing guidelines re hate crimes has no legal basisprecedence you equate understanding hate crime with being a good person no i equate understanding hate crime with knowing what im talking about and thus not making ridiculous claims that hate crime laws are arbitrary you are the only one who is going on about feeling good or bad or whatever but hate crime has nothing at all to do with being a good or a bad person i am pretty sure that murdering someone just because they are gay makes you a bad person an opportunistic attempt to leverage the good feelings you have about yourself for understanding it into acceptance of and mindless obedience to a thought crime regime this is complete busllshit it is about protecting vulnerable people from real life harmful situations with years of history and historical precedence i lived in london when david copeland went on his  week bombing spree including bombing a gay pub that i sometimes frequent do you think everyone realising this was a hate crime spree after he bombed brixton and brick lane gave them a warm glow of moral superiority or do you think it made jews gays and ethnic minorities worry what he would do next before he was caught if you want to sit in your bedroom worrying about whether hate crime laws make you feel like a good person or a bad person then go ahead i suggest that is because you are lucky enough to be in the demographic group that they have zero practical effect on unless of course you were to commit such a crime yourself
by the way whats the difference between murder and manslaughter if not the intentions and state of mind of the perpetrator premeditation ie planning
by the way whats the difference between murder and manslaughter if not the intentions and state of mind of the perpetrator
im not implying youre a homophobe to use your pc term im countering your preposterous salami analogy the implication of which is that our precious freedoms are being whittled away by the thought police its not really my analogy its actually a pretty standard way of describing the acquis communautaire but you wouldnt know that unless you were more widely read on the topic like most people labouring under this fear you are happy to pretend that everyone is less free now than previously not pretending anything weve gone from being allowed to hate people to it being a crime thats a pretty precipitous loss of individual liberty id say its very easily proven wrong ask the ghost of alan turing what he thought of prior freedoms or someone being turned away by a no irish or blacks rental sign happy days it is illogical to compare individual discriminatory acts with the universal imposition of thought crime and no globalisation whatever thats got to do with anything is not a religion for which one can be prosecuted for blaspheming your need to stretch to such silly and ahistorical hyperbole strongly suggests desperation i will answer this in a separate post
so im assuming that you would prosecute the antisemitic graveyard attack as a simple act of arbitrary vandalism like smashing a phonebox

davi bowies space boy do you like girls or boys its confusing these days
probably only works if thats actually her name 
the fact that you might not understand the history of crimes against minority groups doesnt mean that hate crime laws are arbitrary or that they criminalise thoughts all of the examples of crimes that you offer incur sentences for the harm they have done the hate crime component is gold plating and political and it has no basis in common law you equate understanding hate crime with being a good personso you emphasize your understanding and downplay the lack of legal basis for the hate crime embellishment but hate crime has nothing at all to do with being a good or a bad person and even it if it it is not illegal to be a bad person it is all about quietly folding stateofmind into the commission of a crime in an opportunistic attempt to leverage the good feelings you have about yourself for understanding it into acceptance of and mindless obedience to a thought crime regime
exactly
what colour though we all have a colour
the hate component is arbitrarily attached to the actual crime it isnt arbitrarily attached its attached in certain situations where historically minority groups have been subject to crimes which affect the whole community rather than just the individual who was victimised if a jewish cemetery is vandalised with swastikas it isnt just vandalism it could be a message that the jewish community should fear neonazifar right activists if a gay person is beaten up coming out a gay bar it might not just be an assault it might be a message to the lgbt community in that area that their place of safetycommunity is no longer safe to them if an asian family get a break through their window it might not just be vandalism it might be a message that asians are not wanted on a particular housing estate etc etc the fact that you might not understand the history of crimes against minority groups doesnt mean that hate crime laws are arbitrary or that they criminalise thoughts
i bet they she didnt realise all the fuss it would be causing centuries later its the problem of having on the one hand a standard in which nouns can be a number of genders but spread relatively capriciously between them to a language like english where most nouns have collapsed into being neuter and so gendered nouns refer only to animate beings or often specifically persons such rules the masculine stands for both for example then look remarkably obtuse because the linguistic status that justified them has changed completely
you missed the commenters point completely
right on cue
there seem to be a lot of people here who regard this article as a terrifying example of the evils of liberal state oppression and thought policing yet who lovingly hark back to the golden era of freedom when young policemen would hang around toilets hoping to catch someone with the incorrect sexual desirespeople are funny
a hate crome is an act of criminal behaviour not a thought give me an example of someone prosecuted of a hate crime with no specific criminal act the hate component is arbitrarily attached to the actual crime thats my point it shouldnt be and what is the criminalisation of homosexuality or divorce laws needing proof to the state of illicit sex but a piece of social engineering thats discrimination which weve had laws against for years was that part of your ratchet or was that just the good old days youre implying that i am a homophobe why
and blasphemy a thought crime if there ever was agreed and globalizing has become the religion that must not be blasphemed against
and blasphemy a thought crime if there ever was
a hate crome is an act of criminal behaviour not a thought give me an example of someone prosecuted of a hate crime with no specific criminal act and what is the criminalisation of homosexuality or divorce laws needing proof to the state of illicit sex but a piece of social engineering was that part of your ratchet or was that just the good old days
its really quite obvious els not to me try again love to ill wait for your clarification since i have no idea what it is you want me to respond to
well i dont recall being asked as an unborn child back in the good old days what kind of family i wanted to be born into perhaps you wereif i had been it wouldnt have been the particular repressed angry and bitter nuclear setup that i was born into though you seem to know better somehow
its really quite obvious els try again
so what youre describing isnt anything akin to an active thought police but the means by which society gradually changes in any direction bemoan that if you like but calling it thought police is just stilly the current state of affairs is that for example hate crimes laws are effectively thought control hate isnt something that the state has any business dealing with nor is it a relevant component in the commission of any crime theres an argument that stateofmind can be taken into account during a sentencing hearing but whether you hate someone you murder or whose property you vandalize is irrelevant to the loss of life and the damage done criminal laws are designed to address harm not stateofmind and even if hate were relevant how does someone prove hate and how does someone who hates a legitimate human emotion turn that off to commit a crime and thus not be permanently susceptible to hate crimes effectively a hate crime is the criminalization of a state of mind that is thought control and those who enforce that control are thought police so yes the thought police are here and yes they got here via the ratchet method of political control and social engineering this isnt an eitheror proposition
i thought we already had words when you introduce someone to your significant other they can go ah so when the significant relationship terminates just add two letters le covered both coming and going
us western english speaking folks forget that we are in fact in the minority on a worldwide basis culturally and languagewise we are so full of our own opinion about what is morally correct in terms of language usage in this article that we ignore what fast populations of the world think about these issues i referenced china and india to show that a very large part of the worlds population use languages that have family constructs are diametrically opposed to what the author is proposing and that the author is in fact well in the minority with their viewpoint
weve got one normal
exactly thank you for that note of sanity 
do you have any evidence to prove this claim the general presumptions are in favour of respecting parents it is your claim that the presumptions should be changed therefore the onus is on you to outline your argument and submit it for critique
the norm is that parents love their children and this isnt altered by the fact that some biological parents are not good parents parents have legal rights as parents and obligations but i suggest that nature not law nor custom drives these relationships you seem to resent them being respected by society the state the law better reason than resentment is needed what are you arguing for exactly and on what grounds
nobody is it remains a matter of some debatemainly parts of old staffordshire and worcestershire warwickshire is close and bordered upon it in the north west of that county before the creation of the west midlands county back in the s handsworth now part of brum used to part of west bromwich which is generally accepted as black country before older boundary changes we cant claim bill but accept that he was a brummie 
shakespeares from warickshire of course does that count as the black country im never quite sure where it begins and ends
haha yeah i bet they she didnt realise all the fuss it would be causing centuries later
i do
opposite sex couples do though have options when trying to conceive surrogacy andor third party sperm donation is not usually at the top of the list the authors family is obviously an extended group in which the surrogate mother can fully participate i understand the mother of the children of elton john and his partner plays a full part in their upbringing as does the mother of michael jacksons children despite being excluded in the early years i think the family of a same sex couple should be extended to include a surrogate mother wherever possible though maybe not the sperm donor father the relationships are though problematic and the difficulties need to be handled sensitively i agree that opposite sex couples should also be aware of the effect of surrogacy on the biological mother as well as the child and didnt mean to imply otherwise i referenced the programme long lost family which highlights the longing of some adopted children to find their biological parents as well as the longing of mothers in particular to find the childen they were forced by circumstances to give up i think it supports my assertion that there is a spiritual dimension to childbirth which cant be dismissed it is not just another bodily function
i cant make any sense of your response to factormax whatsoever would you mind explaining to me
you do understand that frightful sneer is your interpretation of his words
growing up in the s and s in the black country which has an old dialect im reminded it was commonly used in speech i had almost forgotten it was educated out of me funny old world
the son or daughter of a man is quite often not a biological relative of at all thats why we have existing hyphenated compound words like stepson and stepfather fosterson and fosterfather why not use them the alternative to using those existing words is to invent new words either way the core words of father and son still describe a specific biological relationship
context man context and the worst translation ever go read the greek original you can take any snippet and like statistics support any view you want to hold but im sure god loves you even so
then again newspeak does rather go with thought police doesnt it 
not to mention the subtle can work beautifully
but what does any of that mean if you cut the words off from their original root meaning surely what gives these terms meaning is what has historically been expected from biological parents rather than something they can choose later dont get me wrong you may be the best father in the world to those children but that term father only carries weight as part of a wider language and the network of expectations and responsibilities that its use implies short version without history nothing really gets to mean anything
hurts doesnt it nonheteronormatives get this all the time theres nothing wrong with a woman having children and such do you really not understand it was entirely deliberate playback of that
except they dont the son or daughter of a man is quite often not a biological relative of at all until recently the mother of a child might be the grandmother or possibly sister of the actual mother especially when she was young and or unmarried ditto with adoption of course that language has always been used to sweep the harsh truth of heteronormativity under the carpet
i suspect the readership have learned a little about some of the new thoughts i think whats most disappointing about this place sometimes is that new thoughts are met with suspicion and derision as a potential threat against which any ammunition must be utilised in order to destroy it very few seem to show the inclination or willingness to even listen or understand what is being said
only used for politicians now i think
i give up my wifes sons and daughters are just that to me even if i had nothing to do with their conception their children are my grandchildren why go to all the trouble to explain it all and who really cares anyway
again you have no evidence of this at all and certainly not in context of the canadian bill you might call this an unknown but you cannot call this an outlier sorry no need to apologise youre still wrong of course and of course theres evidence that most aspect social change and calls for progressive social change havent involved criminalising people or seeking to do so there are exceptions youve identified one but it would be false to suggest this is representative of social movements or that it is the likely outcome let alone intent of those who call for it what restrictions this is nonsense it sounds like prevarication i think if you took a step back and read the article properly rather than single out individual words to criticise it would become a little clearer weve already established the context of precedent which even you were forced to acknowledge were still some way off you acknowledging that context of precedent involves looking at the full picture rather than finding one example and then saying all follows from that baby steps i suppose but recent ones do this is not the placid s of your youth my youth but assuming you werent around then read a history book or two regarding civil and social activism of the s and s it wasnt placid that said i dont think theres anything more you can offer to this argument the case is made and its a supportable one nothing of the sort your case consists of interpreting the text based on not what is said but what you believe the writer really meant citing context which you achieve by ignoring anything that doesnt fit your argument and relying on cliches and inaccuracies of various civil rights movements this notion of the tyranny of biological appreciation and language is certainly an interesting one how can you find it interesting if you wont acknowledge what the point actually is but you assure us on the basis of no knowledge that it isnt your claims arent based on any knowledge and the nazi comparison is absolutely ridiculous im just surprised it took you so long to play that card
that we have relatively few words to describe familial relationships father mother son daughter brother sister grandfather grandmother these are all words describing specific biological relationships all of which still apply to those specific relationships moreover they have applied equally accurately through the ages regardless of any changing social fashions around them they only become less meaningful when they are hijacked to confusicatingly describe other relationships new words can be invented to describe any social ie not biological relationships and be replaced as and when the social context they refer to changes
so were agreed then that to say something must happen isnt to suggest a compulsive intent the author above saying that he wants this language to be abandoned implies a hard eventuality or else why should we abandon it it suggests a desired outcome it doesnt suggest his intent regarding the means of getting there saying for instance we must save the planet doesnt mean were going to compel people to do things they dont want to do it this brings up a further point abandon in favour of what who will have a say in these new terms what are they incidentally he doesnt say the terms should be abandoned but that the restrictions that adherence to those roles should be abandoned

which ive done its not representative of the usual trajectory in matters relating to social change its an outlier of it again you have no evidence of this at all and certainly not in context of the canadian bill you might call this an unknown but you cannot call this an outlier sorry re abandon hes talking about the restrictions rather than the words themselves what restrictions this is nonsense it sounds like prevarication as to must ive just noticed its not a word he himself uses but i dont think its a word that inherently suggests compulsion again this depends on context weve already established the context of precedent which even you were forced to acknowledge but most calls for change dont encompass calls for criminal prosecution but recent ones do this is not the placid s of your youth this is the millennial era of instant societal gratification at the hands of the authorities i trust no such social call couched in such a way that said i dont think theres anything more you can offer to this argument the case is made and its a supportable one being that the graun is the standardbearer of authoritarianism well some kinds anyway these days and this article being what it is i suspect the readership have learned a little about some of the new thoughts and ideas coursing through the internet these days this notion of the tyranny of biological appreciation and language is certainly an interesting one smelling kind of like a little gleiwitz but you assure us on the basis of no knowledge that it isnt so im sure everything must be fine thanks for your suggestion but with the greatest of respect youre not someone i would look to for lessons regarding the use of language or argument good with the greatest of respect youre not a student i should wish to take credit for
no its not authoritarian telling someone not to do something is no more authoritarian than saying something must be done that depends on speaker and context donald trump saying that something must be done implies depending on context that it will be depending on what that is could well imply an authoritarian eventuality the author above saying that he wants this language to be abandoned implies a hard eventuality or else why should we abandon it this brings up a further point abandon in favour of what who will have a say in these new terms what are they incidentally its you who felt the use of a word or command was sufficient from which to establish compulsion see above this is truly a myopic view
its not just about me nor even is it about views with which i sympathise i know that may be difficult for the self centred leftist to comprehend but there we are so let us consider pc uk try furthering a career even if you can avoid prosecution while unabashedly expressing viewpoints as wide ranging as pro israel anti abortion christian pro traditional marriage climate change scepticism opposition to mass immigration or just dissenting from the idea that people should be viewed as abstract groups and decisions made about them based on this fact or try not funding the state media monopoly to pound home propaganda and brazenly demonise the above or find a state school which doesnt tub thump the same messages in the wider milieu transcending the position of individuals the country and others like it are breaking down socially and economically because of the policies and behaviours that pc licenses and its influence on lawmaking before you return with pavlovian responses about bankers banking has acquired its inflated powers as a credit based economy has been necessitated by the social consequences of pc
im glad of that i dont credit it to pc though in fact pc is implicated in whipping up all kinds of hatreds eg against jews christians etc and also enabling racism by non white groups the main different between leftisms is their preferred scapegoats
by mis representing the remarks made by the examples in the article all credibility us list what a waste of space
ok matt you keep telling yourself that the next time you abuse someone in rage its only human nature
give me free speech over political correctness every time and that doesnt mean throwing common courtesy and good manners out of the window no one should go out of their way to hurt anyone else but that shouldnt mean making people scared to express their views which almost always will upset somebody so go ahead and express yourself and if that means some politically correct person calls you bigoted or racist so be it
gary oldman is a very good example of why actors are better off reading someone elses lines
another piece twisting the facts to suit the writers prejudices the problem is we can all go to other sources now to see what he said in context and this wasnt it
the problem with pc isnt being prevented from using certain words which we all find offensive anyway although it can get to the level of newspeak the problem is having your thoughts and feelings monitored the  aspect and being told that young offenders or jihadists are better than you because they can play the victim card
isnt this article sub judice then
what a very confused commentary one reaches the end still wondering where the author actually stands regarding pc however i do take very strong exception to the closing assertion that equality is a human right this sort of statement overlies an unacceptable undertone of entitlement what is a reasonable expectation is the expectation of equality of opportunity the two are absolutely not the same thing at all for those who would disagree on principle we need look no further than differences on age size and strength intelligence and geography amongst many other factors which make a mockery of the assertion of a right to equality this sort of assertion is stupid and if not dealt with rationally dangerous
oldman was correct and should rescindapologizefor his apology
though generally they do people arent meant to get on ok with each other it buggers up the establishments divideandrule thing so political correcters are encouraged to blow anything they can think of into nearenough a cause for localised war thus ensuring divisions for future exploitation theres also the diversionary aspect see how the political correcters froth about page of the sun and ignore the rest of that paper despite page being by far its least toxic content
the left were the first to be duped by it many seem to have abandoned socialism and adopted politicalcorrectness instead but it does also crops up on the right as in tories libdems and corporate executives and the neocons almost always used selectively ie hypocriticallya control technique to stifle or censor debate or electricfence matters that ought to be discussed but now effectively cannot be some say its the cia psychological warfare division that was largely to blame for the widespread infliction of political correctness
no it is you who has a comprehension problem and are easily duped
or one billionth rated replies to tenth rated comments do i win
if you use racist language when drunk it means that you are a racist you just hide it better when youre sober
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures then it is a shame that you are construct an alternate reality in which oldmans words are remixed and decontextualised to the point that hes made absolutely reprehensible comments this article could have been so much better without building a premise from halftruths
happy holidaythats what i say to people who are off to spain for a week
you need to go to east africa and get them to stop using the m word 
we all know that n word means nigger and p word means paki so why are the codes any less offensive than the words themselves because abbreviating them helps with a sense of moral superiority and lays it open to everybody surely if its good enough for gangsta rappers with mass appeal its good enough for everybody the n and p word thing is just simptomatic of the witless pc brigade who cant wait to show everybody how correct and contentious they are and feel morally superior because ultimately words are only words they even go through fads the only issue is intent and as people have such problems with defining intent they favour word censorship
the right wing use the term political correctness as a way to bash those they sneeringly call liberals but as has already been pointed out political correctness is merely modern parlance for politeness and consideration and the right therefore attack those they mock for being polite and considerate they also use europe in the same way because if we were not in europe and we were not polite what exactly would the right wing have to latch onto for their populist inflammatory rhetoric
whilst its fair to say there is unacceptable racism from a small section of all races and creeds i think its also fair to suggest only examples of white racism and bigotry are highlighted by the guardian
you say you want diversity but when someone disagrees with you violence is threatenedi used to think that was a silly bumper sticker til i read your post thanks for your demonstration of totalitarian thinking you just have to hope that you will always be physically stronger than your adversaries
gary oldman good actor but a man of limited experience of the worldpathetic 
this isnt what is termed political correctness oldham has made blatantly racist references n is obviously a very offensive term that is hated by black people and why make pejorative joke references to jews i would have thought that in the st century such attitudes towards black or jewish people were a thing of the past and why does he think it is acceptable to use pejorative terms about gay men
this article should be taken down what oldman said may have been wrong but its journalistically unethical to put words in his mouth nah let it stay there as an fine example of pc journalism as with offence and verbal harassment generally in which intention is irrelevant it is how the victim feels that matters it is what the hearer takes to be the meaning of what he said how they feel about the meaning they perceive that is the only thing of importance it does not matter what he actually said any person who feels offended or aggrieved by what he actually said is entitled to present what they feel he really said and explain that those are the true meaning of the words you begin to feel like a beetle called gregor who has turned up at the mad hatters tea party
do try actually reading what has been said rather than going off at an irrelevant tangent to fit your own prejudices what i wrote was  political correctness is about control control of thought processes and attitudes by those like miss okolosie who would have everyone conform to a political dogma not a moral standard which has very little to do with your waffle above
having read your post id probably be a bit more judicious with the use of the term halfwit if i was you
because youve been bitten by the dog you fed
i think ill call the police what dreadful language you have just used im mortally offended its a good job insults and jibes only come white society what are we to do perhaps we could deport them all to aus
you mean that whilst you avoid saying it out loud because you know you wil be rightly reviled you are in fact a closet racist sexist homophobic bigot fine but dont project your own unevolved mentality onto everyone else
you are a bit unwell arent you
this article should be taken down what oldman said may have been wrong but its journalistically unethical to put words in his mouth he doesnt claim these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman as suggested here he suggests everyone has said things theyd rather not see repeated that everyone makes prejudiced statements he got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things were all fg hypocrites thats what i think about it the policeman who arrested him has never used the word n or that fg jew im being brutally honest here its the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy mel gibson is in a town thats run by jews and he said the wrong thing because hes actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him but some jewish guy in his office somewhere hasnt turned and said that fg kraut or f those germans whatever it is nor does he suggest women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts he refers to one woman as a fucking useless cunt not pleasant maybe not true but neither is it a sexist generalisation which is what this journalist has sought to turn it into
the right has consistently trounced political correctness but many adept rightwing politicians regularly use it to their advantage nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive nasty own goal for pc
hope all who read this nonsense take the trouble to look at the full text of oldmans interview and tongueincheek apology to the despicable bullies of the adl i dont think lola can have
this thread will close in a few moments and reopen in the morning gmt thank you for all your contributions so far
well the word equal has taken on a sense of having the same value as a human being so to state that people become more unequal as time goes on could be misused in debate our genes clearly lead to different levels of strength intelligence etc to those who know about genetics i apologise i am sure i am getting the details completely wrong but for example while i am generally reasonably intelligent though far less so than many on here i have no decent strength and thanks to a squint atrocious hand eye coordination so in a knowledge economy job i am in a good position but in an ei would be crap were i sent to war now as we live in a knowledge economy and one in which your job and earnings have a massively exaggerated impact on your reputation i would probably be well regarded but clearly i have no more intrinsic value than any other human being and given that my job doesnt feed anyone build shelter educate or keep people healthy its intrinsic usefulness is questionable there is relatively good evidence that a less bright but rich child will be ahead of a bright child from a poor background for several years at school so of course we have inherent aspects but i wouldnt call these qualities as a world of intelligent but weak people would actually probably be shafted but a more equitable start in life would allow people at least to have a more level playing field
if the nigger is now unacceptable to use in the context of black people due to its offensive nature to them then it is acceptable to use it for a different purpose spanish speaking countries use the word for colour and did so long before it was used by americans words and meanings of words are constantly changing so if a different generation wanted to use the word for a different meaning then it would not be offensive
please prove what you are saying like relentless minority name names give figures we have a right to know if you have a right to know about the comments we make has it ever occurred to you that people have chosen to be the way they are and no amount of attack on the person will change their viewpoint as regards the troll comment i always thought that if you are replying to the comments you are more likely to be the troll but define a troll to me because it seems to be used by people who dont want to reply to comments that they find to difficult to answer
i dont like radishes i dont like one direction i dont like jordan i dont like football am i not allowed to express these thoughts yes because saying you dont like radishes is not offending anyone but when discussing people people with feelings you cant name them as faggots or niggers because theyre derogatory names given to a certain demographic that are highly offensive there is a big big difference
that is your opinion and you do not give examples to back up these statements by the way if a person disagrees with same sex marriage positive discrimination or feminism they have a right to those beliefs even peter thatchell agrees with that that does not mean that they are guilty of any crime perhaps we should use the same language of the pc and call them reactionary bigots
well you seem to have cobbled up a circularlogic formula which could prevent there being dissent or genuine discussion about almost anythingwhich is of course why the now globalized politicalcorporate establishment deploy political correctness as one facet of their ongoing psychological warfare against a general public over which they are the selfappointed dictators despite sometimes pretending to serve
you are now giving examples we were arguing about if someone who does not want to change their language such as the example you have given chairmanchairwoman then that is their choice and have the right to do so for whatever reason the pc brigade who then jump on the person to correct them to use their terminology is guilty of intimidation and attacking that persons freedoms of speech thought and expression and it is examples of that nature that you yourself have given that the unpc hate you for and will never agree with your point of view no mater what names you call them
he got reinstated not because he was innocent which he was but because it became known that he was homosexual which at that time ranked higher in the political correcters peckingorder
just who do the political correcters think they are to decree what can and cannot be said is this a haiku anyway every has an opinion you can feel free to ignore it or not
an excellent reply im  and what i have learned is that nobody likes hypocrisy whether its the rich and powerful the journalist earning a crust or the apparently wholesome individual keen to label other peoples behaviour while in private behaving much the same way at  i have also learned that it is impossible to reach  without having slipped into hypocriay once or twice myself life is really rather complicated d
of course its arbitrary it is whatever the bullying nudgefreaks deploying it find expedient for it to be at any given time a semantic variant of shock doctrine dont even bother trying to appease political correcters because nothing other than total control will ever satisfy them and theyll keep moving the goalposts in any case because they derive such selfgratification from exercising that element of control and power and they certainly dont want to lose it via everyone having complied with their dictates so these dictates keep getting altered
hi wartypig you ask do you require in depth scientific evidence well yes that was sort of the point of my post or at least some sort of evidence you describe articles like this as so numerous that it can begin to sound like a witch hunt and you say that if the media constantly tells people they are racist sexist homophobic etc then some of the innocent will feel guilty because these are very strong claims i posed the questions i did and because i wasnt able to find the numerous such articles you referred to i was hoping you could point me in the right direction so i could look them up for myself however youve cleared things up by saying its all merely your impression by the way if youre not referring to eg the daily mail and the daily telegraph are you saying its the guardian thats in danger of beginning to sound like a witch hunt or some other media by the rest of us i meant the rest of us reading your post and who may like me have felt a bit confused about what was meant cheers
theres no way that hatred of the totalitarian hypocrites known as political correcters can be banned
just who do the political correcters think they are to decree what can and cannot be said
it used to be okay to call someone a cripple now its not seems to be perfectly ok for the government the opposition frontbench and various of the massmedia to kick them though
political correctness is bigotry with a selfrighteous expression
this one doesnt
but people endlessly complain about all of those things some of these things have ended up in prosecution the idea that theyre protected or anyone is silenced from criticising them is a nonsense
how about gangsta rappers and the whole thug life thing muslim patrols in the east end of london burning poppies and waving placards calling for the beheading of those who insult islam parking caravans in random parks grass verges or car parks refusing to move on then leaving piles of garbage and sacks of soiled nappies thats just a few examples
thanks snakeshole for taking the trouble to elaborate i had in mind a different kind of monitoring id been wondering why in an era of the snowden revelations about government mass surveillance of whole populations and the news international phone hacking scandal all without the knowledgeconsent of citizens comments seemed to be geared towards the apparently overbearing nature of pc language and people feeling they were being monitored for it in other words i thought whos really monitoring us that and the fact that in other countries policing and monitoring of citizens behaviour is rather more severe than it is here so it struck me that the whole pc thing in this country was a bit well hysterical however i take the points you raise did used to work in local government although a long time ago when it was actually a fight to get equal opps taken seriously unfortunately it does seem nowadays that the original intent has often become mangled into a topdown bureaucratic exercise which is part of the corporate sausage machine where journalists are concerned its just a fact that theyre obliged to earn a crust by getting a story which will sell papersdrive people to the website catching people making gaffes etc is part of this although occasionally when directed at the hypocrisy of the rich and powerful i think its warranted
yes i am aware of hitlers predilections funnily enough and as i said that is why my father and others of his generation fought and in many cases died to defeat him i dont quite understand why you immediately assume that saying what i damn well please is going to involve racism i dont like radishes i dont like one direction i dont like jordan i dont like football am i not allowed to express these thoughts
i think thats true people tend to parrot things unconsciously sometimes they hear something and it and later it comes out of their mouth without them thinking thats not to excuse it but just to recognise that if someone says something in a fit of rage they probably dont really mean it they need to apologise but its not necessarily a sign of them being a bigoted extremist
because to really say whatever you damn well please at all times without regard to others is rude ignorant and generally bullheaded anyone with an ounce of simple decency or even anyone not actually a sociopath is aware of the effect that their words have and of the fact that they live in a community of souls not just an arbitrary collection of shouting selfish boors and you may have noticed that hitler was very keen on promoting the right to use racist abuse too if you think about it
ok so ill change that to many with a tough upbringing in the white working class will recognise gary oldmans opinion but disagree with it although this seems a bit semantic we could start by looking at brits from a humble background like oldman who have made it in hollywood oldmans stance would almost certainly not have been held by say richard burton one of  children of an impoverished welsh coalmining family who was a lifelong socialist or by sonofalorrydriver bob hoskins who described himself as left wing and a feminist then there is oldmans own fanbase almost certainly mixed in terms of race gender and so on his opinion will be shared by some some of whom do not share oldmans own particular background and rejected by others some of whom do on the matter of lenny henry on  july  the stage newspaper for the uks entertainment and performing arts industry reported that in television alone only  of the workforce is made up of people from a black asian or ethnic minority group down from  in  and  in  given that the last census shows that the countrys black and minority ethnic population hovers at around  lenny henrys comments dont seem unreasonable or at all controversial even if  were reached it would still mean that  in the industry was white whats wrong with that
no worries confusing use of latter and former on my part perhaps was a bit woozy myself when i wrote it
but did he actually say what this blogger is claiming no he didnt he absolutely did
well if you really feel you have to describe people who look different to you have different sexual preferences to you are not as fully able physically or mentally as you are in deliberately offensive terms go right ahead you have every right to do so i know your type im not some nasty villain thats had his insults taken away by the thought police merely fed up with the lefts pitiful attempts to inhibit free speech thank god it backfired with their disastrous policy of mass migration right to fail to show the most basic courtesy to others and are typical of that group youll be the first to complain when youre called a thick prick youve no idea what i think or who i am so i dont know where you make these assumptions from political correctness goes far beyond language just ask the people in rochdale
what are you talking about the graun and the wail are different sides of the same coin you probably think your more moral or whatever cos you happen to read a different type of bog roll
whatever the rights and wrongs of oldmans comments and the rights and wrongs are obvious lola okolosie has clearly lifted his words out of context the link to the full interview is in her article should anyone care to verify
and thats actually kind of my point if he thinks that the reason not to be antisemitic is that it might upset the jews then he doesnt understand at all sure but firstly i dont think what he said was antisemitic in the first place and secondly he has good reason not to upset the jews who run hollywood it is a fact that many who hold power there are jews but it does not matter who or what they are he cannot afford to upset them gibson can i did not read oldman simply throwing around stereotypes so since the rest of what you say which i dont disagree with is about stereotyping etc i dont regard it as particularly relevant
i dont have any power i dont have any wealth and i dont have any influence but i dont see why i cant continue to say what i damn well please as my father used to say thats what we fought hitler for
i cant actually make sense of your a are you saying that inherent abilities are an entirely natural source of inequality that we are actually born unequal and become more and more unequal as we grow
so i guess pc not a substitute for just not being a racist
i worked in the public sector for years where multiculturalism was all the rageand language was very carefully censoreddespite all of this minority groups were still underrepresented in the hierarchy which was perpetuated by managers appointing people who looked talked and acted just like themselvesstill pc language allowed the powers that be to remain smug in the illusion that they were really changing things for the betterto meactions always speak louder than words
well when youve finished despairing please do tell me how it alters my point
im not sure if i mean white guilt exactly and im not saying this encompasses all of the opposition to political correctness i was referring more to people who are desperate to believe that they are under attack from a usually leftwing authority for being white heterosexual or male there seems to be this idea that the black man the gays the women and so forth are all rising up to enslave their oppressors as revenge which transforms racism and sexism from bigotry into some kind of rebellion i might be wrong i really am just guessing i just cant think what else would explain the desire of so many majority groups most of whom have never known any kind of persecution to suddenly convince themselves that they are the new victims of persecution the alternative is that their entire experience of persecution is seeing victims of persecution getting reparations or apologies and thinking why cant i have that stuff obviously that paints them as incredibly petty on the other hand having seen religions that had no obligation to conduct samesex marriage demanding the same exemption that the cofe got makes me think that there might be a grain of truth in it some people see someone being compensated for something awful that happened to them and their first and only thought is i wish something awful had happened to me so i could get compensated gt
pinkrobbodo you think the author here should be allowed to say her opinion here or notof course doesnt mean i have to agree with it thoughif you do youre saying nothingon the contraryim saying that pc language is being used as a tool by certain groups to close down debate and badmouth the people they dont happen to agree withif you choose not to see this or accept it thats your choice but it doesnt mean it doesnt exist
i love the twisted logic here thats what youve done if youre looking to hurt someone with words then you use words which will hurt the most other than in the incorrect usage found on progressive blogs racist means thinking of as inferior or treating people differently based on their ethnicity it doesnt mean using a word which is offensive to ethnic minorities but that can still be racist if the person using it is doing so out of the belief outlined above if theyre using it just to offend then theyre an offensive arsehole but not racist its really not difficult to know the difference
completely if you fail to see why i despair
lol i do maybe i play devils advocate too much and im not saying its right but people make generalizations all the time and its not always about race can be anything where people eat what people buy where people gowe all know you cant generalize but people always will its knowing that there can never be any  truth to any blanket statement thats the difference most intelligent people realize this but its there for discussion and as we can see people will always react strongly about what theyre told they cant say think or do actually i would say that awareness that an irrational prejudice is irrational and trying to not then act on it is the way we should try to proceed most of the time we think something and then when think about that thought eg when someone is rude to us our first thought might be to punch them in the face our second thought might be that would probably be stupid our third thought might be they probably werent even aware they were being rude and so on the sense i get from the antipc brigade is that all thoughts but the first thought are communist plots to turn us into zombies or something they seem to treat the idea that they might not want to say what theyre saying if they took a second to think about it as a reason not to take a second to think about it
really and that alters my point does it
ha ha of course he knows what it is about he said it himself its about not biting the hand that feeds him and thats actually kind of my point if he thinks that the reason not to be antisemitic is that it might upset the jews then he doesnt understand at all by that logic his antisemitism is fine as long as no one tells his bosses right in reality the reason not to be antisemitic is that it is irrational the nature of stereotyping is that you take a trait eg greed and declare it to be a result of another trait eg being jewish when that trait is found in other groups eg when it turns out that funnily enough lots of gentiles arent exactly throwing their money around either this is ignored it is declared to be a product of that persons personality so in the example a greedy jewish person serves to confirm that jewish people are greedy whereas a greedy nonjewish person is just disregarded or assumed to prove that people in general are greedy it is called confirmation bias when people say some stereotypes are true they fail to understand that to some extent almost all stereotypes are true its just that theyre true of people that arent part of the stereotype as well it should be obvious to any thinking person that that is irrational and that to act on the basis of irrational prejudice is a bad idea regardless of whether anyone finds out this is the point it is not simply a case of its taboo to be antisemitic that implies that at some point someone picked a perfectly rational opinion and arbitrarily declared it to be taboo
i wonder if one day lola will actually write an article that doesnt fall apart at the seams when you scratch the surface
not sure if you know this but martin luther king was black himself
the socialist workers party disagrees with pc language their reasoning is simple being pc doesnt remove racism or sexist not from the swp it doesnt
my issue with political correctness is the hegemonic influence that certain word structures can not be said because they conflict with what is perceived to be the correct ideological view in concurrence with what bjerkeley has said political correctness is not for people who want to be offensive or who want to be racist or sexist or homophobic i think most of us would if anything prefer that racists sexists and homophobes use language as brutal and indicative of their prejudice as they wish if they feel they must express it since it makes them easier to identify and i think most of us would prefer that people who specifically want to offend should just yknow grow up and get a better hobby as bjerkeley said political correctness is not about what you cannot say as i have made clear there is no power structure enforcing it unlike the power structure that might for example oust someone from a political party for expressing a progay rights view while deciding to retain someone who expressed a deeply homophobic one the reference to hegemony suggests that you agree that political correctness is spread by people as a group agreeing that it is a good idea and doing it and people who dont do it subsequently feeling isolated from that group i wouldnt argue with that although i suspect we differ in that i think that its entirely fair since the group is entitled to decide its membership in that way the point here being political correctness does not affect people who want to be racist and dont care what anyone thinks of them and does not really try to as bjerkeley says theres a difference between what cannot be said and what one thinks should not be said racists do not think that racist things should not be said however they are phrased so political correctness cant really touch them political correctness is about enabling those who dont want to be offensive to women and minorities to avoid doing so unintentionally by creating a kind of formal approved language that all parties agree not to be offended by it effectively gives people who use outmoded racist terminology the benefit of a doubt it works to the assumption that they might have said these things because they didnt realise that they might cause offence and offers guidance on how to avoid doing it in the future that i think should make it clear that it is not some terrible hegemonic force if someone wants to be racist theyll do it either way and the best pc can do is ensure that nonracists dont feel that they have to remain silent for it and if someone is using racism purely for shock value to show how offensive they are willing to be or to show how little they care about the man see farage and co pc is more likely to teach them new terms of racial abuse than it is to inflict a correct ideological view on them really what it results in is a much starker divide between racists and nonracists it creates a clear indication of where the grey area is and how to avoid straying into it if you dont want to if that is changing culture i cannot see how it is not an improvement
the socialist workers party disagrees with pc language their reasoning is simple being pc doesnt remove racism or sexist it gives it a different wordi have to agree changing the name of something doesnt remove the problem it only reenforces the predujices of people
ive heard a lot of people of colour a lot of who
it didnt seem to stop martin luther king using it frequently but then he was obviously a racist
there are certain occupations where what you say can affect your ability to do the job actually almost all jobs are like that this is not a consequence of political correctness it was the case before and still is none of this explains why ukip defended someone for a fringe hateful homophobic view on the grounds that members were free to express personal opinions and then ousted a member from his position for expressing a personal opinion that happened to be progay rights or rather it does not explain it unless you work to the assumption that ukip wants to project an image of itself as a homophobic party which of course it did lastly godfrey blooms only crime when he referred to women as sluts was that he failed to know that the noun slut now has a different semantic meaning than the one it had when he was a child and when i was a child a slut used to mean a woman who is untidy it was roughly the female equivalent of slob yes i am well aware that slut has had another meaning in the past and that that meaning has since shifted and so was godfrey bloom call me a pc thug but i cannot accept this lame excuse the old may be out of touch but they are not time travellers arriving in the present day from the s without having lived the intervening  years for basically all of godfrey blooms life british culture has been moving towards equality for women and a greater respect for them as something other than domestic servants in order to maintain the attitudes of the s bloom has to have lived through all of that and yet remained unmoved by it if anything i would say that he has less excuse for his sexism than someone born in the past  years because unlike a  year old now he has firsthand experience of an institutionally sexist system as well as a more egalitarian one
if he thinks its just about taboo words then hes an idiot who doesnt even understand why hes apologising ha ha of course he knows what it is about he said it himself its about not biting the hand that feeds him
lol i do maybe i play devils advocate too much and im not saying its right but people make generalizations all the time and its not always about race can be anything where people eat what people buy where people gowe all know you cant generalize but people always will its knowing that there can never be any  truth to any blanket statement thats the difference most intelligent people realize this but its there for discussion and as we can see people will always react strongly about what theyre told they cant say think or do
that its ok or acceptable in certain circumstancescontexts to act out the tropes of any isms this is the whole point of the polemic here that it should never be alright just how selfreflexive is it to complain about isms while attributing a default mode with negative linguistic assumptions to an entire social group especially when that group is defined and limited by gender and ethnicity even lola is at it it has become banal and even tyrannical to try to argue for language and behaviour that respects women and minorities it is tyrannical because people should be arguing for language and behaviour that respects everybody not just those groups who you favour or as it appears in your case excluding those that you dont
i am not really sure that i understand your objection perhaps you could give some examples of those four factors interrelating so that for example the process goes realitygtlanguagegtactiongtthought or whatever obviously i dont expect one for every permutation but still im struggling to see the objection to the idea that language influences thought theres a pretty substantial body of research that indicates that thoughts are limited by what we have words to describe and that people associate the verbal with the visual very readily from personal experience ive encountered people using words in ways that make little sense in terms of their meaning eg claiming that someone looks like an immigrant or is of muslim appearance but which make a kind of sense when you acknowledge that the context that they most often see the word associates it with an image you declare this an arrogant assumption but in fact it is not an assumption at all it is something that i immediately had trouble with but came to recognise as making sense as a result of reading studies that amassed evidence of it thats sort of the opposite of an assumption
you want table  by the way will you at least admit that its nonsense to say to an almost statistical certainty all murderers can be assumed to be male
whothe dictionary writers or those political correct puritans 
the oed records and reports usage it is descriptive not proscriptive the pc nit twit thought police are something much more sinister they tell you what you may and may not think and say and which realities you may perceive and which not sick
have you got as list of all murderers in history shall we start somewher more quantifiable modern british crime statistics somewhere between  and  of your randomly selected  murderers would be female so to say it is a statistical certainty that they would be male is simply not true i actually ed a definition of shrill high pitched and piercing in another comment in the interests of fairness it was the very first result for shrill definition no one is sating most women have shrill voices but if  individuals who had high pitched and shrill voices were selected at random do you think most of them would be male or female so why is it sexist and dumb to use a female pronoun in a sentence about being shrill or being a professional nurse or doing housework if youre happy with using a male pronoun in a sentence about being a murderer
here have a tissue for those flecks forming at the side of your mouth dear 
its not another dictionary completely its a derivative of the oed in fact all dictionaries work in this way recording usage its just oxford does it best if a term isnt used in this way a dictionary has no place to define it feminism is just an ideology to which people subscribe with varying degrees of enthusiasm it is no more inherently right for being feminism than is christianity for being christianity socialism for being socialism veganism for being veganism or antieu for being antieu none of these deserves special protected status though its typical for adherents who subscribe strongly to any of these or other ideologies that they should be protected a point about this type of ideology that speaks for itself
patriarchy informs our language amp culture as everything is all about males when without us wombs they wouldnt exist how did the imbalance continue oh i know males dominated politics amp ritual women were to hang around feed the herd procreate amp be silent enough i was really dismayed to hear adam rutherford on the subject of species on the infinite monkey cage topic racism last week say genus homo means man species sapien means wise he was miffed that i pointed out that a modern scientist using correct terminology would refer to us as sapiens btw race doesnt exist so would people stop using that as an excuse for anything language evolves as we do and every literate person can make the effort to use inclusive or even gender neutral language
i remember how the lesbians were pretending that womens loving men were not real feminists kind of but we might show them the way  type of patronising arrogance could have not been more of the same type of macho crap talk it ended with lots of women leaving the movement what does not prevent from fighting for the human rights of all
yes like bitching about women below the line of any graun article about feminism apparently
im not sure how the oed incorporates the usemention distinction into their usage examples but yeah that could become an issue let me get this straight youre not entirely certain as to the lexicographical methods they use but yet youre absolutely positive that their methods ought not lead them to rabid feminist
how about native language to solve that problem now back to the fray
theyll move onto tumblr
political correctness over objective observation should disqualify oman for his phd
except rabid feminist isnt the most common usage of metaphorical rabid so you cant really use that excuse but it is a reasonably common usage i doubt they select the most common every time
i have a nagging doubt that the word is mostly used about women
why does the oxford dictionary of english portray women as rabid feminists with mysterious psyches speaking in shrill voices who cant do research or hold a phd but can do all the housework it doesnt portray anyone as anything these are examples of usage not portrayals let alone prescriptions and the phrases cherrypicked by mr omanreagan are entirely unrepresentative of the oed as a whole which obviously uses both masculine and feminine examples rabid c of a person having a particular opinion outlook or enthusiasm in an extreme or fanatical form  c lamb christs hosp in elia  b was a rabid pedant r w emerson ess nd ser viii  the rabid democrat as soon as he is senator and rich man etc e lyall we two i xiii  he is very rabid on the subject m twain puddnhead wilson viii  she was a more rabid and devoted methodist than ever life  july  caption a rabid antijapanese is col chen lukteh of the th army of north china amer home jan  a californian once bitten becomes as rabid a glass collector as any native of sandwich who may have inherited the malady from her grandmother a oakley taking it like woman   perhaps the entire staff of the school were rabid feminists but if so we did not know and we certainly werent r m davis midlands viii  my mother was a little rabid on the distinction but her attitude was extreme not unique cult times feb  a lot of people who are now rabid fans didnt actually see the first episodes because it took two or three years to catch on also has mr omanreagan realised that the rabid feminists phrase comes from a book by ann oakley distinguished british sociologist feminist and writer
so in the choices made perhaps they can choose examples that dont reinforce negative stereotypes i think it would help to put yourself in the shoes of a dictionary and think about what it is trying to do it is trying to reflect the language as used if you are trying to reflect the language as used then any other criteria for the selection of phrases such as whether they might reinforce stereotypes will cut across your primary purpose they complicate your process and they make the dictionary weaker in its primary function they can change this example because in this case there are more commonly used examples that illustrate the point fairly well but that wont be the case always and it isnt a step that they should add as a formal part of their process the language is what it is warts and all the dictionary should be painting an honest portrait
not sure ive heard nagging in that context before a nagging doubt though
and on and on and on
dont change your dictionary too soon the spokesman had a point here are two examples of nonnegative use of rabid jack matthews a confessed rabid bibliophile author teacher collector and nationallyknown literary critic offers a fascinating collection of twelve personal essays about book collecting he had been a minstrel a signpainter a vagabond a scrub reporter a lawyer a rabid reader of novels and a clever imitator of old poets
apparently its very strange how many people on this thread and elsewhere seem to be hoppingly furious at the idea that a dictionary might update its sample definitions to reflect usage which is what dictionaries do all the time unless they cease publishing
it depends how and why i think charlotte proudman experienced quite a backlash for her tactics
uh but in this instance we are talking about examples of how a word is used and not the historical uses of a word therefore the oed needs to be more careful to avoid sexism and racism in its examples its not difficult to do particularly for those who work with words so they should only aim for objective accuracy in the case of words amp usages that are judged to be safely historical in the case of current usage objective standards ought to be dropped in favour of the subjective how do i feel standards that are all the rage amongst the ideological hacks of our age my goodness the proposals are becoming progressively more bizarre amp detached from reality did i just accidentally wander into a student union meeting or the likes
nobodys saying you cant use male or female pronouns or that definitions should be genderneutral but they are basically saying that there cant be any use of women to illustrate negative sentences because if there are theyll cherrypick them and complain about them
like being free from oppression and the stink of an inherent sexist attitude that seeps into every aspect of our society
no one has to be a man
im sure if it had said rabid conservative or rabid anarchist nobody would even have noticed but feminism is an ideology and people do get quite easily outraged on the twitter where there seems to be a storm every day
true dat
during this a child under  dies of malnutrition each  seconds i hear how they love their distraction obsessions 
so its not a real problem then but a bunch of idiots on twitter moaning as usual
to be fair he does sound like a sanctimonious moron if you have a look at his twitter im guessing harassment was basically criticism and some rude words feminists and sjws love to dish it out but cant take it
hows about a rabid monarchist would that work 
certainly the people who spent their weekend harassing michael omanreagan online seemed to be very upset about something
these articles do bring out a load of rabid misogynists
i cant wait for twitter to go bust then what will all the barmy sjws do with their time itll be back to writing letters to the editor in green biro
i knoweveryone knows rabid goes with right winger and nursing can still only be done by women in one sense of the word these dictionary compilers and publishers are very dangerous and evil people and anyone striking a blow against them are heroes bravely advancing the cause of women with no regard to the risk to their own safety on or off the twitter we owe them so much for making the world a truly better place
our great postwar reformist clem attlee was heard to say of a parliamentary colleague hes a socialist of course whereupon mrs attlee chipped in but not a rabid one darling
if the more extreme end of feminists werent trying to get more rights than men and be given a more advantageous position of sorts over men which they typically do in many areas custody of children divorce settlements lighter sentencing for equal crimes as just some examples under the cloak of equality and actually argued for true equality between sexes id support them  as they stand from all i have seen and read from famous feminists that isnt foremost on their agenda and some things theyve said on record could be attributed to outright hatred for anyone with a penis even if theyre a nice guy who treats their partner with respect and equalitytrying to remove the word rabid which describes some of the more extreme feminists quite poetically is laughable its on par with men demanding the removal of the phrase manhating or the reference of typically by men in the oed definition of rape the feminists would be in uproar change the name to equalism even the name feminism suggests bias towards femaleshttpawomanagainstfeminismblogspotcouk
but are they truly feminists
the end of the specienice this time of the year 
well yes
we should assume that the dictionary monitors english language usage and selected an example that was normal that is what dictionaries do i think weve all heard the phrase rabid feminist before so we cant accuse them of making it up or selecting something offbeat if other usages are now more common then obviously its fine to change it but its hardly outrageous if there has been a lag in updating the example what would be entirely wrong would be to select examples on the basis of how appropriate they are rather than on whether they reflect common usage that approach would undermine the whole point of a dictionary and the most important thing for the dictionary here is to maintain the integrity of the process the appropriateness of the phrase isnt even a consideration
how to call political correct zealots pretending to be feminists in the right way i just thought something very mean and angry but hey dont say what you think in a manner despotism
buzzfeed are the jeremy kyle of internet news
twatter sturm and drang for apprentice presidents armchair miso jeanists
what about it she was not convicted of rape since it would be impossible for a woman just as i said
what do the militant feminists think of the phrase rabid dog ie a dog who has rabiesare they offended
how does one get to be a canadian anthropologist yet still need to look up the word rabid in a dictionary or did the page just open there by chance 
i can understand that some examples might be stereyotyping but buzzfeed uncovered further gendered definitions with usage for the word nurse including he was gradually nursed back to health seems to indicate that they are objecting to all use of male or female examples in all circumstances
why dont you look up meanings and usage of the words affect and effect in a dictionary of your choice
how about going through the  definitions in the oed and seeing how many can be interpreted as sexist are the above examples all they could find in half a million definitions
mail hysteria hyman capplan
im hardpushed to think of a way to demonstrate the use of an adjective used as a hyperbolic intensifier denoting negative connotation which doesnt portray a negative stereotype the very point of the adjective rabid in this sense is to portray a negative stereotype any other dictionary definition would be misleading
what is wrong with call out culture
the most depressing part of this story is thisbut as rabid became the most popular search term on its site over the weekend and as omanreagan found himself deluged with harassment online academic contacts publisher to take issue with a point of linguistics idiots give him an online kicking oh the joys of the internet
quite a minefield it could be argued that rabid hehe feminists have successfully fought for the virtual extinction of the feminine form actress to be completely replaced by the male form actor regardless of the gender of the performer dont get me started on the inanimateneutered use of chair
i never thought id say this but definitely a case of pc gone mad 
i love that so effing right
do people these days actually go out of their way to look for things to get upset about
meanwhile in the realitybased world people understand that language influences how we think and serves to reinforce stereotypes which stereotype do you think is being reinforced by the dictionary
i tend to find the most rabid feminists are men and no of course the phrase isnt sexist reminds me of another phrase feminist logic
be carefully it is notoriously difficult to accurately arrive at such a diagnosis
surely we are at the point now where feminists getting offended by something on twitter is no longer newsworthy
or how about shrill httpsbooksgooglecomngramsgraphcontentshrillwomancshrillmanampyear_startampyear_endampcorpusampsmoothingampshareampdirect_urltbcshrillwomanbccbtbcshrillmanbcc
the whole point of a dictionary is to record the laguage as it is used and not to manipulate it into some politically correct box
because to many yourself included any small change or incremental improvement suggested or requested to counter the centuries of stereotyping of women as inferior humans is considered to be rabid feminism when in fact its not its simply part of a slow but inevitable process of change to restore the perception of women world wide as fully human if youre not keen on the idea you can just ignore it and go watch the footie
hmmm it seems rabid invariably applies to a dog in common usage never a bitch sexist much p
i had a friend who got killed trying to take a selfie in a twitterstorm i miss him a lot lt
is that the same caring feminist who stated it wont not unless men get their act together have their power taken from them and behave themselves i mean i would actually put them all in some kind of camp where they can all drive around in quad bikes or bicycles or white vans i hope heterosexuality doesnt survive actually i would like to see a truce on heterosexuality i would like an amnesty on heterosexuality until we have sorted ourselves out because under patriarchy its shit and i am sick of hearing from individual women that their men are all right those men have been shored up by the advantages of patriarchy and they are complacent they are not stopping other men from being shit i would love to see a womens liberation that results in women turning away from men and saying when you come back as human beings then we might look again indeed a very frothy comment
i guess the point would be that everyday usage is changing i mean if it is the case that _every_ traditionally mostly male activity uses a male pronoun as an example and every traditionally female one uses a female pronoun even though today those activities are far less exclusive to one sex than they used to be then one could argue the dictionary is not keeping up with reality no its a question of proportions i suppose not individual examples
i dont get it people keep saying that the oed need to reflect todays language so as to be relevent but im not convinced there are many ways to define a word without making it particularly gender specific but still be relevent housework tasks that are undertaken to maintain a home eg cleaning washing ironing and so on where there are words that do have a gender signifier they can be defined quite easily in non derogatory ways its so easy to work out it makes me wonder what qualifications a person needs to get a job defining words in the oed
tautology
agreed rabid tory is far more common
the article isnt about the oed at all its about another dictionary completely
did you read what i wrote or just a bit of it statistically if you randomly selected  murderes from the list of all murderers in history approximately  of them would be men shrill is not high pitched not that most women i know even have high pitched voices it is shrill an unpleasant pearcing stab to the eardrums i dont understand your last question sorry

the article is not about the oed it is about a different dictionary which is fir contemporary usage only

how many countries have you lvied in seriously i know people in spain whod consider anyone even slightly to the right of say franco to be a rabid bolshevik hellbent on bayoneting nuns in the town plazas and i wouldnt place the political centre of spanish politics particularly to the left of the uks despite the rise of podemos but see also the rise of ciudadanos and the fact that the pp actually won the election despite all the scandals you need to get out more

matthew my point is give your own imagery some thought dont passively accept what is thrust upon you
yes its neither always deletrious to women nor is it only negative towards women its never hidden as usual the graun employs blunt stupidity in writing an article because its easy to appeal to the graun faithful than the more challenging and society supporting balanced argument with a proper historical reflection and analysis of modern usage no wonder private eye takes the piss out of the company and those btl
there are plenty of words used to describe men that are somewhat worse than these words that have all but fallen out of usage indeed so much worse and so offensive are these words that although they were almost all still in use an attempt to list a few of them got modded so im wondering what this says about our language

why i have no idea what you ate referring to never heard the word spoken here
the word denigration was used in this article that refers to calling negro or nigger to someone in order to insult this is also wrong
oh how true this article is but has the writer only just caught up with what feminists have been saying since the early  s dale spender for one good that he has written this for many to see perhaps worth referencing the many women who have pointed it out before sexism in language goes way beyond these few words
kipper is someone that enjoys an afternoon nap
no the point is that negative words used to refer to men still infer their greater power while negative words used against women denote their lack of power and status men are only pretending to be bothered all of a sudden by less than complimentary words associated with them because they want to shut women up trying to draw a parallel where there is none
how many women were governor of a province in the th century i dont know why dont you do some reading and find out as a form of address for a woman it is archaic that was sort of the point
i just meant that it is a strange word to target in terms of equality and it has a whole entry in the guardian style guide since in acting generally gender discrimination is kind of necessary
is it my understanding that the guardian is now paying its commentators to go through the oxford dictionary to look for terms that insult women no if youd read the article you would have noticed a link to another article that reports on a controversy begun by an academic male anthropologist who accused oup of sexism this article explores the issue further for those who are interested not overly defensive men like yourself
talk so let your language reflect your attitudes ok not too hard is it
how many women were governor of a province in the th century it was used as the female form of a person in charge of an institution such as a school or in charge of the education of the children of the wealthy it is now occasionally used by a male to address a male slightly higher on the social scale especially tv shows hello guv as a form of address for a woman it is archaic a female governor general will not be a governoressgeneral likewise a female president is not a presidentess and a female prime minister is not a prime ministeress
im missing your point im just describing my own imagery thrust upon me by a harsh male orientated world
no the meaning of english words is decided by a shadowy group of men that meet once a year with the express intention of keeping down women
what is that general commonplace what this article is about i thought it was about  words that were very vexatious to women and hence sexist
surely to demonstrate that there is something sexist about words changing their meaning you have to at least show how and why meanings change not just the fact that they do for instance the only times ive heard words like hussy and madam being used it has almost always been women talking disparagingly about other women as in shes a proper little hussy etc anecdotal evidence i know but it seems at least plausible to me that words change their meaning because language communities contain disparate social groups divided along the lines of gender class age etc that drive changes according to their own usages which eventually become mainstream if that is true and if women were really involved in how words for women changed then that is hardly sexism

bob you are overcomplicating men see shafting a woman as an example of their male power whoaah look at me this woman now belongs to me thats what macho is all about that kind of man should be obsolete by now but isnt slow to catch on lesser intelligence
of course being an older gentleman who still has sex drive i am at least a dirty old man and probably a paedophile if i have sex with a much younger woman so that i am reduced to being a wanker or a tosser redneck bogans like me who like beer are hooligans according to the fairer sex suspicious looks abound if i am seen cuddling a female granddaughter
so lets get this straight if language shapes belief we can conclude that the middle ages were far more enlightened when it came to gender equality and the change in usage indicates that things have gone downhill ever since and continue to do so good ole times eh
if they comment on the stupidity of the thesis then there is hope still
what a load of bs why do you have a strong argument to counter the position that sexism is ingrained into societys norms and structures often hidden yet always deleterious to women
would it not be the case that if some of these negative words were associated with females you would then be complaining that it was an unfair characterisation of women its hard to win no
not really never heard bitch for a man although ive heard talk of men who are bitchy slag for a man sounds very cockney to me never heard it outside television
so this was a feminism for men  assignment
i wonder why the one term of abuse that is based solely on the mans actual personal behaviour alludes to a lack of sexual contact with women whereas the abusive terms that are thrown at women refer to their sexual conduct with men

try describe women more negatively thats the point and thats the so what
well since language tends to reflect a general mindset it might be nice to think that challenging certain harmful concepts might lead to an evolution of language rather than simply eliminating words and definitions out of the dictionary
ive never heard girlyman but at a guess it is insulting a man for being like a woman isnt it more insulting to women then a woman can be a misogynist as well

the comments below can serve as an extension of this article
er because the writer is being pedantic try googling madam and madame
peasant is often used as an insult as well urban have always considered themselves more civilised
will the author now pen an article about islam and its attitude to women dont sugar coat it no need to go back to c loads of modern day case studies would suffice come on just do it
not antimuslim just a language that our david is familiar with
only heard it once to describe a man and he was gay
only men who are fed up on admitting their own privileged existence
surely its simply sexism that is being challenged rather than being a specific criticism of the english language or any other language
i just went to google and typed rabid and the first suggestion that popped up was dog not feminist rabid f brings up fox film and fan rabid fe suggests ferret fever and third feminist
your point would be relevant if you listed examples of common changes in meaning that were pejorative to men
obviouslyim sure david would acknowledge that patriarchies dont only exist in the west
does the author not understand that english is fluid and subtle when written mistress was abbreviated to mrs and then it was eventually pronounced as it was written this then left the meaning as the woman in charge of a household apart from the connotation of being a kept woman the word continues to have positive strong connotations she is mistress of her domain it can also indicate a woman who dominates a male in a sexual relationship madam has also been superseded by mrs and then ms while it now indicates the mistress of a household that is a brothel it still exists as a widespread polite form of address for women generally can i help you madam for women in the usa especially the south can i help you maam for the queen of the uk yes maam no maam composing letters or emails dear sir or madam is it too much to expect that when writing about the meanings of words the author opens a dictionary or the guardian employs a linguist dictionarycom mistressdictionarycom mrsdictionarycom madam
and its still going on and so still needs to be challenged if you had really learned anything you might realise that
oh dear how dare she break the rules in such a way

whenever i read this kind of article i cant help but chuckle as i cast my eyes to the bottom of the page and see a banner asking me to donate  per month to help maintain the high quality standard of fearless and independent journalism for which the guardian is so renowned
matthew women should invent and use equally dismissive terms for men we can easily but what would that achieve maybe a lot maybe not but since all those terms are historic and unreflective of today who the hell uses them those who have not got with the present probably
these eight words are examples yes but eight examples dont make a case the author mentions this happens more for female descriptive words than male descriptive words but doesnt go into any more detail than that ie how many words describing women have undergone this change compared to male descriptive words this is not to say i dont necessarily agree that the point is true just that im not going to take the authors word for it when no comparative evidence is provided
horse is both masculine and feminine and we have many words to be more specific eg stallion mare have you eaten alewife freshwater kind or sea kind interesting name
theyre not all but even so they tend to still imply a sense of power
my reaction was goes the weaselgod knows what that says about me
yes spanish can be really awful i always wince when people refer to mi mujer i know it means my wife but as mujer also means woman it feels sowrong and thats before we get to the esposa definition wifehandcuffs
the last time i saw as stupid an argument was by a bunch oops am i allowed to use that word now of evangelical types bemoaning that the word gay had come to describe homosexuals is it my understanding that the guardian is now paying its commentators to go through the oxford dictionary to look for terms that insult women is this a serious pursuit now that the prince charles spider lights which the guardian wasted considerable amounts of money mainly taxpayers looking for evidence of the evil princes vile influence i can just see the editorial meeting now we are so awfully david but we used up far too much money in the last few quarters pursuing charlie windsor so we cant give you any money for your deep investigation into corruption of conservative councils but dont despair heres the latest dictionary go look for offensive words oh and could we get twenty quid for the dictionary
depressing and also rather fascinating to learn the original meaning of these words there were a couple i wasnt aware of always great to see a man writing something in defense of women thank you
interesting
food for thought what about the female equivalent of philanderer which is not necessarily considered to be derogatory in contrast to the closest female equivalent whore or slut

an insult still based on insulting women
the grammatical gender of a word has no strong relation to biological gender the german word for girl is not feminine for example often it just relates to whatever suffix is used in complex nouns

wonderful i am quite happy about the oed being at home with the most nonsexist word unmarried this word means the same for men and women yet to be married only i want to know why the word is not in the same class as uncovered unravelled unchanged unmitigated etc why does the word unmarried not mean a person already married but for some reason come out of that bondage obviously the two words bachelor and bachelorette if you will do not meet the requirements of a proper expression 
i think sound in general might be sexist
they need to demonstrate the figurative use also
thats not even nearly true there are plenty of male specific insults i could list some but it might get removed
let me get this straight language changes over time and some words get describe people more negatively so what
or italian
thank you too

what a load of bs how many articles will the graun need to publish before its accepted that its become a childs comicsorry thats an insult to childrens comics
db
wow amazing knee jerk reactions in the comments to a fairly well made point in the article and its not exactly earth shattering is it the idea that language shapes belief that calling people narrow minded men cocks can be construed as offensive 
fascinating
im disappointed that there is no mention of how words are hijacked back in the s it was the republicans that were referenced as progressives more recently the democrats have liked the term so well that they have hijacked it to refer to themselvesand their destructive efforts to socially engineer our society with subsidies that destroy the incentive for people the poor to make efforts in their own behalf
would calling you a complete cause harm im sure there are things which you would take offence at being called words have emotional impact as they are an indication of how someone else sees you and what their intentions towards you are im not really sure how you can deny that other peoples views of you and their intentions towards you because of that will have emotional impact
ive given this sexist language thing another thought mind you hardly anyone finds it a sexist language offense if women refer to nasty mean or intolerant men by a derogatory phallic term that rhymes with trick on the other hand if men were to use the degrogatory term for female genitalia that rhymes with bunt there is a great hue and cry the one exception to this rule is whenever someone especially a leftist of any gender uses the term to describe maggie thatcher some people might also be ok with someone using that term to describe sarah palin or bernadette devlin its all a bit tricky
well at least we still have knob if thats any consolation but i see your point
this piece is silly it merely serves to demonstrate that terms about the opposite sex as well as about everything else change in meaningeg wicked amp awesome most recently
i follow the intent of this article but got stuck on an apparent comedic elementmy reaction to pop was father in that i am not normative so it seemsand then as if to turn the screw my reaction to the last word example was a simple collocation pop tarteither i am not sexist of just hungry
i have been aware of the misogynist terms of the english language since i was old enough to read and i believe the majority of women have already figured it out as well
mate whats your problem you seem to be straight up avoiding the issue the point was made was it not 
my impression is that this article was contributed by a writer who is not a scholar of etymology or lexicography or even someone with a basic grounding in linguistic scienceyou cannot reveal any general truths about a language with a lexis of over  words by looking at only  wordsalso it is impossible to find etymological sexism of this kind in chinese and the same applies to chinese syntax but to say that chinese women have always been treated as equals to men in chinese society is clearly nonsense
and now theyre not in part because the guardian has started calling actresses actors thereby compensating for all previous sexism in the english language
spinster is still used in the us in legal documents examples contract for buying a house closing records or taking out a loan
i remember that sun headline turning on frank bruno like that was a horrible thing to do and for once they really misjudged their readers
i have heard this before well done for saying aloud what most sufferers try to keep quiet you feel so so good but in case anybody loses sympathy for bi polar people who tend to cause a lot of suffering to those around them there is another side to it hence the name
i think its a bit strange that some organisations have media advisory services but wont get involved in individual cases of discrimination maybe they should put more energy into a legal advisory service for people who have noone else to turn to maybe that would be of more benefit to the people actually suffering humiliation and harassment on a daily basis
schizophrenic has to be one of the most misunderstood and misappropriated words in this sphere it seems to have become shorthand for opposite or split in some sense or even if used in relation to mental health usually appropriated to multiple personality disorder a very rare condition much more common unfortunately is schizophrenia where suffers experience delusions and hallucinations often unpleasant and extremely fearful ones nothing at all to do with split personality or opposites of any kind
absolutely it is the practice of establishing and maintaining the other that enables the tabloid press to keep their popularity distancing and labelling of the groups which scare us help to make us feel safe as a group it is so very basic tribal warmongering that it is a wonder anybody in the whole of humanity buys it let alone those in our relatively welleducated islands hopefully soon it will become so apparent that we are all other the lazy habit will end
isnt reading the sun constitute a mental health problem
im pretty sure most of this stems from womens magazines and daytime tv the pernicious pop psychology influence it also seems to spread out into bullshit phrases such as commitmentphobia which could be applied to an aromantic someone who is content with the present situation someone who simply doesnt want to commit right now or with you etc the rationale behind this is in itself somewhat narcissistic in that it transfers all the blame for failure on to the other rather than risking any narcissistic injury to the ultimately fragile idealised self have to say though the worst abuse of terminology is the confusion of psychotic and psychopathic big difference
while i agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment of your article i am afraid that your use of the term mental health illness is well completely bonkers mental illness is by definition disease of the mind mental health is by definition the absence of disease of the mind so what is mental health illness a disease of the absence of disease of the mind which is political correctness incorrectness gone mad if youll excuse the expression surely it makes more sense to challenge the stigma attached to mental illness than to resort to such tortured grammatical constructs in your attempts to spare the feelings of those who suffer from it
nightingale identifies schizophrenic as being continually misapplied id also add psycho to that unfortunately the vernacular appears to refer to those suffering psychosis as well as psychopathy you dont need to be a consultant psychiatrist to know that these are wildly different things ill be very surprised the day psycho is used to mean critically distorted perceptions leading to profound social vulnerability distress and loss of function rather than popular shorthand for mad axeman
quite a few of the admissions to mental hospitals ive met can be quite dismissive of other patients with more severe symptoms one tried to explain to me that he shouldnt be in a loony bin after having made an unsuccessful suicide attempt a few days earlier and was quite contemptuous and mocking of many of the more obviously psychotic patients the stigmatization is clearly highly internalized and projects externally
as much as anything else i dislike the way medical or psychiatric terminology is now bandied around by people who would be hard put to define it or indeed even recognise the syndromes they are so quick to identify in others im thinking of she is a bit schizophrenicbipolar when they mean unpredictablechangeable in their moods or she is a narcissist meaning anything at all from unduly preoccupied with their looks to doesnt pay me enough attention and dont start me on sociopath everyone is a sociopath nowadays in fact i might be one myself 
much like some businessescouncilsnhs trusts banning the word brainstorms and using thoughtshower instead as they believe it might be offensive to people with epilepsy the fact that the epilepsy society as a bear called brainstorm the bear shows they have a sense of humour there are very few things i find offensive one is someone assuming they can take offensive on someone elses behalf
the example of the australian psychological societys objection to the term commiting suicide is a good example of the point at which showing basic decency transforms into selfdefeating political correctness if one analyses the term closely enough one can say it has religious or legal connotations but who actually uses it that way all words have historical associations but i can honestly say that ive never heard the phrase commiting suicide used in an offensive manner or met anyone who was offended by it indeed it never even occurred to me that it could be construed as offensive until i read this article if one looks to be offended one inevitably will be
she added changing language alone is only dealing with the stigma on a superficial level and not uncovering the causes of such language even worse faffing about policing peoples language is like arranging deckchairs on the titanic while the government is hammering people with disabilities and health conditions of all kinds
its a grey area however mostly the people who complain most are those who want to use clearly unacceptable language on a regular basis the bonkers bruno headline is just wrong for example and its amazing how anyone thought that was appropriate
its about context isnt it most of us use different language for different contexts i may refer to someone whose ideas political or religious i find extreme and absurd as loopy a loon or a nutjob but i do not use those words to refer to people i know who genuinely have depression or bipolar disorder if anything the more frivolous words have shifted to the extent that they are not generally used about people with real mental health problems but only in a more bantering context the spastics society rebranded in  some older people were proud to be spastic but ultimately it was costing the charity precious donations was it really costing them donations one of my closest friends not an older person was not pleased with the name change because the original word described her condition accurately scope could mean anything and im sure a lot of people popping into their shops have no idea what it stands for
also ocd used to describe people who are neat and tidy and a bit anal about liking their cds in the right order eg the straightening the doorknocker scene in sherlock hes ocd he doesnt even notice hes doing it er someone with ocd most definitely would notice they were doing it theyd get acutely distressed about the doorknocker out of place if that was their particular obsession thats the whole point i dont find this offensive but like the misuse of schizophrenic it does give laypersons a totally misleading idea of what the condition actually is i have ocd and my house is a total mess ive actually had ignorant friends querying my diagnosis on this basis
how about the sun thinks people gives a fuck about their childish opinions to be fair its not just the birdcage papers that perpetuates wrong attitudes in the workplace and society about mental health like a broken arm or stab wound there are many different types of afflictions on a theme so it pays to teach and learn about triggers understanding and help rather than seek a cure everyone is affected by some sort of personal issue of the mind at some point of their life its not as if its a taboo i also have to say that the guardian has come up with some though provoking articles about mental health over the last few months which can only be a good thing
words and phrases are taboo because of the historical anxiety around the subject in question sexual swearwords used to be the worst because we have been historically anxious about sexracial swearwords are now considered the worst because we are anxious about racial equalitymental illness swearwords you get the picture i look forward to a day when people can use swearwords of any type without concern for the stigma attached because sex race and mental illness will not be stigmatised this can only happen when we as a society have truly come to terms with our historical and cultural anxieties
generally its normally clear from the context whether somebody is being genuinely offensivecallous or just a bit behind the curve hopefully if people are nice respectful and not intrusive then we should forgive some oldfashionedness in their choice of words however nice respectful and not intrusive are unlikely to be applied to the news media i know it was over a decade ago but why was frank brunos health problems reported let alone on a front page as well as policing language editors should also strive for nonsensational handling of these issues including shock horror not reporting on something not reporting also includes avoiding articles complaining about crass coverage in the daily mail or on twitter
i suffer from bipolar disorder and ive had every kind of word relating to madness thrown at me from crazy to nutjob but hey it dont bother me because its all in the context and tone my best friend likes to rib me by doing dodgy spike milligan impressions so who is really the crazy one lol i can understand that some folks who also suffer from said mental illnesses may not find it amusing or water off a ducks back but thats a cross we have to bear i suppose everybody has one live and let live and most of all try to be happy coz when im high im high baby i feel crazy just writing this post god damn disorder lol everybody should be bi polar for a day i highly recommend it
people do not understand mental health problems and are therefore scared of them they use this kind of language to deflect their own fears we really do need to make people aware of the complexities and let them know this kind of language doesnt help
consideration for others in language and in deed is sorely lacking in this modern self reliant individualistic age words do hurt we all need to be sensitive in an empathic scense to others the cold responses of those who complain about political correctness or language police really need to learn and understand what it is like being in the other persons position but then that empathy doesnt seem to exist amongst my narcissistic friends a trait thats increasing im finding in all things love as a famous st paul e alludes to
language is difficult to police because taking offence is such a subjective experience as someone who has struggled with depression for many many years including concomitant prejudice from otherwise enlightened people i can honestly say that being called mental or nutter is the least of my worries its actually kind of amusing
its tricky dont ever want to find society in a position where we can use that word but you cant as you say mental and mad and numerous others i and those close to me will frequently use in context and with compassion its also impossible to avoid offending everybody and ultimately one shouldnt feel the need to tiptoe but i think everyone has the capacity to empathise to the extent that the context and compassion behind a statement can be assessed the whole mental patient halloween costume thing that flared last year was deeply deeply offensive and disruptively upsetting yet those around me even mental health workers will refer to mental moments or a bit of a mad episode with perfect clarity with compassion for the person and with appropriate disdain for the illness because these things can be horrible illnesses and they are worthy of disdain just not the person suffering them as a journalistic guide all i might suggest is how will a quarter of my readers respond to this
it seems entirely reasonable not to use words that tick people off it takes no effort it takes a lot of energy to work up a good lather on political correctness gone mad in which lazy conservatives love to loll

the thing is for the first several thousand years of the word man meant human adult woman is relatively late addition to the game wifman plural wifmen wif being a woman wife didnt mean married the male equivalent was wer the loss of wifman and werman is a sad loss for english poetry the only recent attempt i can find to reclaim man to relate fully to humanity is grrm in game of thrones i am the shield that guards the realms of men he says to the maester of castle black and uses it to save the very lovely gilly man doesnt mean blokes alone and wifmen and wermen should unite on this
noone is arguing that there should not be a gender neutral word to describe a person where the gender is irrelevant just as in the s many women including me adopted the term ms to clarify that whether or not we were married was irrelevant to our status as female i still use the termthey refers to a plural including plural men women dogs cats or insects take your pick it is simply grammatically incorrect to use it when referring to an individual of either genderlets find a new word make it a competition if you like but please do not misappropriate words because you are afraid to offend the sensibilities of a woman or a man believe me it causes more offence to crucify our language
it feels weird because it is forced betraying the authors all conscious political intentions i felt like i was being manipulated
englishenglishenglish engli she nglis he ngli she ngl is he ngli she nglitheynglithey 
great article ideology is always perpetuated without intention thats how it works
that is kind of my point the english language is so masculinised that anything written in the female seems weird and unnatural as a female im not comfortable with that
im so sorry now i vandalized his name like a bull in the china shop now before you strangle me i have to clarify that i literally mean heshe he slash she or hisher his slash her thats what i dont like to write and thats what shakespeare never wrote sorry for any confusion that might have caused
so no new word they has always existed to refer to any individual without denoting gender
what another load of absolute bollocks by the millennial special snowflake brigade if i dont use they am i triggering someone i do hope so
so does she she is s superset which is only fitting since he comes out of she
no problem address the salutation as dear shanice or deshawn ie just use their name first and last without the mrmsmrs
first they came for the word actress 
but they contains the word he so isnt that also oppressively patriarchal
i hate you people who think we should talk about mass unemployment and globalisation when we should really be talking about the threat to the planet of global warming
they love their neighbours they love their wives whose wives do they love their wives and their neighbours wives the wives love their neighbours too they love their husbands whose husbands their neighbours husbands is the argument in favour of using they as third person gender neutral pronoun gets reinforced as a singular 
i think its a reasonable word to use in some circumstances i might say the patient hurt himself the patient hurt herself the patient hurt themself the patients hurt themselves
what i meant was that in general if the flatmate is a woman youd say she and if a man he i suppose the flatmate might be someone who didnt want to be referred to by either of those words in which case linguistic difficulties arise and for my sentence they might be a useful compromise but it would cause big problems in other sentences you couldnt really say how did your flatmate and your parents get on i hope they didnt hurl abuse at them such a flatmate though would presumably not wish to be referred either to by some single invented pronoun that covered men and women i was really objecting to those who take the they thing too far into sentences where its not appropriate and sounds silly as when you say they to refer to your flatmate whose sex you know i once got a message saying ive asked one of my coeditors and they think and i wondered who they referred to and then was irritated that the person hadnt said he or she whichever was the case
im sympathetic but isnt this all a bit navel gazingy trivialising even
i still dont know the proper salutation when addressing a female in a letter i use ms but i dont if that is outmoded and a product of the sixties worse still when you dont know the gender and have to use dear mrms
what if fluctuating hormone levels make you feel different at different times
absolute rubbish i opened my copy at random and glanced at the page two gentlemen of verona she occurs many times opened again at random measure for measure he occurs many times you have written he in your answer by the way shakespeare has an e on the end
and this is an english problem ive been using they as both genderless singular and genderless plural my entire life and have never once encountered a problem indeed until recently i hadnt even noticed that it could theoretically be a problem
so we just need a new word for the third person singular
reverse the default meaning of man to meaning human and human to man with a new plural of humenresurrect the defunct middle english thee and accord it new meaninghe to thee and thee to he thee rhymes and alliterates nicely with shehim to newly minted creation of thim and so onhe and him becoming the new genderless singular norms many speakers of other languages will find this more logical when learning english while they and them can remain as genderless neutralshttpsenwiktionaryorgwikithee
in  joan scott wrote that gender is not just about sex but is also a primary way of signifying relationships of power two decades since she wrote that these battles continue as does the battle against innumeracy
ive been using they in such cases since i was about six is this really such a revolutionary concept
what would you say if daniel didnt identify as either specifically male or female
i dont think thats the problem though where you are talking about a specific person its obviously fine to use he or she as appropriate but where you are conjuring up an abstract genderless individual when a reader first starts this book he will immediate notice the authors unique style its a shame to have to either use a word indicating a single gender when youre specifically trying to include both genders or to endlessly write he or she and break up the flow of the sentence
the language approach is slightly different many professions doctors lawyers now have mascfem versions docteurdoctoresse avocatavocate what makes things confusing is when you address a woman doctor you still say bonjour docteur
there are thousands of unemployed people and many more thousands who are working poor but please lets talk about sexism in the english language really this is what the left with a capital l needs to be adressing because who wants to talk about how awful globalisation and free trade has been for many working class people instead lets focus on how transethnic monosexuals are oppressed in britbongistan ffs
i do use they in situations where it sounds reasonably natural if someone were to walk in now they would grasp the situation immediately you could teach this to a child of five and they would have no trouble understanding it contact the best candidate and ask them if they would be able to attend on a different date its less clumsy than writing he or she all the time which i find breaks the flow of a sentencei cant bear writing he to mean any random person not least because ive been left sensitised to these things by the process of reading enid blyton to my daughters answering their aggrieved questions on the inherent sexism of her works and thereafter facing frequent interruptions for detailed protofeminist critiques
wont work for aliens
gender is what you call yourself funny i thought you called yourself he thanks
i cant get hold of the parts mate
but cock is feminine in french
thats what he said in her article surely
 plurals are neuter its les for everything it get a weird when the subject is male but has a description or status which is feminine eg la victime the victim he then starts getting talked about as she in a newspaper account of the event
as written i instinctively thought that the culprits go to the principal but shouldnt it be headmastermistressteacher
yes grisgris is just my avatar so whats you point john
roughly equivalent to the american yall ive been assured by a southern american gentleman that yall is singular the plural is all yall
so is penis what do you infer from that
there is something defensive in the resort to they that i am far from sure is justified the culture of sexism is rooted in inheritance where land rights are critical and women are unable to control their fertility in our world neither of these are relevant but the cultural baggage persists often entrenched by religion that sexism is not associated with language is evidenced by genderless languages associated with very sexist and much less sexist societies
it was a having a wonderful time in the pool 
yes the iranians are marvellously prowomens rights
i was a kid in the s and im fairly sure we were told the opposite i think your teacher had the right idea but i still think it looks odd
sounds too plural for me
i agree it just looks odd to describe one person as theyi think aa milne had it right however its a pity heesh never caught on but i suppose that even if it had wed be arguing over its inherent sexism because it starts with he there would be a movement calling for shehe insteadthat said this is an important point i just think we need something instead of they could we not borrow from our swedish chums
down here in progressive somerset we avoid all such gender issues by asking things like is e telling i
the fact of there being both he and she is pretty equal with regards they its just a pragmatism issue in making oneself understood efficiently and over time they is proving more efficient than he or she for many people because you dont have to stumble over a longer version to include both language is not owned and controlled by the oed and accordingly they has evolved
i have used they to denote a single person whose gender is unspecified for at least fifty years i remember this was useful as a teenage girl at a singlesex school because it meant you could refer to a conversation you had had without the usual grilling from your friends that would have taken place if they thought you were referring to a boy i have also always thought that if an idea was worth repeating the gender of the person who expressed it was simply a distraction
or pants
further thought
i have always used it this way not from any explicit desire to display any kind of credentials but as the most logical solution to needing something genderneutral i have never given this further to fit before reading this article
im getting a bit confused here your sentence if i have understood correctly would mean that even though you know the sex of your flatmate you also know that they are non binary hence the use of they otherwise he or she would be appropriate or at least acceptable
dallaswilliams writes here to apologise to helloguardianers and to the englishspeaking world for my oops no for their sic criticisms of lorraine berrys ridiculous commentary
cant remember where this came from but someone once said that in the s and s while the left was arguing about pronouns the right took over the worldor words to that effect
the french have been trying it for years and have been failing miserably
man used to be the genderneutral term for a human in old english too a male human was a wereman and a female human was a wifman eventually wereman dropped out of use man came to be used a males specifically as well as humans generaly while wifman mutated into woman
interesting picture of maria singular when i look at that picture i see an individual singular i dont see a they unless there is another she or he hiding behind the first individual we really are getting our knickers in a grammatical twist
the earth is edging relentlessly nearer to climate change oblivion but its of equal importance that onetheysheheit gets this pronoun gender issue sorted
if you think my indicates possession please explain my lord
really themself whats so wrong with themselves context should clarify it
dear god there are several genderless languages in the world turkish for instance and it clearly hasnt stopped rampant sexism there what a load of nonsense
thats the spirit thanks 
german manages with sie as a multidisciplinary pronoun but it makes a difference whether it has a capital s or not not sure how they hear that in speech though
depends on what follows but generally not
nothing but every generation needs to discover the world for themselves 
for males we use master for minors and mr for adults maybe the female titles could be used the same way miss could be retains but only for minors mrs or ms could be for adults although do we actually still do that i havent actually seen that used for a long time and then only on formal letters
come on people in the uk have been using they in this way as long as i can remember ie since the early s and i dare say the same is true of other englishspeaking countries the only thing that needs to be settled is whether we can extrapolate new derivative pronouns like themself which by the way ive already seen in the guardian and find a very good idea
that would be in the saloon bar
that seems to be a relatively recent interpretation im sure not that long ago it wasnt uncommon to use it to refer to people at least in certain circumstances eg infants or unidentified people theres someone at the door who is it where as now i periodically run into people who think it is offensive to even refer to animals as it
it is syntactically its either the culprits or the teacher and the culprits
slightly perhaps hopefully its hard to measure isnt it
ok so heesh then all for it refreshing to see there is an interest to make english less sexist
do you seriously refer to humans as it
try to pronounce that without sounding as if youre sniggering
i use he because i am a man women should use she averages things out and tells you the gender of the writer
im glad to know that my boss is in fact one of my posessions
ladies should work better shouldnt it
damn another secret of the illuminati revealed
what about us testosterone fuelled binary hunks who object to being called they she it etc we may look granite hard but we too have feelings which should be respected
so teenagers saying they is are correct after all
this is a very puzzling pieceas a kid in the s i was taught that they should be used in in place of he or she in cases where gender was unknown or not relevant so whats new
into what
if women have been writing he as the default thats dumb
and this is an english problem while english was picking and choosing its vocabulary from latin and german so many other languages turkish hungarian finnish persian are entirely genderless are turks hungarians finns and iranians less sexist as a result
sounds like nonsense to me
you called they is also used for unspecified singulars has been for ages
how about thing
we agree on something
i also found that very weak its hardly the fault of the language is the authors friends lacked imagination as a child
evolution is over
as written the teacher the culprits arent going to go to the principal unless somebody makes them if the teacher identifies the culprits they send the culprits to the principal would be better anyway since it makes clear who does what
and funnily enough in english girl used to mean in the middle ages a young child of either sex now it is just for female children funny how language evolves
good luck when you go into a pub in newcastle and say to a bunch of binary blokes would you women mind making room i need to get to the bar
juvenile pretentious undergraduate nonsense like this will keep the left from ever experiencing power for a long long time
do we alienate potential converts by insisting they use befuddling academic terms no actually people like ohagan alienate people by wanting to control what they think she was disappointed in adichies comments and that she has expressed a flawed opinion and should have the chance to change that opinion this is about thought control its not about language theres a difference and its clear that ohagan does not understand it
and yet i am aware that this places me on the wrong side of the approved opinions spectrum does it whats wrong with the terms cis women and trans women no one is suggesting you erase the distinction completely i mean do you have the same problem in wanting to distinguish between black women and asian women just because both want to be called women
what do you mean by real 
miss ohagan does the left have a problem with language orthodoxy i would answer that the left has an enormous problem living in the real world obsessing about language orthodoxy and identity politics are the least of the problems to say that the modern left faces challenging times is a gross understatement we need to build a movement lets see how building a movement is going these days dateline  march  am the labour party has lost  members over the last four weeks official party documents have revealed thousands of members have chosen not to renew their subscription to the party and hundreds have resigned citing labours approach to brexit as the main reason a leaked internal analysis published in todays times shows  members left just last week about  per cent of these people joined to take part in the  leadership election and immediately went into arrears the report said the other  per cent joined to take part in the  leadership election and didnt renew their membership after the first year the latest figures come after leaked data revealed labour has lost nearly  members since last summer dont you think ms ohagan that this indicates its time for the left to enter the real world before it disappears up its own fundamental orifice
this also applies to nonpolitical jargon like all those business buzzwords and selfhelp terms
i was just laughing at that channel  interview does it matter how you arrived at being a woman well i got off the number  and looked down and it was gone

nwaqueer as folkspurs fans
christ on a bike the left runs the risk of sending a message that it is not like the very people it is supposed to be fighting for in some ways thats intentional the whole point of the left is to oppose the mainstream and shift society in a new direction and in that respect we want to be different from the ordinary that might be the most indulgent pointless and exclusive definition of what being of the left is i call myself left because i believe in bringing about a material change in the economic circumstances of the working class parsing the various subsections of identity in no way represents what i think being left is so clearly thats me out of your supposedly welcoming world for a start no wonder it feels like so many people on the left have contempt for the working class if this is what the movement has descended to you might want to think about being different to the people youre fighting for i dont suppose you reckon thats why labour is haemorrhaging support from working class voters do you because if its a conscious strategy youre truly fucking insane
spot on the arrogance of even suggesting an opinion is incorrect without even feeling the need to attempt to demonstrate it is a rather worrying development nowadays nail on the head language orthodoxy or as the lay call it political correctness is a means of controlling opinion by controlling the vernacular words mentioned in the article like cis intersectionality and privilege incorporate by definition specific assumptionsworld views using them limits the scope of debate in the first instance which is why so many folks were offended by this womans lay opinion on the matter and this author felt the need to confirm that she does indeed hold those assumptions and is indeed one of us also merely using the holy words is a form of virtue signaling glory hallelujah
its just not good enough to accept the awful techniques of denialofmalice gaslighting from anyone ariel leve would dispute this point by adichie accuracy is extremely important to victims of force saying a bigoted statement and then saying its not bigoted in fact its progressive is gaslighting denying that abuse has occurred
cis is a useful shorthand word to name a kind of gender privilegei would literally laugh in the face of anyone who said this garbage me and in political terms would never in a million years support or vote for them whats wrong in speaking plain fucking english without all the shitty little labels and faux academic terms
in fact the whole quasireligious tone of this piece is deeply repellent the writer seems to believe that there is a true faith into which people can be drawn where they will have the doctrinally correct view on all conceivable matters and flawed opinions will be ironed out in the meantime the disciples should tolerate the sheep with their simple unorthodox terms and their flawed opinions as they gently lead them towards the true leftist light this mindset is truly puke inducing it is widespread on the left in my experience but seldom is it made as explicit as in this article 
above all we have to believe that the left can take people on a political journey because if we dont believe that well lose them forever yup youve got to reconnect with ordinary people so lets start by taking them on a journey of imagination
i completely agree with adichie on this we should be careful to make language as clear as possible in some contexts this will involve using technical words such as intersectionality cistrans etc in most contexts however its better to use words that would be understood by a general audience without the need to explain ive seen some ridiculous examples of language policing including  an article arguing that we should use an inclusive acronym lgtbqa to fight against heteronormativity the irony of creating an acronym to include everyone and anyone who wouldnt consider themselves outandout straight heteronormal heteronormative to fight the assumption that people are straight was lost on the author  a facebook share criticising the use of expressions saying women can be sexist too by arguing that sexism is a form of institutionalised oppression by patriarchal societies and therefore women as victims of this oppression cannot be sexist while i sympathise that some people use this as a way to dismiss the existence of sexism this is clearly equivocating an academic definition of sexism with a daytoday definition as someone who saysdoes something demeaning about a particular sex
nb irony was used in this post
the cumberbatch issue was the most famous case and he should know better but i was rather annoyed by it recently when had some trouble with an acquaintance whose first language isnt english who used coloured people instead of people of colour and the reaction was unbelievable everyone was that touchy about it that they didnt put it together that as hes not a native english speaker and has obviously learned that adjectives are usually placed before the noun and was not from this country and was actually saying something totally nice progressive and fine then he probably didnt mean any harm
your learning problem the left has is that the rest of of uk has rumbled their little trick 
wikipedia intersectionality is a concept often used in critical theories to describe the ways in which oppressive institutions racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism xenophobia classism etc are interconnected and cannot be examined separately from one another im glad i took engineering
if youre referring to miss adichie shes gorgeous and yes i am a sexist dinosaur
the other weekend i visited my poverty stricken working class home town up north and you know what i had this identical conversation about the use of intersectionality with somebody at morrisons
heh that may well be true it was just the first thing to pop into my mind cumberbatch was on the receiving end a while back too he didnt use the correct term which at the time was bame ooops sorrybefore i get accused of being a racist i meant to say bme if it has changed again subsequently apologies i didnt get the memo httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreemayblackasianminorityethnicbamebmetrevorphillipsracialminorities

lol
its a word taken from black people referring to white people who are not racistits been grafted on to any cause where it refers to someone not in the marginalised group in question who is an ally
seriously much of the problem the left has always had is its tendency to fall into internecine warfare over relatively minor questions of orthodoxy i think youre misunderstanding the problem the problem is that the left is an insanely broad term that actually covers an array of irreconcilable positions and deeply entrenched but opposing viewpoints the expectation that it should be unified only stems from the idea that there should be some sort of ideological bloc that is able to defeat the right
if society accepts them as trans women not women though then is that ok thats for them to decide but it strikes me as rather churlish to seek to exclude them i am sure that the details of discrimination suffered by gay men and lesbians are different but they dont seem to have a problem organising together the odd thing though is that i think it is trans women who should want to be in a separate group as a numerically very small group they are at risk of having their voices drowned out in a much bigger womens movement
looks like someone could welcome a hairbrush
part of the problem with jargon is that it tends to presume its conclusion when the right complain about cultural marxism or the left about internalized misogyny these are theories but people start treating them as confirmed fact because theres now a term to describe them
i am absolutely loving the comments under this article though i cant shake the feeling that someone in guardian towers is making a note of all our names and putting us down for reeducation
one can imagine ohagan scratching her head with a perplexed expression on her face wondering why huge political success is not guaranteed when a selfselecting group of busy bodies tell others how bad they are if they dare to have different opinions
and before anyone points out the slight contradiction if your opinion is everyone else must change their opinions to fit mine that doesnt count 
peoples liberation front of judea vs judean peoples liberation front seriously much of the problem the left has always had is its tendency to fall into internecine warfare over relatively minor questions of orthodoxy not that the right doesnt do this too last weeks healthcare bill fiasco in the us is a good example but the left tends to do it much more often and over relatively minor issues and even gaffes such as cumberbatchs slip in a speech
well thats true of everyone i suppose what i mean to ask is why should anyone be accepting of racismis it a diverse opinion to want to keep the uk for whitesor to roll back on votes for womenor perhaps a differing view on the rights of gay people to be married there are some things that are plainly just bigotry and should be opposed
this attitude is another reason many are turned off by socalled leftists agree and so is the idea that evangelical leftists should seek converts presumably a remnant of her catholicism id wager
you cant make someone perceive you differently just by telling them to do so and you dont have a right to be perceived a certain way otherwise half the country would be demanding that people perceive them as the duchess of cambridge people will perceive you in whatever way they do by your appearance demeanour and actions up to you to make that work out the best you can
so like a narcissist she managed to derail the criticism of her bigotry into intentionality through the use of worddeconstruction i dont think this is something we on the left should be forced to accept we should not tolerate the intolerant saying trans women arent as real as real women is intolerant and we should not tolerate it i just dont care what her intention was she deliberately criticized trans women as not suffering as much as real women now those arent her actual words because she used sophistry to construct a deconstructable statement but the implication is chrystal clear there are real women and other women who arent as real and only real women have suffered as much so when she got caught out how did she respond just like the orangehaired ubernarcisssist youre taking me to literally and not seriously enough no i take words very literally
xy chromosome person there get out of that
that would imply that the left is aware of its craziness and evil my impression however is that most lefties honestly believe that they are the goodies and that their opponents are the crazy evil ones it doesnt matter how many times their ideas are demonstrated to be pernicious nonsense how many famines labour camps and mass killings there are how many albanias and venezuelas how many stalins maos and pol pots they still believe in their own virtue go figure as my american friends would say
even adichie who has done more to popularise feminism than  of women in the public eye can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion welcome to the world of extremes in which opinions with which one disagrees are never just opinions they are always flawed opinions and that in a nutshell is why normal people dislike and distrust political extremists whatever flag they fly under
heh that may well be true it was just the first thing to pop into my mind cumberbatch was on the receiving end a while back too
yeah we have those
i agreed with every word of your comment
fascist
well we have to be way down the incoherent rabbit hole of language for people to have argued that the feminist thing to do in the primaries was to support the candidate who advocated more violence against women of color abroad and generally represented the interests of white male corporate power within the democratic party and across the planet republicans dont have a lock on style over substance
black people have it much tougher in western societies than women do therefore all black people are women logic i wasnt suggesting that trans women having it tougher than women makes them women so this is a straw man trans women are women because women like most categorising terms is a somewhat nebulous and fluid concept that dates back to well before the discoveryconcept of genes and the normal everyday idea of a woman readily allows for the possibility of someone having transitioned im very happy to hear your counterargument except im not really because ive probably heard it before and its shit
my apologies i was wrong i stand corrected well done for winning the competition
who was shooting themselves in the foot benedict cumberbatch no the people who made such a big fuss about the use of a trivially different wording
except for the national association for the advancement of colored people then its okay
queer is actively embraced by the selfidentified queer community what makes this game especially annoying to outsiders is that words go out and then back into acceptability weve gone from negro to coloured to black to african to bame to something else next week similarly what started as lgb is rapidly running out of letters of the alphabet after recently gaining i assume fuel injection
they only like opinions that are the same as their own
the left shouldnt get hung up on identity to do so is to be bigoted
if woman has changed to be strictly a genderrelated term referring to anyone who considers themselves to have a female identity whats the correct word to use for a biological female im pretty sure that when most people use woman they mean biological sex but if its been decided that that words changed whats the replacement
why bother with the need to debate a subject when you can just shout heretic from your safe space bubble
why dont you feel guilty like the rest of us
no she has such a high opinion of her readers that she assumes well all know feeling flattered i suppose at guardian editorial conferences they speak of little else which could explain rather a lot

overlapping experiences with the female sex and being of the female sex are two separate things you ed me talking about overlapping experiences with cis women trans women have overlapping experiences with cis women both trans women and cis women are women thanks for demonstrating that it is indeed all in the way you phrase it i phrased it respectfully you phrased it in a way that exhibits your bigotry

hi flawed opinions can be found in abundance here httpswwwtheguardiancomukcommentisfree
good for ngozi adichie one of the most intelligent writers around as a heterosexual woman i reject the term cis i dont understand the term it doesnt define me so who is anyone else to label me as such
in some ways the lefts insistence on using complicated terms to define the world is a reaction to the fact that it is politically marginalised yes it reflects the lefts retreat into the universities after the defeats of the late s the use of complicated terms stems from the lefts absorption into indeed identification with a certain kind of humanities education and pedagogy the problem with that though is that what we might call linguistic leftism thus becomes simply a form of class politics ease with deploying the vocab reflects cultural and social privilege just as complicated table settings and etiquette once functioned as barriers to entry into the middle or upper classes for those from the less fortunate classes the minefields of critique and terminology now fence leftism off from anyone without the proper background read english at oxford or at least warwick or exeter good youll have a good chance of negotiating the mines and avoid blowing yourself up on twitter left school at  to work as an apprentice hairdresser but still interested in discussing feminism or leftwing politics online well good luck with that
we live probably always have in the era of the unneeded adjective the chief executive of my local hospital referred yesterday to a conscious decision her board had taken in contrast presumably to an unconscious decision although i could just about understand that ive seen her board however unless they were all asleep or drugged it could hardly have been other than a conscious decision i presume people think this adds weight to their writing what it actually does is add gaseous volume
movementspecifically jargon itself an inelegant phrase tends to be used when s simple idea needs to be presented as profound when a rubbish idea needs to be artificially buoyed up by gobbledegook when membership of an exclusive club needs to be flaunted generally speaking if people cannot express ideas or concepts in plain english then both the ideas and the people are probably inherently flawed andor insecure
people on the left especially those who identify most closely with social justice politics and philosophies tend to have very brittle approaches to language a more contextual approach would be healthier and actually more true to the fluidity of language use im an sjw and damn proud of it btw imo anyone who is against the ideals of social justice is literally by definition a fascist but the kneejerk reactions of some people can be damn unhelpful
does the left have a problem with language orthodoxyyes it purposely invents whinging fakeacademic sounding terms like rape culture problematic cis and check your privilege and attacks those who dontwont use them it creates laughable contradictory rules that must be followed coloured person is a racial slur but person of colour is normal and correct it denounces bigotry towards minoritynot minority but still oppressed groups women aint a minority but has absolutely no problem turning around and saying heres what all straightwhitemale people do wrongneed to change its a movement thats crawled so powerfully thoroughly up its own arse that it attacks feminist icons of the s as sexist and noplatforms humans with perfectly valid views all while trump and brexit burn away in the background i hate the modern left truly hate it if i was born in the s s s s s id be a thoroughly committed leftie but the modern form ick
what do you mean when you say diverse opinions in this context
exactly its an incredibly strange semantic minefield weve created for ourselves in english language of england please
well yes thats obvious now i felt really sorry for him it was an honest act that he didnt have to do and he got shat on
the main problem with these people i have no idea why they consider themselves left they have completely hijacked what was the left and destroyed it is as soon as the normal person in the street starts using one of their pc terms they will jump to another this is the means they use to seemingly put themselves above us mere mortals by that definition they want to be an exclusive little club and it amazes me that they are then surprised when they are beaten to a pulp at the ballot box exclusive little clubs dont win majorities in democratic elections by definition get used to the wilderness and remember you chose it in the meantime i can only hope a new movement that represents the values of the traditional left can emerge
i think it has been taken over by spoiled middle class ideologues who are used to being over indulged by their parents they are now angry to see the world isnt what they want it to be hence the infantile battle cry that is now a legitimate political comment its not fair from a spoiled kid to a grown adultthere is little difference
exactly its an incredibly strange semantic minefield weve created for ourselves in english
soon there wont be a navel big enough for us to argue about gazing into
yeah i suppose so but i dont come into contact with them they seem more to ignore me and ill ignore them
spot on i think the biggest irony for me at least is that trans people insist quite rightly on us using the pronouns they prefer for them but wont extend us the same courtesy
do we alienate potential converts by insisting they use befuddling academic terms they mostly are befuddled academics if we detached feminism from useless people who teach and study in humanities departments wed be going places as long as someone is writing a blog post about applying intersectional praxis to the question of whether mens ties are misogynistic heteronormative violence then well be going nowhere
and how can it be a flawed opinion is that the old all opinions are equally valid chestnut
coloured people is despicable horrible and irredeemably racist people of colour is cool enlightened tolerant and allaround virtuous hey those are the rules
very true especially as it was strongly promoted by new labour who wanted to differentiate themselves from the conservatives while essentially pushing conservativeesque economic policies
the whole point of the left is to oppose the mainstream and shift society in a new direction and in that respect we want to be different from the ordinary the whole point of the left is to make things better for most people especially the worst off through collective action you harsh language that goes some small way to expressing my utter hatred of those who hijacked the movement which gave us the nhs and welfare state and twisted it into a niche cliche for victim olympics
heres my issue i wish to retain my right to make an internal distinction between born women and transexual women there is no scientific argument available which has persuaded me that it is wrong immoral or incorrect to maintain that distinction and yet i am aware that this places me on the wrong side of the approved opinions spectrum i can fully understand that an individual desires that they be treated and considered as a woman or as a man however i can only do this by going against my own desires to make rational distinctions between distinct types of entity
 i think the terms cisgender and transgender should be banned outright  damn right
you dont think the conservative banker toffs in the wine bars would also raise a laconic eyebrow at your accent
im pretty turned off by the amount of effort and air expended on the sort of thing this article is talking about the left wing has somehow been taken over by middle class chatter boxes who are as soft as cashmere ooooh its so warm and snuggly why cant the world be like cashmere
i know youre jokinghowever i have a theory that im serious about the chasm there is a huge chasm perhaps crossed by a rope bridge out of indiana jones very dangerous on one side people discuss pronouns and toilets on the other people either physically attack or just tut silently at trans people my natural position might be more than half way across that bridge but as thats so risky i wouldnt bother saying anything
and i for one do not agree that ms adichies opinions on trans women are at fault if it were white men deciding that they are actually black this paper would be all over them for cultural appropriation how is deciding to be a woman after thirty years as a man anything other than gender appropriation ms adichie and an earlier example ms greer stated nothing but truth
having seen the writer on television after the brexit vote i suspect strongly that it is not a spoof 
you however we need to build a movement and if even adichie who has done more to popularise feminism than  of women in the public eye can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion without being given the chance to change that opinion we may as well all pack up and go home now flawed opinion who the hell do you think you are
there comes a point when the use of a word changes in response to social change one thinks of negro or other derivatives of it it wouldve been regarded as merely factual once but somewhere along the line its use became so loaded up with negativity that it could not be used reputably barring some postmodern reclamation by those who previously had to suffer that negativity who can say when this point exactly comes but be it negro queer yid or whatever we all instinctively know when it has been passed and when it becomes inexcusable to use the word and pretend you have just a literal meaning in mind are we there yet with the trans terminology that ellie mae writes about i think its very hard to say we are it may well come in time but for now it cannot be right that people are shouted at for transgressing language rules that only a small minority of people are aware of and which even standardbearers of identity politics can get wrong in fact you could argue that if changing attitudes through changing language truly is the aim these transgressions to the extent that they are transgressions should be met with far more understanding and far less sanctimony that they are not suggests its more about the need of some to show off their righton credentials
i dont remember what cis is supposed to mean and i dont know and never did know what intersectionality is meant to convey this language has nothing to do with the left or our movement it comes from united states feminist academe and should have been left there if you want to know how this version of the left has marginalized itself from peoples everyday concerns look no further if you want to know why the answer does lie in this article although its not properly challenged there it confers a superior sense of exclusivity on those who use it what it doesnt do and has never done is win any arguments anywhere ever
the lefts great moral strength used to be its absolute commitment to treat and give a voice to all in society equally equality of opportunity equality of esteem but an inadvertent sideeffect of the rise of identity politics is that the left has stopped talking to everyone and it too often falls into the trap of moral relativism theres always a good reason why some groups are indulged over behaviour and attitudes which would be rightly condemned in other groups splintering society into more and more subgroups and constructing a hierarchy of intrinsic rightness or importance between different groups is literally no different from rightwing bigotry trans women clearly share some life experiences with everyone born male some experiences with people transitioning the other way some experiences with intersex people and some experiences with everyone born female theyre not the same as every other group and theyre neither more nor less important than any other group the left has an unarguable moral purpose to help give a voice to those who feel society doesnt recognise them or demeans or marginalises them but that cant be at the expense of caring just as much about every component of society including people who can be described as being part of a majority and even those who could be described as being overprivileged in some way
i do apologise its hard to tell with the usernames my points go to the actual author then
maybe if youd written in english it would have been easier
i think that shows your bias and willful ignorance you also demean the memory of the people who served during the troubles in n ireland or the falklands and lost their lives
unlike remainers who just shruggive a rueful grinthen continue on their way whistling
this is how it was explained to me by an african american friend no its not offensive to mention race in describing someone but it may be if its the first or only thing you mention how would i describe the same person if they were the same race as myself white the woman in the yellow dress for example i think its simply that by virtue of nonwhite races being a minority we tend to pick that out as the most distinguishing feature and its that tendency more than the words themselves that causes offence
it was the wrong thing to do violence is never a solution
and if those with right wing views feel strongly enough to fight for something will you trot out the usdual left wing descriptions of them or can we expect some sort of street scenes
no i agree it doesnt mean that theres a middle ground and the lesson is surely that you should think very hard about the words you use either because they may offend and harm or because you could unfairly label someone as bigoted
fair enough and like i said im not going to speak for himher but that line of reasoning has become depressingly familiar its basically the a racistfascistidiot is anyone who disagrees with you defence when these are all clearly defined terms its become the standard indignant kneejerk reaction to anyone pointing out that these intolerant views seem to be more tolerated and acceptable post brexit see also the professional contrairians discussed in the article who also deign to speak for the masses and when their bigoted hate filled bile is contested claim that they are somehow the victims
wade through the qualifications and caveats and its the same old argument language should be censored to spare peoples feelings sorry youre bang wrong unless you are inciting imminent violence or criminal activity free speech should be regarded as absolute free speech is not one interchangeable right amongst many its the foundational right of western civilisation and it is a zero sum game you cannot have partial free speech you either have free speech is you dont if speech occasionally offends so be it
it is such a jumbled e charitable interpretation or sneaky wording charitable interpretation its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed the bit in bold makes the white straight male bit redundant surely it suggests that you can be white straight and male and not classprivileged so why mention race sex and sexual orientation at all
stop participating in this laughable discussion thats the kind of thing lefties used to say to each other in the student union bar
freedom isnt freeit costs folks like you and me
worrying about words to this extent is evidence of a tired old decadent civilization which has talked itself out of touch with reality
a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps i read this and was intrigued how a study could show any such thing i followed the link which takes you to a daily mail article the daily mail article does say that scientists have found that mens attitudes have made women so nervous that many are now likely to avoid maps altogether however it offers no explanation or evidence that this is so or any link to any such evidence finding this unsatisfactory i looked up the summary of the study on the kings college website the relevant paragraph says the researchers also found a small but significant gender difference in their sample with women showing higher levels of anxiety than men across all areas the study authors opinion is that this could be due to women being more willing to disclose their feelings of anxiety or anxiety caused by the stereotype that stem subjects are for men so the study did not find that the stereotype that women are bad at reading maps causes anxiety indeed the study had no findings on the cause of any difference in gender anxiety at all the reports authors opinion was that it was one possible explanation come on guardian you can do better than this
thats my objection to too much introspection certainly in this case the violence at berkeley was from anti fascists who dont have any time for the liberal left and yet its now held up as an example of what the left do that benefits the right and i dont think theres much to be gained in mea culpas for tactics used by those who arent even necessarily part of the same movement any more than a tory voter needs to be held responsible for the edl as to free speech the right wing rags are always criticising people for saying the wrong thing it wasnt a left paper which called judges enemies of the people for doing their job
dont you think we are already there take hate speech for example some groups are excluded from protection the law pertaining to hate crime also has the clause that the victims perception of whether a hate crime occurred is important in classification of whether or not it was a hate crime and that questioning of a victim by the police can lead to secondary victimization so we currently have a law that can arrest people not on their actual actions but on the perceived intent of their actions by a person who perceives themselves to be a victim of the intentions that may only actually exist in their mind thats pretty orwellian in my book add to it the wider cultural context this is happening in where as i mentioned above some people are automatically excluded from ever been classed as victims and are instead classed as default oppressors purely down to the group they are born into then clearly we have a recipe for disaster
youre mistaken it wasnt society regulating itself that for instance nipped fascism in the bud here in britain but decisive government action through the public order act  which in response to the growing popularity of the british union of fascists buf banned political uniforms and required police consent for political marches in  the buf was banned outright by the government and oswald mosley with hundreds of other fascists were interned for much of the second world war without government intervention things could have turned out quite differently with society regulating itself
i remember when they did it live on television directed at salmon rushdie i dont remember any arrests though anjem choudary arrested just last year for supporting isis httpswwwtheguardiancomuknewsauganjemchoudaryconvictedofsupportingislamicstate
the evidence the journalist fails to find is under her very nose in and on every single university campus as we speak and in almost every speech made by people like herself politicians and leftie luvvie liberals trump can be abused as a racist sexist etc etc but a  year economic immigrant sneaking or buying his way into uk must be protected even if they commit horrific crimes jeez you wanted equality well give it to everyone
words have realworld effects really confused by this article if words can be harmful who decides who gets to say them and to whom the author seems to be stating the obvious without resolving anything
yeah im sure miloampco are devastated if ppl who arent in their target audience anyway think theyre arseholes as for mocking anyone no matter the context as an exercise in democracy you will notice that you cannot do that usually this argument stands when the target of the mockery is weak and cannot fight back minorities women migrants they should be able to take it its only free speech right milo actually said he was building bridges with his act try mocking someone with power long enough to actually trigger them youll be gone in two seconds but yeah democracy is ok when you shit on someone whos already seen as loo roll
theres a debate to be had we need to have a proper debate how any times have we heard that from the pc liberals just before they shut any real debate down with cries of racist sexist islamophobe
now youve offended him
indeed what does it say about the left the fact that lifelong guardian readers like me end up regularly visiting sites like the spectator and breitbart in order to read articles about certain issues that arent disingenuous nonsense
micro aggressions is spot on i think by product of tolerance in a world that tells you to turn the other cheek you become so habituated to what youve been told you dont notice what twts people can be
its very interesting reading the comments daily on features such as these each day its a reminder what sheltered lives we lead since the attitudes espoused by some simply astonish me assuming the majority are in the uk can it really be true that the country is still stuck in the the its political correctness gone mad stage unable to recognise the multiple dimensions by which stereotypes are constructed and to think that since weve been up over again it is often suggested to me up that new zealand must be backward in its outlook
right so on the basis that almost anything done or said will harm someone somewhere whether directly or indirectly then noone should do or say anything ever
i think we have to be kind of honest here what were seeing is a backlash against the people who believe in microaggressions and the prioritising of how everyone feels rather than what the reality is the downside is that the backlash is largely made up of trolls who are just revelling in the opportunity to stick it to the holier than thou people who make up the sjw left the important point though is that the mainstream are tolerating this backlash because its not entirely something they disagree with many of us have long said on here that the way discussions on the guardian and indeed other leftwing outlets are framed tends to pit one group or all disadvantaged groups against another group white peoplemen generally this was just never going to make anyones lives better it was stupid and now were seeing why the silver lining is that eventually itll probably swing back the other way
yes the statutes of the public order act  prevents speech which intends to stir up racial hatred with various amendments and additions in the related   and  acts theyre still free to say and think that kind of dimwitted bullshit they just should take more care who hears it freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences
i found the article elsewhere and read it although missed the point that the other person want gay but my point was that without any alleged assault there would have been no potential crime to investigate and the author doesnt prove that it was investigated and pursued just because of the hate crime element
nor did abi wilson imply that there is or should be such a right no right not to be offended is a nice snappy slogan of course and in some contexts it even has meaning but its so often railroaded in service of the idea that there is something noble about causing offence theres no right not to be offended but it is not unreasonable to expect adults to try to avoid needless gratuitous offence and if you are gratuitously offensive you have no right not to be judged and censured for it not least because it shows how little you think of other people if we want to minimize unintended injury including offence then we naturally have to put some thought into identifying behaviours that cause unintended harm think about why that might be and make a judgment about whether and how to modify those behaviours thats just civilized we all do it to some degree at least in interactions with those around us some do it naturally and instinctively some make it a core mission and even build academic careers around it some are more or less bad at it and some choose to be obstreperous assholes just for the joy of it
unfortunately in these latter days of deep intersectionality where one minority fortifies itself against another and by doing offends them even the act of enquiring as to why one particular outgroup does not like a certain type of phrase or word is seen as an act of violence one is supposed to instinctively know what causes offence to groups one does not belong to it seems there is something similar to what used to be described in the disability world as a heirarchy of oppression in that one persons minority is more oppressed than another and there is no discourse or solidarity between any more
no not in part in whole no not in whole in part you are making the mistake of treating skills as if they were binary you got it or you dont mapreading maths and even shopping are skills that you can pick up quickly but then take a while to master its been scientifically proven that skill diminishes with low expectations which can be conferred by stereotypes it shouldnt really need to be scientifically proven though because everyone should be able to admit if from their own experience when youre confident you get good at something far more quickly confidence is influenced to a greater or lesser degree by the way the world reflects your own image back at you so not irrelevant at all
um here in canada we have people attempting to silence kindhearted radical feminists because they dont support teenage boys having access to girls shower rooms and have opinions that dont precisely line up to everything that the lgbt community insists upon so the left silencing the left pretty brilliant see podcasts from feminist current on this subject sorry some people on the left have freakin completely forgotten what democracy means its made those of us who use to live on the left move a little more right just to keep a distance from these sorts of outrageous actions
oh my goodness me how big wazs that twitterstorm the story you recount is one where a genuine misidentification of a nonhomophobic comment as homophobic has taken place the labelling is simply incorrect if the tale is squarely as you tell it and theres the problem the case seems perfectly clear it doesnt mean that each and every use of the word racist or homophobe is therefore wrong i bet there are cases where a person was called homophobic because they actually said or did something homophobic and your anecdote isnt a valid cover for them to use
these are a mere newfanglement of binary reflectionism through a modern interpretation of the old unionist movements percieved in a reverse psychological perspective yes im sure they are
agreed i dont like freemans views but i respect that she comes and stands up for them a few years ago it was very fashionable for prominent journos and other public figures to say that they never read the comments some advocated for getting rid of comments entirely that is incredibly arrogant in my view it is extremely unlikely that someone writing on any given topic knows more than each of the often hundreds of people commenting on that article i almost always learn far more from the comments than the article noone is able to be wellinformed on every topic i rely on the comments to point out omissions an mistakes in the article as a rule if there are no comments i will not read the article as i cannot be confident i am not being misled
yes but be warned that the conservative side is probably not what you think it is it is a multitude on the look out for liberal hypocrisy on social issues and they have spent the last few days digging up countless examples of liberal figures speaking equivalently of teenage sexuality
in which case communism doesnt exist so ill just go back to calling them all nazis like i usually do this is such nonsense such ignorance on political theory such lazy dismissal of a case for the sake of bending facts to own vision that im happy it came soon enough for me to stop participating in this laughable discussion
rather people are now aware that by finding something that they can tenuously claim is offensive to some vanishingly small hypothetical community they can be the centre of attention to the twitter mob and perhaps manipulate the actions of someone richer or more powerful than themselves just because you dont find something offensive and you lack the imagination to appreciate how someone else might dont assume that their outrage is manufactured i think a lack of empathy is the biggest problem here both sides failing terribly to appreciate a point of view other than their own and imputing bad faith i cant understand for a minute why grown men think a football stadium is the only place it is safe to express emotion but i dont doubt that the tears are genuine what is far more common than the scenario you describe is the person who builds a career solely on the basis of being offensive as a conduit for the darkest most hurtful impulses of others if you disagree please name some celebrities who have become famous as a result of their perpetual offencetaking
i dont see that with any other word being used in this publication so would describe it as a fairly strongly and widely held view so why is it being ignored it is being ignored because dereclaiming it would be defeat could you ever imagine a bunch of academics or the guardian staff admitting they had it wrong if somebody called me queer to my face id more than likely headbutt them but i am expected to somehow not cringe or cringe only slightly internally when i read it
i would say no to ban people speaking with views like holocaust denial only reinforces their argument that the holocaust is a lie and it is been covered up by all jewish controlled goverments its better to debate and debunk these people and their conspiracies in the open
as always i note that those who preach the liberty to offend are often the biggest cry babies when offended they also wear tinfoil hats and worry about restrictions to their freedom that are at best overblown
we live in a world full of dicks just accept it deal with it and get on with it you know full well that trying to use political correctness to monitor and dampen down all the dickishness has no chance of succeeding because its simply an aspect of the human character with abundant evidence for it in every sphere of human dealings so just give it up and get on with building the thick skin required to negotiate it rather than cowering away in some corner like some whining child complaining that words can be harmful and people should control themselves please king canute had more chance of holding back the waves than you have of holding back the tide of dickery
but isnt the problem that we only like freedom of speech when the speech is in agreement with our worldview the shutting down of free speech with blunt pejorative labels like homophobe islamophobe xenophobe when all you really mean is i dont like your opinion is one of the roots of the problem and a tactic i see deployed in the pages of the guardian as much as anywhere else
the world will tell us that sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me whereas gods word tells us that one wrong or cruel word can do as much harm as the tiny spark that sets a forest fire james  warns so too the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it makes great brags see how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze dont we all know that that is the truth words can be powerful for good or powerful to do harm and if political correctness meant treating every one with the kindness and respect that we would like for ourselves i would be all for it that is after all the golden rule but for me its the political part of pc that is the problem because it seem to tell us who must be treated with respect and who can safely be disrespected it ubers and it unters that is what i dont like about it
probably when they also become wary of the one size fits all narrative
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should well said so pc types the next time you are about to make a fool of yourself by saying you cant say that to someone dont you have a right to say it but it makes you look stupid and people will laugh at you
i think it is a false equivalence to bring katie hopkins et al into the debate she says what she will say because she has the skin of a rhinoceros and doesnt give a flying but also because noone else in the media is saying it whether she is right or wrong in whatever viewpoint she is currently championing the idea that because it is a nonpc topic she will be the only person to say it is what is wrong in my view far too many other journalists are kowtowed by the lynch mob twitterati the only reason for katie hopkins to exist is because the mainstream media cannot discuss anything even remotely nonpc so they rely on their figures of hate and discuss it around them if open discourse was a normal thing as it was forty years ago then there would be no need and no space for the katie hopkinsstyle voice people are feeling constrained and irritated by this endless holierthanthou political correctness political correctness which is always enforced by the most aggressive lynch mob style discourse out there the bile and unreflective viciousness that comes from the leftwing selfrighteous when they have found their target is extraordinary the hypocrisy is outstanding they are screaming at katie hopkins i hope you drown in the blood of your own children whilst supposedly defending politicallycorrect speech and being nonoffensive i would suspect as well that the most vociferous are not even the group who are purportedly being offended but those who are getting offended on their behalf the left still refuses to see that most of the rise of the rightwing is a direct reaction to their own pushing of extreme leftwing not even genuinely political not marxist but rather fringe policies please moderators do not moderate me because i am bringing up the r word every time this subject is brought up within a comment the post gets moderated but the truth is rotherham existed it is not fake news it is fact fact it happened it is shameful that it continued on as long as it did it is shameful that some journalists were prevented from publishing the facts because it did not fit with the leftwing perception of multiculturalism it is shameful but true that political correctness was the very reason the situation in rotherham continued for as long as it did without intervention and i wonder how have we got to the stage where individuals are so frightened frightened to say the wrong thing frightened to the point that they will let extraordinary abuses continue against vulnerable children and others rather than be accused of saying the wrong thing they may think at present that it is all ok because it is the left curtailing what is said so it suits their agenda all great but if it is the left then it can be the right if it is not ok to say that you disagree with immigration for example without being shut down then the reverse can equally happen and it can be not ok to speak out for or agree with immigration without being shut down it works both ways if it is not allowed to say you disagree with homosexuality then equally you can go back to the days when it was not allowed to agree with homosexuality then your katie hopkins becomes your solzhenitsyn people have to be free to take and express the opposite line to the majority we need to be free to argue the point but what the left is currently doing is going way beyond censorship it is saying that using the word coloured instead of black is not allowed it is taking offence where there is none given it is looking for reasons to yell and scream and howl abuse at others all the while taking a perverse selfrighteous attitude it is beyond a joke it is pernicious young people seem to have lost the ability to argue through reason and discourse they base their arguments on whether they are hurt or not this is the level of a twoyear old and it is deeply worrying two year olds have not mastered their emotions they react exactly on the level that they feel the emotion adults master selfcontrol and use reason and mind or at least that is what should be aspired to but rather the whole media and population seems to want to aspire to the opposite where all that is important is feelings or offence anybody can choose or opt to take offence at anything if you constantly try to base policy or debate or censorship around the offenderati you will be locked into a tyranny reason consideration intelligence mind over matter selfcontrol when did all these go in favour of offencetaking censorship and the twitterati
that non straight younger adults have more suicidal thoughts than people of a more usual sexual orientation could be for many reasons its unclear what connection the author is drawing between words and the more genderly fluid being suicidal
this article is a straw man argument against political correctness the main criticism of political correctness is that it regiments thinking and discourages free thinking being against political correctness doesnt necessarily mean that you can be free to be offensive that is kept in check by common decency and not any pc dogma that is unnecessary what is important is factual correctness which is necessary to get to the truth political correctness can contradict factual correctness and is therefore misleading at best dangerous at worst for example if it has been scientifically proven that men are better at map reading than women this can be seen as factually correct but political incorrect
ok true ive seen videos of the edl doing their thing and youre right it mainly seems to be the left who oppose free speech though
i think when people use words to try to argue for a debate for free speech whilst simultaneously shutting that debate down i think it is fair to regard that as orwellian saying a debate is academic is not shutting it down and in fact saying its academic while citing a reason that katie hopkins is the thick end of the wedge from which any such debate should start is actually inviting and instigating the debate more than it is suppressing it she is effectively saying surely we can at least agree as a starting point that hopkins is frequently over the line and shouldnt be granted a platform
were currently in the midst of something of a backlash against political correctness oh i think its going to be far more than a mere backlash its going to be the end of it full stop another lesson learned for the west political correctness is first and foremost an attack on free speech clear thinking and discussion political correctness is perpetrated by the left in politics as a cover for their flawed ideology a sort of cultural marxism by cloaking their strange ideas under the cover of not wishing to offend anyone which naturally appeals to peoples better nature they try to bypass debate and give a received wisdom which must not be questioned and anyone who disagrees with this received wisdom must therefore be a really nasty person and deserves to be ostracised by their peers this peer pressure is instrumental in enforcing and expanding political correctness for example if you question whether unfettered immigration into this country is necessarily a good thing or perhaps whether immigrants should be health checked then you must be a nasty bigoted little englander come on everyone shout him down with cries of racist of course only the hard of thinking could be drawn into this charade anyone with an ounce of common sense can see right through it httpwwwpoliticallyincorrectmeukindexhtml precisely which is why it is now collapsing
thats a better questionyou would think anyone who speaks of breaking the law would not be given an enhanced platform to say what they like at universities for starters paedophilia praisers and terrorist extremistscursing is barred from childrens daytime tv thats already restriction of free speech most dont have a problem with
either its all okay or none of it is kyle broflovski doesnt mean you cant call out people like katie hopkins for propagating unwarranted destructive hate though problem is that the leftliberalnicewhatever message being put over by the other side has to be better and more persuasive you cant fall back on just calling opponents juvenile or trolls however true that may be truth is that right wing ideas are taking hold and have emboldened sections or society which had been written off years ago the response from places like the guardian so far has been weak defensive smug patronising thereby confirming every stereotype about snowflake lefties etc etc youre preaching to the choir here whilst labour completely loses its way with a self serving narcissistic leader right wing parties have a free reign bullies like katie hopkins just lubricate the wheel of selfish gleeful me first politics so no censorship isnt the answer you know maybe it really is time to toughen up a bit merely being offended isnt going to change the world sometimes you have to fight for something
oh kelvin
given microaggression is an imaginary problem and its your choice whether to be upset or ignore it the whole thing is laughable
the other person was gay he wasnt it became clear to me that it wasnt the nonassault they were interested in it was the homophobic aspect that had mysteri ously emerged  hours after the incident for the record my accusers sexuality had never entered my mind and it tran spired he wasnt gay but these allega tions provided the british transport police with a potential opportunity to notch up an allimportant statistic pointing to how wonderfully tough they are on hate crime zero tolerance every perceived slight is registered as a crime even in cases such as mine where the evidence is based only on the accusers own account
can you provide a source for the book burning incident please very interesting
its often said that the purpose of religious terrorism in europe has been to poison debate to the extent that society becomes more illiberal towards minority and more fundamentalists are recruited to the militiaswhen political and social debate is shut down this also serves to poison discourse because it becomes an easy victory for the conservative side to refer to the madness of the illiberal left in reality the arguments must be won on their own terms or the culture war will run for ever there has been insufficient recourse to philosophy and other relevant thought in the discussion of contemporary social liberalism it has resulted in the left coming across as very fragile and defensive the young have followed suit simply by shutting down debate in the context of their educational institution which for the moment are the settings where they have been allocated a degree of power one fears for the future of democratic debate when they move out of the campuses and into open political and social institutions
the fact that the left tend towards handwringing is actually pretty commendable it means they care about morality although it also means we tend to let the tories stay in power because were busy fighting each other as im totally guilty of here
oh and the moment pc is used to bury or suffocate an uncomfortable fact then it is doing humanity and the world a disservice when this happens id like to see graun journalists lining up to denounce the censorship and hold the fact high for all to learn from that we may knowledgeably improve our world there are cases in which complaints against pc are perfectly well founded and we have a morally decent law which it is at root being misused as a cover for harmful ideas
the problem has been the brexit alf garnetts know their life well enough not to value being able to decide to up sticks and live in berlin or paris or naples because they are never going to do it very few people percentage wise emmigrate and it is lazy thinking to presume that only alf garnets prefer to stay in the uk
there is a pull towards reason and justice yes thats exactly what i would say the left and liberalism generally is the pull toward reason and justice there is no higher reasoning involved in declaring that say i can redefine my gender at will and you have to use my preferred gender pronoun on pain of legal sanction of course there is whole books have been written appealing to this higher reason the short version as i understand it is that gender is a social construct limiting identity our identities are ultimately malleable and we should be as free as possible to define ourselves theres no particular benefit conferred by forcing everyone to define themselves as male or female except simplicity and that simplicity is not under any direct threat because most people still are happy to define themselves as male or female legal sanction might be going a bit far but its certainly reasonable to say that its rude and insulting to deliberately ignore or to try to correct someones preference for defining their own gender its really not asking much of you nor in discussing the relative merits of the cultures that islam has produced when compared with the west nor in any one of a thousand other things that you are trying to ring fence with this garbage no one is trying to ringfence islam i fall into that vast category of people who would quite happily welcome a mature debate about what aspects of traditional islamic practice ought to be rejected and how but find that the whole topic of conversation is dominated by a generalised bigotry that rejects the whole possibility of a benign muslim population same with other topics you are confusing ringfencing with trying to set out which extreme views are continuously rejected as unhelpful and uncompromising
oh come on im an averagely stupid individual certainly not trained in this area or familiar with its concepts but i can work out what the term means from the context without any difficulty so who reading this feature in this paper is likely to have difficulty doing the same
in which case communism doesnt exist so ill just go back to calling them all nazis like i usually do duhno the radical left are not anarchists that is bullshit jesus for one claiming to know history you sure seem to have not read anyanarchism might be could be argued to be a branch of the radical left but it is not the radical left by definition
you say either i say either you say progressive i say liberal i accept that ina venn diagram there will be some progressives who are not liberals and some liberals who are not progressives but the overlap would be huge
so this article is saying women feel insecure around maps and brilliant men because of mean or inappropriate things that men tell them men should be more sensitive and openly encourage women to read maps and get brilliant im trying to figure out why the observation regarding female insecurity about maps and brilliance fit into the rest of the narrative
theres a difference between giving a nonjudgemental description of someone and a bitchy one
thats the entire magazine youve linked to its paywalled the full article is there though read it all ut googling the original article that there was a physical altercation is particularly relevant here cctv footage that showed our alterca tion had been no more than an insignificant skirmish still the police investigated my case with ardour the investigating officers florid report to the cps made it sound as if id beaten the hell out of the guy it was nonsense nevertheless charges were duly pressed f or  months i stood accused of a hate crime homophobically motivat ed common assault the british trans port police pursued my case with extraordi nary zeal so too did the crown prosecution service i was plunged into a world where common sense withered and died someone had dialled  the guard arrived and i returned to my seat the entire altercation lasted about  seconds the train halted at tunbridge wells a police officer took our statements separately and informed me that my accuser didnt want to press charges nor did i he got off the train i continued my journey and that was the end of it or so i thought  a day later a british transport police officer rang my adversary who turned out to be a university lecturer for reasons i will never know this call led to a change of heart by my accuser the btp subsequently interviewed me and before i knew what had happened i was being accused of homopho bic abuse and assault i was stunned i had allegedly interrupted the mans attempts to make a phone call by asking him if he was ringing his gay lover
listening doesnt always mean theyre right i grew up with the kind of people who voted brexit they were my family and my neighbours i listened to plenty of what they had to say about immigrants poofs and stuckup people who think theyre better than the rest of us that last included me because i went to university i dont agree with them and i dont feel that knowing they say that means that i have to advocate that point of view i listen to all sides including muchderided experts and draw my own conclusions exercising my alleged right to be offensive for a moment the country is currently in thrall to the kind of twonker who goes on holiday to spain and will only eat fried fish and chips
jtstone youre right that its in part down to whether or not one is prepared to learn the skills no not in part in whole you cannot expect to have any skill whatsoever in any given area if you simply dont bother to learn it and what people think about you or say about you is utterly irrelevant
the difference between the hurt experienced whilst being insulted and developing cancer through second hand smokebeing the victim of a drunk driver are obvious to most strange that you would conflate the two to make a point
she is simply a victim of your patriarchal tyranny she has clearly internalised your misogyny you heteronormative white cis monster
there is a difference between being personally offensive youre so gay and offending your sensibilities homosexuality is wrong you might not agree with the statements but the former is not ok the latter is fine
offence complainants are often more offended than the targets themselves imho like volunteer mr angrys stepping in to offer assistance it is as insulting to be called out as a target group of vulnerable little snowflakes when most people can well stand their own ground and give back as much if not more than they are given perhaps the insults are not intended to reach any further than the front line of overly liberalminded people who falsely believe they are acting and thinking for the rest
there are people out there that have forgotten more about the topics you claim to know about than you will ever know this sondes like microaggression
society will never be perfect but by and large weve rubbed along ok these last few hundred years without widespread discord and have never allowed fascism to seriously take root look at the battle of cable street for example or the way pretty well every edl rally finds itself opposed by a counterdemonstration or the mass protests against donald trumps travel ban we dont like fascism in this country we as a people are quite a tolerant lot despite what the postreferendum doom mongers would have you believe were not perfect as ive already said but neither are we so far gone in our fascist tendencies that we require government to regulate our thoughts for us were perfectly capable of regulating ourselves
yes i think thats a real problem too
i think we should resist the conflation of words and actions in an extremely small number of circumstances speech can cause physical harm and should not be allowed or more accurately it should be punished kill x or x should be killed is the sort of thing that should not be tolerated basically everything else should be allowed people who want to conflate words with violence do so in order to justify violence against their political enemies a paper such as the guardian should be firmly against this
has anyone actually had that conversation about the gay gordon
as a regular poster and a long time supporter of brexit i have not only read many articles in the guardian saying i am a racist stupid not educated then of course there was a really worrying story in the telegraph this week from a student who is studying at a major university and came across posters from staff that right supporting students need to be dealt with then there are of course the comments section
not at all fatty
were currently in the midst of something of a backlash against political correctness well form me this would happen if the actually very ethical and principled pc is being used to silence discussion and debate by declaring certain ideas offlimits and doing so primarily because those ideas would not survive scrutiny i am thinking of religious precepts primarily some of which are monstrous and yet all of which are cunningly and wrongly attributed to a divine something thta must never be questioned
once upon a time sticks and stones wouldnt break my bones but now they devastate me
i give you milo yiannopoulosfirst off i will be clear hes a toolfirst of all no one outside the dingbat breitbart world of conspiracy theory had ever heard of him until he got shunted off twitter for being supposedly racist only he wasnt he was unpleasant and vaguely offensive about the ghostbusters film and nastily sexist in a tool shock jock way but he said nothing racist others did but not him but the snowflake brigade made such a big hooha about being offended that he was banned from twitter and suddenly everyone knew who he was and he got oodles of publicitythen the lefty brigade got all upset again and started throwing massive hissy fits to get him shutdown from speaking thereby massively increasing his kudos with the dingbats making him known to an audience hed hitherto only dreamed of reaching and also showing the left to be a bunch of censorious snowflakes who turn authoritarian because they think they are right and the master race and therefore only they should speaki wont even go into the fucking remain campaign im still in shock
its funny that white male always gets written alongside classprivileged in these kinds of opinion articles poor white men just do not seem to exist on their radar thats a microaggression in of itself one that ripples out across society so that white men are seen as legitimate victims regardless of their actual status or vulnerability im a women and im feminist i think there are still many issues women need to fight for to get equality but im sick and tired of this white male bashing its nasty its ubiquitous and it does have real world consequences for people
her rationale behind calling him out on that made perfect sense i thought
by the time peoplepoliticians could challange mass immigration without being called racist it was too late thats why we are in this position now its not that challenging immigration is racist its that traditionally only racists used to challenge immigration you are right that the situation has changed but not in the way you think
but what to do freedom of speech is the first and foremost freedom even if you have to put up with the trolls keep calling them out though abi
i am a white middle class male heterosexual english chap living in indonesia i am a bit aged retired and inclined to avoid arguments by nodding and smiling in such a convincingly senile manner that i hope most people are coming round to the conclusion that i am senilethat is the only people i have ever felt inclined to insult are people like me white european expats to the extent that i avoid their company like i would avoid people carrying bird flu i therefore remain uninsulted and uninsulting life is good without my own kind in it i do not unconditionally believe that all those others local sorts are perfect nor is their culture and society without fault but they are much nicer than my own kind if only because i find even after over thirty years association their languages are far too difficult to be struggled with uncommunicative uncommunicating uninsulted as far as i am aware i would recommend leaving the west to anyone fed up with struggling around pc etc bugger off i say
struggling to see
youve let your assumptions run away with themselves there i didnt offer a solution purely pointed out that history has shown many times that ideas words written down whilst not doing harm in themselves do inevitably lead to it the crime is not the thought but the action although if ideas can be defeated before they become crimes they should without banning a single word of a single book
words can do all kinds of harm and sometimes need to be controlled careerdamaging libel for one thing severe bullying for another the question is what do we restrict
you can say what ever you want if you offend someone dont be surprised when people get angry thats it but that is not it is it luke i know you post on some similar topics to me so even though we disagree on most things you can not deny there is a double work even here at what people say is the haven of political correctness you know you can say things about certain groups of people that i could not say about other groups of people that i am not allowed to name in a article such as this which in itself says something no political correctness as humourless language policing is an idea so normalised that blatantly racist sexist ableist and homophobic slurs can be protected under the rubric of free speech it has become banal and even tyrannical to try to argue for language and behaviour that respects women and minorities i agree completely with the journalist here and this is something i argue against in the comment section something that some of the journalists colleagues do not seem to wish to acknowledge or deal with when it happens to arabs or muslims however much one shoves their faces in it makes you wonder
many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please no no we cannot have people saying what they please nor thinking what they please they must only say that which pleases those making such strenuous efforts to tell us all how to think unfairness to anyone is hideous racism is hideous stupid and intolerable but do we want a world in which you can never be sure that anyone saying this really means it or is just afraid of the vilification that would otherwise come down on them
 would do it has a story and deals with exactly the point at hand
as a black man with white relations i always wonder why people using the word cracker are never brought to bookjust because your a minority does not mean you cannot be racist peopel are too damn sensitive these days of all colours and cree as for yasmin alibhaibrown i notice you left out him saying he would either suffer a brain haemorrhage to end up punching her in the throat just like the endless threats to michael gove it was not meant as a threat grow up
youve missed the posters point entirely could have set my watch that this response of yours would surface quaint
he was defending someone making a comment whilst drunk which that someone later regretted ive heard a lot of people of colour make horrible racist remarks women being openly misogynist and nasty comments about disabled people by black white male female on another comments section on this website people are actually defending abu qatada i had the misfortune to hear one of his speeches he sounded lije a nazi
actually the fag connotation was rather well explained by south parkit has a number of meanings and unless you know for sure the person is gay it doesnt have to always be viewed as a homophobic slur but as long as its predominantly known as such most people will take it as being a homophobic slur anyway baldwin used it along with other references to sexuality so his meaning was clear
good manners will cover a lot of ground
its a bit difficult to take seriously anyone who uses a word like ableist in their argument
i called a lunchtime supervisor a dinner lady on an other forum i was given a right mauling and rightly so to hangs head in shame
well speaking as someone who is gay the word has never really bothered me i view it as an insult one that seems to be aimed at many different people for many different reasons
damn straight he isisnt
not to mention hiring the mangalores to destroy the mondoshawans spaceship so the great evil could destroy the earth
questions about this are now coming from mainstream folk not extreme anything i long for the day the debate is unleashed
heres the thing thirty or forty years ago concepts like sexism and racism were genuinely revelatory alerting us all to the way prejudice works and the effects it has sadly their function has been hijacked such that they are used to close down any discussion of the malignant aspects of any culture see islamophobia coined by the muslim brotherhood precisely for this reason and are widely misused or used selectively eg so that women can make wild generalisations about male sexism generalisations that are themselves sexist even in the early days it was evident that pc was deployed snobbishly to declare a persons superiority to the commonality i alone see the vicious prejudice you are demonstrating nowadays the irreflective use of these terms sexism racism etc is often the sign of an individual who hasnt thought an issue through a charitable way of describing a moron the fact that the egregious sepp blatter who heads up one of the most corrupt entities in the world fifa can use racist to label his critics tells us all we need to know about the way the term has been evacuated of all meaning oldman is a genuinely wonderful actor and should be celebrated as such but his comments are poorly articulated offensive and sensational nonetheless one cant really argue against his assertion that too many of the most pc are hypocritical not to say overly pious who amongst us has not made a generalisation about a nation or group that might be deemed discriminatory anyone who has some experience of life will defend to the death hisher right to make distinctions between say the italians and the germansand some will prefer the values of the former and some the values of the latter so what
i dont believe that you should live your life akin to manoeuvring a minefield desperately trying to avoid contentious issues or points at which people may become offended yet we should all also be civilised and courteous enough not to have to abuse our fellow human the line in the sand should come from within those who transgress can be ostracised and ignored this is why i dont think its a good thing griffin and farage and worse using sanitised confusing language to put their policies across if they openly come out and stated their beliefs in the most caustic way possible we would all be able to see them for what they really are but because of all this media trained nonsense they are able to trick people more often than not with cases like this it is false orchestrated outrage generated by the media who is truly offended by what he is supposed to have said who is really sat at home head in hands ahh i really liked him as commissioner gordon and he has to go and say that just mark him off as an idiot in your mental rolodex and move on if he really said it that is dont be offended by silly things like this life is too short it is a million miles away from a sickening facetoface verbal assault in a pub backed with bile and hatred something that i would like to think would be snuffed out by those in attendance in most places in the uk these days anyway
political correctness is basically just cultural marxism the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms what a load of clickbait bollocks for the reactionary right to salivate over political correctness just means civility respect etc specifically pertaining to how you talk write about peoples characteristics they have no control over ie race gender and sexuality
funny that despite constant vigilance from the pc brigade many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please so your intentions are clear you do desire to control peoples language and thoughts this is why there is a backlash against the destructive politically correct culture we have
we like nonconformists who go against the grain they are the reason for a lot of positive changes progressive people like but to draw a line in the sand and say that is approved behaviour that is not approved is just asking to be subverted folk such as liddle have become the new antiestablishment daring to push against the ceiling
what on earth are you talking about do you even know what cultural marxism means
give people the freedom to say what they want and they probably will feel less repressed and probably more civil what like in the good old days when people would commonly use words like wog and coon in public without batting an eyelid you might think thats a civil way to behave but i doubt many nonwhite people do
many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please completely untrue oldman sincerely apologized michael fabricant sincerely apologized and james delingpole doesnt matter he runs along behind every non pc scandal like a yapping fucking terrier and wants to be regarded as controversial when hes too dull to be anything other than james delingpole please stop giving him the publicity he craves like some big brother reject one of the bestloved tv and most successful presenters in the country muttered the nword in a nonbroadcast recording there was widespread outrage and he nearly lost his job the idea that the antipc brigade have won and many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please is like the flipside of the daily mails assertion that the pc brigade have won and you cant say anything any more neither of them are true
i dont think that it is only middle aged men just often in my experience perhaps a generational thing i dont know but ive met people we would describe as un pc all over the world equally i have met people all over the world who arent some people are just racist their colour or nationality is secondary to that just because others do it i still believe we are right to aspire to not be like that
last week mp michael fabricant joked about punching the commentator yasmin alibhaibrown the following night on channel  news the journalist james delingpole referring to a woman well into her sixties as a girl found it astonishing that alibhaibrown had turned a tweet that was mildly unflattering into a threat i note you neglect to point out that alibhaibrown proceeded to imagine what michael fabricant wouldd think of her because of the fact that he is a white male tory one could be forgiven for assuming that that sort of prejudice is acceptable in your book the right has consistently trounced political correctness but many adept rightwing politicians regularly use it to their advantage nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive lola what exactly are you arguing here then either politically correct language is useful in which case we should use it or it isnt in which case we shouldnt you start off making a case for it and finish off making a case against it from here it only appears that you just dont like the way some people think
httpwwwplayboycomplaygroundviewgaryoldmanplayboyinterviewpage
laughter is an adaptation which is largely triggered after we realize our anxiety is unwarranted curiously the more sensitivity that is bred into us the finer the eggshells we must walk around each other the more impact a comedians show which showcases antipc content becomes we laugh at antipc commentary it triggers unwarranted anxiety its really a testament to how uncomfortable people feel around each other below their visage often comfort is demonstrated through sarcasm patronizing each other if you dont feel comfortable being w sarcasm w a person its because you dont feel comfortable w that person
quite so but we do seem to spend vastly more time discussing such fuel than we do focussing on the actual fire a jewish cemetery is vandalised and while the bbc news website may write it up its unlikely to be appearing on the national news any time soon whereas michael fabricants tweet got an entire segment to itself on channel  news ed miliband claimed to be horrified by the latter im pretty sure he wasnt im pretty sure also that he would be genuinely horrified by the former as would most people but all the while were considering jokes made in poor taste to be the principal threat to society were unlikely to find out because all those people wont be hearing anything about it
whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense not among decent people it isnt conflating this entirely reasonable condemnation with the silly term political correctness thus giving the hard of thinking a label to attack you with is the real problem here i dont think it is politically correct to condemn racism or homophobia that implies you do it out of some sort of phoney expedience i think it is morally correct behaviour
people lose their jobs because their bosses realize what ass holes they are if you are an obnoxious person and rude youll find it that most people dont like you even if you wont break pc rulesif youll keep coming on your colleagues menwomen youll find it they dont like you as well be nice and people will be nice to you
actually the fag connotation was rather well explained by south parkit has a number of meanings and unless you know for sure the person is gay it doesnt have to always be viewed as a homophobic slur but of course the media has nothing better to do than to jump on soundbites a celebrity said instead of reporting the real news the main attraction is distraction once again inequality between the rich and the poor is the gateway to racismprejudiceantisemitism etcbut the divide and conquer tactics of the media always talking about the symptoms but never the cause
these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman stop right there he didnt say anything of the kind
we need a thought and speech police to deal with these people with huge fines for minor transgressions and up to  years in a special reeducation centre for a major one justice should be dispenced in special pc courts before a commitee of judges from the efnic minorities that should stop the nazi swine
it doesnt matter how you look when people want to make others feel bad or express anger at them they pick the most obvious thing to insult its just like children in a playground yeh but these are adults cant we expect grown up behaviour from them
does anyone remember the furore over jade goody on big brother later that same year jermaine jackson was guest of honour at a hope not hate campaign organised by the daily mirror not a soul mentioned that while on big brother he referred to jade goodys mother as white trashnot so long ago a white radical left a severed pigs head outside a mosque and received three months jail a muslim radical burned a poppy wreath on remembrance sunday and received a  fine he afterwards joked about it being less than a parking fine tony parsons might have defected to the sun but he made a comment which has stayed in my mind heartless cowardly racist scum come in all colours we choose to ignore this
someone used a word i dont like i demand action now words dont diminish anyones equality and its extremely disingenuous to suggest that they do yes racists and homophobes and misogynists use certain words in order to offend but slurs are frequently and successfully reclaimed obviously any problem that does exist is about context and not content
i would rather people say what is in their minds and then we know where we stand with them and then work on the underlying prejudice i see what youre saying but i suppose it depends on what you think is achievable i dont think i can make the world like me and others similar to me but i find the world a better more welcoming place if theyre not going to make that obviously clear
your right often the correct term would be sophistry for the shouting down of debate and individuals
i dont think political correctness to be upset about racial slurs political correctness is when you have liberal halfwits saying that islam is religion of peace even when the evidence is contrary
yes but oldman didnt put it like the way that he made his point was indeed clumsy and could have been worded much better it is very disappointing that you have used ation marks around individual words like faggot and nigger in a manner that is very much out of context with what he actually said just so that you can further your argument personally i think that political correctness is a great thing the problem as usual comes when people take things to the extreme and twist the sentiment andor the words that come out of an individuals mouth both sides do this and i think lolo okolosie is a little bit guilty of it here
the left or progressives or those who oppose hate speech put themselves onto a losing path when they coined or since this is debatable failed to reject utterly the phrase politically correct in the first place political correctness as a phrase represents a hideous orthodoxy which for anyone opposing hate speech should be anathema i dont oppose racist words and attitudes because the prevailing political climate have said so i oppose those things because they are fucking wrong what does a concept of pc do that right and wrong doesnt the problem is that people who have bad attitudes or say and do racist things can be conflated far too easily with nonconformists who go against the grain we like nonconformists who go against the grain they are the reason for a lot of positive changes progressive people like but to draw a line in the sand and say that is approved behaviour that is not approved is just asking to be subverted take away the fallacy of political correctness and leave right and wrong that is wrong the nonconformist who goes against the grain questions this but has as sense of right and wrong so if the concept that something is wrong stands up to scrutiny its accepted referring to black people by a range of historic slurs is wrong feel like rebelling against that then youre a dick these principles take away the false respectability of the politically incorrect when we just mean some reactionary arsehole but confers the valid respectability of the politically incorrect person who challenges existing political orthodoxy when its wrong like when gay marriage was illegal when unequal pay for women was acceptable where that leaves us is that we need to be grown up and make moral judgements about speech rather than falling into the trap some progressives and left leaning people fall into of relying on lists of approved words and concepts on topic mel gibson might have argued his rant against jews was out of character but the context of some of his other work and views went against him alec baldwin was wrong to call someone a fag but i can accept that what he said was out of character and under stress he should still apologise but mainly to gay people for equating all those fine upstanding homosexuals with some scumbag paparazzo progress will be when you want to insult someone who happens to be gay for being unpleasant to him in some way and the worst insult you can think of is to call him a gibson
excessive pc is like those who blame health and safety for everything
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense its sort of like how antisemitism camouflaged as antizionism has become the narrative of the hard left when it used to be the exclusive domain of the right impolite to have mentioned that perhaps but true none the less
i would agree with you if someone issued a rude rebuke to you hey even a mob on the internet or in personal letters but people lose their jobs and are effectively blacklisted
and then is marched out to apologise on national tv ironically his original point was that people especially the press dont let context colour how the words are used any more am fully aware of the context and i dont think what he said was something to applaud
i totally agree that what he said was wrong and he should  apologise for what he said what i dont agree with is that he should apologise for what people think he said
good article reminds me of a line from stewart lees show on political correctnessyou cant even write racial abuse in excrement on someones car without the politically correct brigade jumping down your throat
our world has gone to hell declared gary oldman in a recent interview with playboy magazine these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman its considered bad form to name women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts and when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots what or who can we blame for this awful state of affairs gary political correctness and the liberal dictatorship of course that entire opening paragraph is structured in a way to make it appear as if hes complaining he cant say those things this was not what he said in the actual interview which youve pointed out what he said was bad and he should apologise for that not for what people think he said
the problem with all these societally enforced mores is the fact they mask the reality and dont deal with the real issue its like putting lipstick on a pig please dont condemn me for my non pc discrimination against pigs people can say all the right things but harbor very different attitudes i would rather people say what is in their minds and then we know where we stand with them and then work on the underlying prejudice
post of the decade
i have always said that people who blame political correctness do not understand political correctness
im all for political correctness as many other posters have pointed out it is with some exceptions just a case of being polite what i object to is the lack of policing of the other side of the coin namely the faux outrage expressed at some comment or other which is completely out of context with what has been said more often than not this is driven by a dislike of the individual rather than anything they said and further it normally involves deliberately misinterpreting what has actually been said to my mind this is just as if not more offensive
more to the point yab was able to commandeer the full force of the law and spur birmingham city council into instant action to have that tory counsellor loose his job all because he hurt her feelings we a tweet about having her stoned now heres the crux she is routinely just as vile about others such as clarkson yet most of us do not enjoy her access to such asymmetric power
and context is everything
its either pc gone mad or someone complaining about how you cant say x any more before going on to say just that and then is marched out to apologise on national tv ironically his original point was that people especially the press dont let context colour how the words are used any more
bullshit its just politeness and respect for others cultural marxism good grief
putting it in context doesnt make it better its really uncool to say all that especially in an interview behind closed doors with your mates fine say what you like we all do
hes bemoaning the negative reactions that come as a result of saying these things though i didnt read okolosie as saying he wanted the right to say these things personally and i think her larger points do fit in with what he said and complained of
well what he said was still pretty awful theres a fine line that hes on there i almost see the point hes trying to make but its worded so badly that all people like the blogger here can see are the trigger words this then causes them to project their own opinion of what he said conflating it into a totally different issue than the one that should be addressed rather than saying no gary you really shouldnt be sticking up for the people saying that shit we now have gary oldman is saying this shit
it takes more than a change of words to eradicate bigotry the pc movement has been of benefit to those who felt demeaned by certain vocabulary such vocabulary was used in many cases by people who were sincerely unaware of its potentially insulting nature as with such movements though some things went too far and rightly attracted ridicule i am disturbed by the effect that sexneutralism has had on linguistic usage sometimes the sexneutral singular they is a good choice but sometimes it is used unnecessarily and the result can be silly or ugly i once read the following for example the delegate sitting next to me put up their hand and said in such a context there is nothing unpc about identifying the sex of the person concerned and yet this they usage has become a ritual with some people that they cannot break even when they should
you dont understand what cultural marxism is it isnt the conspiracy theory dreamt up by us rightwingers cultural marxism is actually closer to a libertarian view of what culture should be do some research
but there are reasons why you wouldnt be so rude or offensive down the pub consequences none of the es that oldman complained about were made in the context of being criminalised for saying them but instead of the adverse reactions that the speaker got for saying them liberty and free speech does not dictate that you can say what you want without people reacting negatively to them or it being consequence free
in other words what he said really wasnt that awful but because he is gary oldman and famous we have to have our dog and pony show
its being presented in a different context though he didnt say when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots he said he understood why baldwin did it those are two totally different sentiments hes still wrong but hes not bemoaning his inability to run down canal street yelling faggot at everyone
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures okey dokey go read some books yknow the ones that arent just stories it might help you think about things in a bit more depth or would that be a bit too intellectual for you
its ok to state there arent enough black faces at the bbc ok to say too many public school whites but not ok to explore why it is one particular group have achieved such overwhelming celebrity success there
bring him everyone
maybe i do feel that pc is abused to prevent criticising the agenda of some people its far easier to shout racist or fascist when losing the debate
meantime london medics confirmed today that jimmy saville is still dead
does anyone have the full interviewa poster further down shows that much of what oldman has said is taken out of context not in the order he expressed it in support of a different opionion than this blogger is implying in short pretty badly misrepresented
i thing the recent success of ukip is precisely because the pc brigade went too far in their lecturing ordinary people could no longer express strongly held views without being labelled racist putting a label on someone does not change their views it only makes them feel they have no right to free speech any discussion on islamic extremist is a good example of this why should be have to pussyfoot our way around the feelings of people who in turn hate all infidels and want to convert them give people the freedom to say what they want and they probably will feel less repressed and probably more civil
using or condoning racist language is wrong that isnt the same as someone being obnoxious though fabricant and delingpole were being obnoxious yes its a bit silly to throw fabricant and delingpole into the mix niether was being racist they were venting their understandable irritation at the antics of yasmin alibhaibrown on channel  news they did so in a rude and obnoxious way cerainly but there was nothing racist about it
oh gary oldman one of my favourite actors i wonder why he is in the ne oh god no he said what oh flip look freedom of speech dictates that we have the freedom to speak right right however the freedom to speak comes with the personal responsibility that if you say something that is upsetting or offensive people will get upset and take offence and use their own freedom of speech to say so whether that be a random person on twitter a celebrity a newspaper pundit a child an adult an oap our words can be widely publicised within minutes of them being said or typed in this era of social media and selfcensoring or just being aware of the language you use to make your point is a necessary skill its not censoring saying something the same but using different words is not censoring censoring is not allowing you to say it at all for example replace gary oldman is an outoftouch idiot with gary oldman has obviously not kept up with language evolution these past thirty years and should probably do his research before opening his mouth in interviews likewise you can say i am concerned about extremist muslims in britain and would like to discuss this rather than swearing and using a string of racial slurs its staggering the number of people usually celebrities who say something that they know is offensive it doesnt matter how far removed from reality you are you know words like the n or cword will offend someone dont recognise that freedom of speech does not protect them from backlash thats why its a beautiful thing everybody can have their say over an issue even if their say is deemed morally right or wrong by society at large bleh
well yeah thats kinda my point he said some pretty awful things in defence of people who said even worse things but hes not bemoaning not being able to say these things which this blogger seems to want it to be about
good piece but the real enemy is the economically correct brigade whove been justifying the mass larceny that is neoliberalism for too long now
but to present what this blog did as es which were in no way es of his is just as bad in my view theyre es of his to the extent he said them in the way that okolosie reports he did ie in the context of what you cannot get away with saying now
the argument goes that offensive language is so because those taking offence choose to equality therefore is the right to demean and abuse minorities if the fancy takes you no thats not right the argument is that liberty therefore is the right to demean and abuse whoever you want its unpleasant but its also right curb speech and you do curb freedoms thats irretrievable i think this is why institutionalised political correctness is mistrusted but it isnt in personal life noone would be that rude or offensive down the pub thats a choice not a restriction to lash out against
i think the justifications and supportive arguments behind political correctness have become increasingly academic and so its harder for people to connect and empathise with it and there are a lot of instances of political correctness being enforced to the point of the ridiculous and thats affected how many people regard the pc lexicon primarily in a negative sense so yes i agree with okolosies notion that pc language has become a villanised vocabulary if you will but perhaps true bigots are taking advantage of normal peoples jaded attitude towards it
the point being though what he said was bad you dont need to go to the trouble of trying to make it worse because it then seems like youre trying to blow it out of proportion why go through the trouble of inventing fake essentiment when there was already a lot wrong with what he said in the interview
only middle aged white men can be antipc youll never hear a black man or jew making jokes about other races of course not people with colour in their skin are better like that apparently
any argument from oldman that mel gibson was the victim of the old political correctness gone mad trope would clearly be nonsensical what gibson said wasnt a case of your gran saying something a bit outdated because she knows no better but of a man who really should know better going on a vicious rant about a whole set of people at the same time since language does shape perceptions of the world we live in we should have the right to challenge it so it might sometimes though not in this case be that political correctness goes too far god knows there are enough instances on here of people being called racist or misogynist on pretty flimsy evidence take each case as we find it
the morality police also forget that generally people just insult what is in front of them i know plenty of people who work in environments where verbal abuse is common if you are fat then you are called fatty if you are black you get called a nigger if you are brown you get called a paki if you wear glasses you are called foureyes if you are a skinny women you are either anorexic or some threat of sexual abuse if you look like one type of guy you get called a pedo and if you look like another type of guy you get called gay if you have ginger hair people will ask after your pubes and make other ginger jokes it doesnt matter how you look when people want to make others feel bad or express anger at them they pick the most obvious thing to insult its just like children in a playground and should not be taken as some political point
it doesnt fit the agendaso never mind the context just selective e and paraphase to support the conceit
i have to say that having gone back and watched the alibhaibrownliddle interview they both struck me as being as bad as each other at the end theyd been reduced to simply emphasising how much they hated each other how kathy newman sat there i dont know she should have snuck out sealed the studio and left them to argue it out ad infinitum oldman has gone down a lot in my estimation as a result of this once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures believing in equality and the fundamental changes that are required to realise it means working on ourselves as individuals at the level of language and the institutions that sustain our unequal society simply minding your words isnt enough and when we say it is we leave the values of the term open to lip service hear hear
for calling someone a faggot you have to actually believe that someones homosexuality is wrong the intent of the person using it if it is being used as a slur is irrelevant whether you think homosexuality is wrong or youre just using it as a convenient slur the effect on the person receiving the insult is the same if one genuinely doesnt believe homophobia racism etc is wrong dont use homophobic racist slurs etc if you think gay men marrying women and then realizing they are gay and leaving their wife is a wrong thing you can only criticize gay men qua gay men as if they werent gay they would not do that particular thing and if you cant criticise that without using words like faggot no one will ever believe that youre not homophobic
surely he cant be sirius maybe he said it with a smiley on his face
but to present what this blog did as es which were in no way es of his is just as bad in my view facts are sacred except inconvenient ones
nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive so maybe its time to focus on actions and intentions rather than words lots of unacceptable speech is couched in acceptable terms until those terms cease to be acceptable it doesnt help to change spastic to downs to special nor handicapped to disabled to differently able if the sentiment behind the words is still offensive similarly its perfectly reasonable to assume people will use the wrong word without any malice until we focus on what the racist means when he says african american he might just as well be saying nigger
our world has gone to hell well said gary
and with a seriously dodgy accent
yep right on bloggers who take specific words and inject what they think the person who said them meant rather than actually using full es is what he said excusable no not really but did he actually say what this blogger is claiming no he didnt
youre against both racism and not being racist
and the pronoun for god should be sheheit
presentiment bloody predictive text
i didnt think that it matters because man always refers to men now its not an important point but ill be quiet now
keep your hand on your hapenny cover it well with your palm keep your hand on your hapenny and molly will come to no harm
but the whole point of the definition of mansplaining is that the man doesnt know as much as the woman no it doesnt mansplain manˈspleɪn verbinformal gerund or present participle mansplaining of a man explain something to someone typically a woman in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing no mention there about relative levels of knowledge anything else comes under the heading a reasonable attempt to help so why wouldnt man explaining something be covered by that
you may find the stable door can now be effectively closed but unfortunately the mare or stallion has bolted the important thing is to continue to permit ourselves the delicious satisfaction of presenting our rudimentary observations as erudite presentment through judicious use of a thesaurus accompanied by context free statistics with reference to less marketable news stories
its even more dangerous for their credibility when said people also write things like this i think its better to refrain from pronouncing the hypotheticals you create inside your own mind as some kind of cogent argument or fact you add nothing and merely expose the depth of your prejudice
can you list the possible contexts yes thanks for your input youre welcome
do you want to start a competition comparing those words which reflect badly on men and those which reflect badly on women i wonder which list would be longer
im in two minds about whether male and female consciousness is fundamentally different what i would say though is that if it is culturally entrenched then the gendered identities that exist at the moment have been entrenched over millenia therefore the idea that we just change some of the words we use and patriarchy collapses in a few decades is absurd we may have a completely different gendered culture in  years time but that cant be forced and it will evolve naturally neither men nor women are ready to entirely break with the gendered nature of who they are yet and i dont think its fair to expect men to think of their masculinity however you want to define that as some form of sociopathy which they should be able to divest like a suit of clothes while women still get to celebrate their femininity if they want to thats just tantamount to saying that women get to shop for the bits of patriarchy they like while men shoulder all the blame i know women have a hard time in lots of ways and there are all sorts of arseholes around who think theyre just bits of meat to satisfy male desires but equally things are not good for men at the moment the economy is being feminised theyre underachieving academically record numbers are killing themselves and are on the streets what are men supposed to be at the moment and now many women arent economically dependent on men anymore which is of course a good thing what is the nature of the heterosexual compact does anyone know no wonder everyones turning gay heterosexuality is a fucking horrible mess all assertions of female sexuality are look liberating but any advance from a man is seen as suspect even though many womenbstill want men to pursue them at the same time you have feminists attacking a culture of objectification while embracing hookup sex and claiming to be empowered by dressing like sluts all these crazy contradictions its absurd you have people like miley cyrus dressing the way they do completely having embraced the politics of sexual capitalism and then complainng when it blows up in their faces i think chrissie hynde got a load of flack for suggesting that if there is a porn culture millennial women share some responsibility for it there has to come a point where you say if you dont want to be viewed as a sexual object dont present yourself as one you cant pout with your cleavage out on facebook or whatever and then complain that youre objectified women arent children they have a degree of choice and responsibility and as for rapeif course we should do everything we can to my nimise and punish what us an evil but we cant just socially engineer these dark impulses out of humanity shouldnt we be telling young women that very unfortunately it is a fact of reality in our society and helping them to learn to protect themselves just wanted expecting it to vanish is ridiculous
right off the top revisionist history you say feminists used to insist that there were no essential differences between men and women i was there and its just not true it may only be revisionist if your experience was universal i was there too and i knew feminists who argued that beyond the reproductive biology there were no essential differences between men and women even to the extent that differences in physical build and strength were a product of social conditioning
but do british parents actually teach their kids thats its ok to call it a fanny theyre happy for their sons to talk about their willies but i suspect that fanny is often regarded as a naughty word
similarly itll be affected by the fact that recruitment panels tend to select people who are like them so it selfperpetuates and we end up with extrovert male ceos how is this supported by the pretty much gender neutral hiring of said panels up to around age  supported by ons stats showing on average pretty much equal pay to that point in full time work why would only ceo amp board member hiring panels suddenly decide they want people like us after having not done so as they came up through the ranks especially when its coincidentally around that time that the many women taking maternity leave and changing they job role andor hours to accommodate having and looking after children starts to have a big effect
pot meet kettle honestly read some of your own posts
in what context can you list the possible contexts so i can select the correct one you may want him to but whether he needs to is up to him thanks for your input
what proportion of the englishspeaking world do you think considers man to refer to men and not women in what context if b gt a then you need to shush you may want him to but whether he needs to is up to him
could i also refer readers to httponlineslangdictionarycomthesauruswordsmeaningvulvavaginafemalegenitaliahtml lots of em there 
hes correct and you havent made anything approaching an arguing nor even an attempt to refute what hes said
my male friends do that to me all the time if i go to tell a story before i even get a chance they but in with their own story before i have a chance to tell mine its most infurating especially as theyre in total denial about it i bet they all listen quietly and patiently when its one of them starting to tell a story right no butting in at all then all say after you no after you to find out who goes next unless you try to speak in which case they all jump in with their story how do they decide who gets to tell the story between them with them all being interrupting blokes
bags i number 
to be fair my girlfriend also claims everything is the fault of the patriarchy like stubbing her toe or when it rains i am not entirely sure she is taking modern feminism very seriously
indeed guess who in the past complained about hurricanes always been named after women
nah its cetainly not exclusive to scotlandmy friend and i favour lily which is short feminine flowery and rhymes with willy but thats ours you cant have it
right off the top revisionist history you say feminists used to insist that there were no essential differences between men and women i was there and its just not true before second wave feminism became fragmented the feminists i read and knew werent saying that there is no essential difference between men and women what we were saying is that there should be equality of opportunity for everyone regardless of gender race sexual orientation religion etc equality of opportunity is not the same as fortunately
i think mansplaining is usually used to refer to one of a man explaining to a woman as if imparting a fact something that is actually a matter of opinion and so not a factual issue at all eg an opinion on brexit a man explaining to a woman a fact or facts that the woman is betterplaced to know eg a male student repeatedly correcting their female lecturer
a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way thats nonclinical
i concede i was being ever so slightly factitious
so if your girlfriend is saying your manterrupting and you want to stay in a relationship with her maybe listen to what shes saying so based on what appears to be your own very limited anecdotal experience the only possible explanation or outcome here is that elgrecoandros is at fault and thereby needs to get his act together it couldnt possibly be a logic fail on the part of the girlfriend
the word man was not originally exclusive to males the original usage may not be in use now but to say that for example mankind is sexist shows an ignorance of how such a word came to mean anything at all what proportion of the englishspeaking world do you think knows about the etymological origins of man lets call that percentage a what proportion of the englishspeaking world do you think considers man to refer to men and not women lets call that percentage b if b gt a then you need to shush
notallfeminism theres probably an article by mahdawi herself about how the notall argument as in notallmen no longer works and died a death eg as the twitter version of no true scotsman
but the whole point of the definition of mansplaining is that the man doesnt know as much as the woman anything else comes under the heading a reasonable attempt to help some men not all men assume that they know more than any woman does about some subjects but dont assume that they know more than any man does and so talk to men and women differently about those subjects if ive already explained that ive got twenty years of experience using a particular piece of software its unlikely that its ok to assume that i need its basic functionality explaining to me but my colleague who is  years younger with me and has said hes just learning it can be treated as knowledgeable
you hear quite a lot of bollocks in the graun that you dont hear anywhere else yes you do and its passed off as commonplace ive never heard anyone use this kind of terminology as part of their language i didnt know what the term mansplaining meant until someone on cif told me a while ago all of these words sound like the kind people in the media might use even writing articles about them or arseholes who are attempting to express themselves via in some instances a pseudomeaningful verbal shorthand
perhaps it too late now but perhaps have a conversation with your sons about what they mean when they use words like femanazi as its a word usually used to demean feminism its usually used to demean a certain type of feminism one which is offensive often aggressively antimale and sexist hence the nazi addition to distinguish the target from feminists and consquently used by people who would prefer to see women subjugated its frankly utterly shallow and sexist thinking to assume that someone using the word feminazi would prefer to see women subjugated this type of dishonest unevidenced other than the use of certain words deliberate misinterpretation or outright invention of thinking in others is one of the reason politics is in such a mess perhaps a bit too late now but perhaps ask your kids to explain to you the issue of thinking you can infer from the simple use of a word you dislike that they would prefer women are subjugated your assumption that its only sons who need such a conversation demonstrates the sexism in your views there are plenty of females who have similar views of feminism and are distancing themselves from the description due in no small part to views such as you express
lets abolish he and she and refer to everyone as it then the transinterneopartiallycisungendered would all be on an equal footing and we could all be its we could all have numbers as well instead of names so there would be no possibility of anyone having a male or female name and anyone could be fluid etc etc etc
yep indeed so but i also had it explained to me as how the word can feel or conjure up in you mouth as you say it willy and fanny are soft childlike words no hard consonants if you say the word minge feel your lips draw apart at the start the way your tongue moves to the top of your mouth for the n like shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit its a word well suited to drawing out or sneering imvho anyhows
my girlfriend has very recently learnt the word manterrupting from youtube and now uses it whenever i try to get a word in edgeways oh dear the end is nigh
your mind is all over the place loving your lack of any logic
my god you dont know but theres an epidemic of seagulling surely you cant actually never heard of anyone who actually experienced this appalling and almost impossible to organise act
oh please it is only in big cities and university towns where feminism has a stronghold use words like mansplaining in rural somerset or alabama and you will be laughed out of the pub
i would agree that there is a problem with the rise of gendered language words like mansplaining and manflu particularly are fundamentally sexist given the implication that arrogance and malingering are traits only exhibited by men
i can remember the girl next door asking to see my willy and shell show me her fanny when we were about  i often wish women still behaved like this as they get older
got yaapologies for misunderstanding in which case yes i agree 
mahdawi malenamed storms wouldnt be taken seriously they argued because they wouldnt evoke female rage hell hath no fury like a femalenamed storm and all that of course the opposite could be true if society doesnt take women seriously storm doreen isnt going to be scary enough to act as a warning compared to storm arnie on the other hand the ancient greek furies were all women and supernatural agents of vengeance oh and according to one song the wind is called maria rather than say nigel
so can we
british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina ms kosztovics just didnt do her research did she nor did ms madhawi my favourites mimsy which sounds rather sweet come on btlers lets show em the infinite variety of the english language amp its synonyms for fanny
somewhat along the same lines here is an interesting article examining the effect and ultimate end destination of this constant gender examination and in particular the demonisation of men men and womennever the twain shall ever meet is happening right now and is what many a feminist as you mention in your comments will tell you they want all of which interestingly ultimately proves the whole men are from mars women are from venus to be true that feminists will also attempt to generally rubbish it is my view that more than with anyone else feminists are in actuality arguing most vociferously with themselves httpquillettecomlaurakipnisrapeculturedisappearancesex
so if your girlfriend is saying your manterrupting and you want to stay in a relationship with her maybe listen to what shes saying absolutly right its allways best to humour the little lady
in welsh in north wales dyn is a man and dynes literally a female man is a woman that will take some sorting out
so if your girlfriend is saying your manterrupting and you want to stay in a relationship with her maybe listen to what shes saying i think i may have made the mistake of telling her i was a good listener once and she took that as a signal to never stop talking she even talks in her sleep
i once asked an american if i might bum a fag
too true thinking that the genderneutral existing terms of boss and ceo are exclusively male is hardcore sexism quite possibly unconscious sexism but sexism none the less
sorry about the double post thought it had been removed we need sex education because of a practice called seagulling a boarding school import what else that has spread to some university halls of residence it involves a group of guys standing outside a mates door while he has sex with a girl and then bursting in and ejaculating over her all at once never heard of it either outside the guardian
only in the guardian could this article appear in the opinion section willy for boys fanny for girls cant believe you never heard of that and as for hurricanes
true but it shows that the word man was not originally exclusive to males the original usage may not be in use now but to say that for example mankind is sexist shows an ignorance of how such a word came to mean anything at all
not sure if you are being facetious but manufacture amp manacle derive from latin for hand manus which ironically is feminine
thats one of the dangers of making assumptionslike sukis here they can often be wildly wrongsadly that does not stop such people from typing before they think
i always thought it was hysterical growing up that one of laurel and hardys girlfriends was called fanny she may as well have been called boobs to me when i was 
pedant or should that be mandant 
classic example of confirmation bias going on there with you youve formed a hypothesis in your mind and then just dont register all the incidents that disprove that theory instead concentrating on the  or  incidents that back up your theory
for example explaining that you go to an airport to catch a plane and a trainstation to catch a train theres a train you can catch at stansted airport
the resurrection of singular ungendered they addresses a real problem for anyone who cares about letting go of gender stereotypes all the other stuff mentioned strikes me as trendy inventions not even meriting the label slang which six months from now will be considered passéin dutch the equivalent to snippa is spleet pronounced splate but thats regarded as somewhat crude but in both dutch and english im sure ive heard parentkiddie words some quite charmingly innocent for the part in question
its called irrelevant to this definition which is about the case where the woman knows more no thats just the limitation you want to put on the discussion
notallfeminism but the points you make are among the reasons i no longer call myself a feminist
mahdawi there are  pictures tagged with girlboss on instagram it has become a cutesy girlpower phrase that is less empowering than it is patronising it doesnt tear down the sexism encoded in language it reinforces it along similar lines i was particularly amused by the fact that laura everyday sexism bates titled her latest book girl up bearing in mind all the issues surrounding asking boysmen to man up as mahdawi says words and phrases have gone from making an important point to simply being lazy ways to reinforce gender binaries never mind at least its an excuse to link to cameos word up complete with bright red codpiece action
mansplaining is when a man explains something that is really obvious that doesnt need explaining for example explaining that you go to an airport to catch a plane and a trainstation to catch a train
ooh you really dont like women do you or rather you dont like women having automony over their own lives why else would you hate feminism
only if your linguistic use is still stuck around ad
ego centric man believes everything he says must be true
mansplaining is when a man when talking to a woman assumes he knows more about a topic than the woman and explains it to her in a way he would never do to another man this happens unfortunately its also frequently apparently assumed with no available evidence other than his apparent gender and the fact he is explaining something to a female that the speaker would never do it to another man maybe we could in a similar vein call doing so womintepreting
wtf is seagulling
british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina kosztovics says this means little girls grow up with the thought that there is something wrong between their legs who says they do anna koszovics i dont know what she is using for the basis of this grand generalisation but i do know that she cant possibly be aware that millions of little girls believe that what is between their legs represents something wrong she needs to provide some evidence for this conclusion not refer to her own assumptions what girls feel about their gender and their genitals is down to the environment they grow up in initially this involves their parents and family members and expands as the child grows and experiences a wider sphere of influence what form this takes is influenced by religion and culture but this too expands as other cultures are encountered when i was growing up external female genitals were referred to as a fanny as others have said is the word so different from willy one is a girls name and one boys name fanny is no more pejorative than willy which in my opinion isnt at all it is not like the term front bottom because it isnt a bottom and there is no need to try to turn it into one just because it is located in the same region my children are teenagers now but when they were little both my sons and daughter used the term privates or private parts i dont recall saying this so they may have started using them in school or through friends i think this term is perfectly acceptable in most instances peoples genitals are private and they mostly want them kept that way the word doesnt convey that they should be ashamed of them or there is something wrong with them
disagree its malisms
woooooooooooooooosh extra big woosh for you
i always thought your fanny was your bottom male or female i believe that is the case in american in english fanny is a colloquial nonsexual word for female genitalia
damn i left my voightkampff machine at home ill just take your word for it that you are indeed a human
im not convinced you can class bosses and ceos together theyre typically two different personality types ceos tend to be male because the workplace at present frequently values personal qualities that are more likely to be male than female in that role similarly you get fewer introverts than extroverts in the role its not because women couldnt fulfil the requirements of the role its because to get to the role you have to be prepared to shout about how great you are and thats perhaps less common amongst women similarly itll be affected by the fact that recruitment panels tend to select people who are like them so it selfperpetuates and we end up with extrovert male ceos finally having a career break to look after children is often frowned upon and continuity of service is expected so there are a smaller pool of women who could potentially be ceos bosses which im interpreting as people managers i believe are now much more evenly balanced between the sexes because flexible working and a broadening of the idea of what personality types make a good boss have allowed a change to occur
yep fanny was to vagina as to willy was to penis when i was a kid too both words were thought of as slightly naughty as a kid but didnt have sexual connotations
not to mention the insane number of bags a handful of women seem to have on the trains and use up an extra seat with
hear hear pinkie kipnis is brilliant as was your post though an internal kangaroo caught sounds bloody painful pouch
a lot of good stuff not including this they are supposed to illuminate the fact that words such as boss and ceo are not actually genderneutral but implicitly coded as male many mums including my own are known as the boss and ive never known ceo to be implicitly known as a man they are gender neutral
my male friends do that to me all the time if i go to tell a story before i even get a chance they but in with their own story before i have a chance to tell mine its most infurating especially as theyre in total denial about it so if your girlfriend is saying your manterrupting and you want to stay in a relationship with her maybe listen to what shes saying
hinot having a goyes to the muff but isnt onomatopoeia about sounds that things makelike a queef not sure of spelling
trouble with fanny is that it means arse in the us i think youll find that it means ass in the us so confusions reigns if your donkeys called fanny
oh dear
sealioning was a new one thought you meant seagulling
sp prick
its called wind
perhaps it too late now but perhaps have a conversation with your sons about what they mean when they use words like femanazi as its a word usually used to demean feminism and consquently used by people who would prefer to see women subjugated
great article but the evidence of the modified language actually doing any good is still missing for instance languages including finnish hungarian and turkish has had genderneutral personal pronoun similar to they suggested in the article not for centuries but always hard to think that finland hungary and turkey are leading the gender equality based on this milleniaold advanced use of language i would actually think the only powerful thing is when a word is coined to name something that had no name before like the few examples given in the article
she sound controlling get the hell outta there brosephus
what is it called if a man when talking to a woman knows he knows more about a topic and explains it its called irrelevant to this definition which is about the case where the woman knows more that does happen sometimes
dont be a pick 
of you dont know what you did that was wrong dont expect me to explain it 
i grew up thinking that the colloquial term for a vagina was fanny which is what everyone called it apart from my aunt who called it a hot dogs not sure why but shes from coventry though so
my dad accused me of it the other week my gf was quietly livid guardian readers one and all
kindgenerousinteresting
never quite grasped das mädchen its slightly strange but its just because the diminutive ending chen is always neuter so anything else would sound strange to german ears similarly for das fräulein i can handle das mädchen but i find it very odd when they proceed to use the pronoun it several times to refer back to the mädchen which sounds very odd indeed
girlboss and sheeo are supposed to illuminate the fact that words such as boss and ceo are not actually genderneutral but implicitly coded as male that language is man made and reinforces a male world view but these words are actually genderneutral theyre not implicitly coded at all its perfectly normal to say shes my boss or shes the ceo think how many words have faded from the lexicon policewoman flight stewardessair hostess comedienne authoress manageress mayoress its usually madam mayor mayoress is now reserved for a lady consort of a mayor even actress is on the way out the screen actors guild annually gives out awards for best male actor and best female actor this has all happened quite naturally without any push from paranoid conspiracy theoriststheres a notable oddity though in the other direction female homosexuals have their own word but male homosexuals dont they only have the alan partridge coinage gayman
bollocks no pun intended
ok but then it sounds like youre complaining more about lazy use of the term than the concept itself id probably agree with you there but i wouldnt conflate the two lots of words and phrases are used lazily and too broadly random literally hell like the gestapo without in any way impairing the original concept
sure mansplain is a feminist term it was coined to refer to a specific issue with men patronising women but the meaning swiftly degraded and it became a lazy ad hominem used to dismiss any comment made by a man this has the unfortunate outcome of feminists using a sexist term even when rightly decrying sexism
i thought he created man in his image and woman from mans spare rib
i wonder how many
if you provide some content rather than the bare proofbyassertion that people using the term mansplaining mistakenly believe themselves to be opposing sexism i will be very happy to engage with it
got anything of substance to add or just contentfree snark
i have no idea what your comment means but yes tennis is another good way to spend time youd otherwise be wasting on creating a brand new mystery language to replace english so i gave you a recommend
seriously boss or ceo are not gendered language in fact much of this misappropriation of gender neutral language as sexist bias masks the real problems of gender inbalance in society fixing the gender bias inherent in glass ceiling issues renders the supposed language issue neutral as boss or ceo should denote male and female roles in equal measure lets promote fairness and gender balance for willys and fannys in equal measure rather than setting up further gender barriers through the inappropriate deconstruction of perfectly satisfactory words and idioms
well he said hi im randy and i said sorry not interested so he said why are you pissed and i said i havent touched a drop so he said i could care less so i said thats very considerate and he said i only axed and i said well put it down finally i asked if hed let me have a puff on his sizeable cheroot then he punched me in the face
i work in healthcare and use they to discuss a patient whilst maintaining confidentiality perfectly acceptable in my field
the worst spreading i ever encountered was the man in an opposite seat who stretched out his legs until we were toe to toe sounds like your energies might be better spend persuading bus and train operators to provide seating designed for people over 
then let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify my remarks youre welcome
mansplain and the like are generally used by people who are labouring under the misapprehension that they oppose sexism lucky for the women of the world youre hear to correct them then
willy meet fanny
so based on your prejudices you deliberately misinterrpreted what i was saying which actually was sometimes people do stuff without realising their doing it so if someone they care about raises an issue dont dismiss them outright but listen to what theyre saying now why do you find that so unreasonable hanice try my argument is precisely to ensure there is no prejudice you just assumed the fella was in the wrong and that he should listen to his girlfriendbecause he is wrong and she is right there was no mention of the term sometimes in fact you said all the time in your original post
russian french chinesenone of these have a genderneutral personal pronoun either its not quite as simple as that see eg httpsdailyjstororgtheyreheretheyregenderqueergetusedtogenderneutralpronouns
and mrs slocombe
it depends whether she knows more about prostate cancer than you i wonder if defendyourself is aware of that dependence where did you do your oncological training what oncological training are you referring to
no you didnt then let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify my remarks
i said that if their experience has been one free from gender discrimination thats good news no you didnt did you miss out some verbs no
it is only men that say pussy
i am not entirely sure she is taking modern feminism very seriously hahasounds like it she should get a job writing for the grad
lol thanks for the link 
ahhhh fair enough
how do you know its great news for them the difference from your limited experience could be bad news for them i said that if their experience has been one free from gender discrimination thats good news youre welcome to disagree if you would prefer there to be gender discrimination entirely up to you see also women nagging i dont know what that means did you miss out some verbs
a woman did it in an australian forum parliament possibly she sounded completely ridiculous and was rightly called out on it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzoxhrepowi
nice article arwa any chance you could reuse the source material for an internal office memo i think the moderators and many of your fellow journalists should read it
if your experience differs then thats great news for you how do you know its great news for them the difference from your limited experience could be bad news for them but for those who feel otherwise it doesnt seem unreasonable to make the point see also women nagging
so my doctor was womsplaining when she talked to me about prostate cancer ill tell her to check her privilege at my next appointment it depends whether she knows more about prostate cancer than you where did you do your oncological training
surely the correct term in guardianland would be non gender specific and applicable to genitalia of any form be the genitalia male female or hermaphrodite this would be a great help for those parents electing to rear their children as gender neutral as having to identify whether they have a willy or a fanny must be quite traumatic
the writer is from new york where fanny means bum so i guess american children dont have an equivalent word but then i didnt think they used the word willy either so im not sure im pretty happy to be writing a legit comment while also using the words fanny and willy and bum though
theres simply no reason other than a sexist approach to make either of those gendered since its not like women are incapable of doing exactly the same thing women arent incapable of doing the same thing of course not but women tell me their experience is and despite being a man i notice this happening as well that men are far more often the culprits similarly racial discrimination in employment can take place against white people but generally statistically and historically its more likely to take place against black people if your experience differs then thats great news for you but for those who feel otherwise it doesnt seem unreasonable to make the point
exactly with added monumental lack of selfawareness or hypocrisy
i dont think pwllgw wasnt making an assertion they believe is true
i thought it was reasonable to assume that they didnt know about the thing i was saying they hadnt read the thing i was talking about but apparently i was basically an mras wet dream sadly its the direction modern feminism seems to have taken and why many women distance themselves from the label
i think mansplaining is usually used to refer to one of  a man explaining to a woman as if imparting a fact something that is actually a matter of opinion and so not a factual issue at all eg an opinion on brexit  a man explaining to a woman a fact or facts that the woman is betterplaced to know eg a male student repeatedly correcting their female lecturer theres simply no reason other than a sexist approach to make either of those gendered since its not like women are incapable of doing exactly the same thing certainly there is a shedload of people explaining to those they assume are men as if imparting a fact something that is actually a matter of opinion right here in this thread some must be women
putting your bag on an empty seat is fine as long as the bus or train is less than half empty once it begins to fill up i pick it up at the stations and put it down if the seat is not taken the worst spreading i ever encountered was the man in an opposite seat who stretched out his legs until we were toe to toe while i had my feet tucked back to give him space to reach his seat i was too flabbergasted to comment as he sat there oblivious
so based on your prejudices you deliberately misinterrpreted what i was saying as my daughter would write omfg the interpretation based on prejudices is likely yours since the original was my girlfriend has very recently learnt the word manterrupting from youtube and now uses it whenever i try to get a word in edgeways it being finished with whenever i try to get a word in edgeways indicates it was being sarcastic your prejudices apparently interpreted that comment as necessarily a male interrupting their girlfriend in exactly the way thats being complained about rather than the girlfriend in question being the one doing the dismiss them outright rather than listen to what theyre saying
earlier this year kosztovics called for the uk to follow swedens lead in a video on the bbc british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina kosztovics says this means little girls grow up with the thought that there is something wrong between their legs she adds there are  million people who speak english and i think its time for you to discover your own word i say let the best word win fanny seeked the equivalent to willy when i was growing up and seemed to work fine for my kids too
no its when a man has the absolute fucking cheek to explain something that only affects women to a woman a man explaining menstruation pregnancy childbirth and breast feeding to a woman is mansplaining so my doctor was womsplaining when she talked to me about prostate cancer ill tell her to check her privilege at my next appointment
enid blyton had children called fanny and dick in the magic faraway tree a recent radio version had franny and rick
it is bad because it sounds like youre referring to an object not a person they is not an americanism and does the job well
i always thought it was down to having unfeasably large testacles
he made a sweeping unsubstaniated negative comment about people who want women to have equality with men part of that being having autonomy of their own lives why would anyone do that
whats the problem with this lack of a genderneutral personal pronoun we have it seems adequate for those who cant decide if they are a boy or a girl russian french chinesenone of these have a genderneutral personal pronoun either the fact that a yank styleguide might use they as a singular personal pronoun is symptomatic of a people who elected donald trump we dont need it here
very true post apart from the rape in my opinion we already know to protect ourselves or are taught to but the whole point always is that it is a man who is raping and rapist will always find a victim because there always be a woman out there who is more vulnerable at this particular moment sick or distracted or perhaps distressed and she then might become a victim telling women to protect themselves is a very short step to telling them that it is their fault for being raped if they fail to protect themselves for whatever reason
no thanks i soon learned that i voted for a front bottom in the last general election and ive no wish to repeat the experience
all of what you say is true its just one of those terms thats very easy to abuse
ps gender is a grammatical term while sex is the word for the sexes the americans however find themselves unable to say the word sex without giggling so have opted for the inaccurate but to them more palatable gender and we are apparently following suit writing this in the guardian which uses american punctuation gives me a certain frisson i suppose they cant afford the upgrade
no its when a man has the absolute fucking cheek to explain something that only affects women to a woman a man explaining menstruation pregnancy childbirth and breast feeding to a woman is mansplaining a man explaining the intricacies of car engines to a woman is simply a bore isnt that just im the parent so i know whats best logic being a parent doesnt make you an expert on child rearing and being a woman doesnt make you an expert on biology a man trying to tell a woman about follicle stimulating hormone may actually know more than her about it even though his body doesnt produce it
difference being that mansplain and the like are generally used by people who are labouring under the misapprehension that they oppose sexism
so the point i was making and the point your making  separate things with little relevance to each other
thats a valid distinction
so based on your prejudices you deliberately misinterrpreted what i was saying which actually was sometimes people do stuff without realising their doing it so if someone they care about raises an issue dont dismiss them outright but listen to what theyre saying now why do you find that so unreasonable
didnt germaine greer herself say that it was now about superiority
none of the above was supposed to be an excuse it was supposed to be a list of possible explanations im not sure why you find it so offensive at no point did i say that men were in the wrong i just think that the way things are now discriminates against particular personality types when it need not do and that in many cases a bit more introversion and less selfconfidence amp risktaking would be no bad thing that was why i brought in introverts vs extroverts i think that quietintroverted men are discriminated against similarly please could you let me know which bits you disagree with
articles that use the terms mansplaining or manspreading usually make me stop reading this is one welcome exception
do you want to start a competition comparing those words which reflect badly on men and those which reflect badly on women i wonder which list would be longer given that we know that society used to be far more sexist against females and that the list of previously acceptable ones would be longer for women it would be more instructive to do so with a starting point of general societal understanding that such words are sexist and wrong so going with ones that have emerged recently are there any recent equivalents to mansplain manflu manspreading which extrapolate as if the trait is somehow inherent to the gender
im pretty sure that snippa is the swedish word for the vulva not the vagina which cant be seen without a speculum so probably doesnt worry most girls i think vulva would be fine unless it sounds too much like vulgar in which case i would suggest dawn frenchs inoffensive construction front bottom another referendum perhaps
i dunno that sounds about right
well if you like they are rather clinical words which arent particularly attractive and part of the article was concerned with why there isnt a female equivalent to willy but as weve seen there is it might be easier in that children would only be familiarising themselves with two words instead of a load of varied and regional terms but why is it better
the article seems to have added a couple on the male side
or rather you dont like women having automony over their own lives why else would you hate feminism have you ever heard of the term motte and bailey principle its where someone makes an extreme argument until challenged at which point they claim their argument was always a milder one before returning to their original point when the challenge has passed eg f the patriarchy teaches men that they own womens bodies and thats why they manspread with their manlegs to show hatred of the feminine space m wow thats crazy f but feminism just means that women are people too you agree with that dont you m yes i agree with that f so you agree patriarchic manspreading slutshames all women
but mansplaining and the various other manwords have become overused and diluted  yes here by this paper
since youre the one asserting someone needs to shush if it isnt true it really ought to be incumbent on you to provide the answers to your question its incumbent on someone asking a question to provide answers to it thats an odd view
it is confusing as so often sex and gender are conflated and terms used as if they were interchangeable which they are not i remember reading a title that appeared on my university reading list in the s called sex roles and the school that then went on to explain in the introduction that it was actually gender roles that the book was about and not sex roles thus perhaps adding to the confusion though anyone reading the book itself would have come away understanding the difference and never again conflating the two however some  years on i still get people looking at me strangely when i correct them as clearly most people are still as perplexed as they ever were there exists a similar confusion surrounding race and ethnicity too in both cases though official documents and forms add to the confusion when asking about questions about gender when they mean sex and ethnicity when they mean race or skin colour
did the conversation continue and if so how
i would imagine youd find that with respect to mankind very few people indeed would reply that it refers to men and not women so the percentage for b would be very small also a would be those who think it refers to men and women not knows about the etymological origins of man since youre the one asserting someone needs to shush if it isnt true it really ought to be incumbent on you to provide the answers to your question
but how often can you tell that they wouldnt do the same to a man and why would you need a gendered term unless you suppose women never do a similar thing not very often so you should avoid ever using the term what is it called if a man when talking to a woman knows he knows more about a topic and explains it its just explaining something i think that although mansplaining is a thing it is a term that has become hugely debased by overuse and misuse see my above reply
surely its better and easier to call them penis and vulva
thats just plain old sulking
i didnt think it was but they seemed to think it was i also realised that i couldnt remember hearing anyone not from scotland saying it
unfortunately its also frequently apparently assumed with no available evidence other than his apparent gender and the fact he is explaining something to a female that the speaker would never do it to another man i totally agree how one can tell that you wouldnt have done that to a man is beyond me obviously sometimes one can point to another example where the person hasnt done that but thats another matter ive also been accused of mansplaining something in an instance i thought was pretty reasonable for me to assume that i knew more about subject than the woman i was explaining to i was at an academic conferencetype thing and was asked well it was a sort of dont you agree with metype question a question relating to my phd topic by an undergraduate who worked in an entirely different area i thought it was reasonable to assume that they didnt know about the thing i was saying they hadnt read the thing i was talking about but apparently i was basically an mras wet dream
no its when a man has the absolute fucking cheek to explain something that only affects women to a woman a man explaining menstruation pregnancy childbirth and breast feeding to a woman is mansplaining a man explaining the intricacies of car engines to a woman is simply a bore
according to genesis in the beginning god created people in gods image so i guess thats male and femalethats the christian god anyway
sex is biological and gender is ones preference
sounds a bit like fake news
spot on
what about the patriarchy im ok with patriarchy but the patriarchy just sounds like the illuminati to me and its use is fairly widespread even in this publication
some do which is fine when youre not married 
so gender is a social construct or a biological fact im so confused these days
youve formed a hypothesis in your mind and then just dont register all the incidents that disprove that theory instead concentrating on the  or  incidents that back up your theory people have been saying this to those that use manspreadingmansplaining for years now
agree  remaining  is an mini quibble over feminism wanting superiority i do agree that theres a noisy minority that make it seem as if it is no doubt turning off women and girls who could otherwise get behind the projecti agree thought that the proliferation of words like this serve only to ppison the well and turn people off when has insulting someone with these childish insults like these ever convonved them of the merits of an argument
yet hostess has become host and actress is now actor while boss needs to do the reserve and become girlboss i dont see the logic of the argument and im a man oh wait p
well what attitude do you expect feminists to come out with
yes does not go into any further detail thought not
but the whole point of the definition of mansplaining is that the man doesnt know as much as the woman that might be the definition but that is not how it is used and even with the definition we are required to assume that the woman actually knows more and the man would not do the same thing with another man ive had someone insist that they know what they were doing when i was explaining it to them and they were annoyed that i was doing so the kicker though was the fact that the only reason i was explaining it to them was they had caused a serious accidentincident had to be reported to the hse by doing the wrong thing some men not all men assume that they know more than any woman does about some subjects but dont assume that they know more than any man does and so talk to men and women differently about those subjects sure but the same is true for women particularly feminists in the area of gender equality but any attempt to label them in such a pejorative manner would be met with misogyny and sexist
right off the top revisionist history right off the top massive hypocrisy you werent there at every meeting of all feminists so cant reasonably say its just not true you have demonstrated exactly the problematic attitude though what we were saying is that there should be equality of opportunity for everyone regardless of gender race sexual orientation religion etc equality of opportunity is not the same as fortunately its great you were saying that but many more and many more in the mainstream were saying equality of outcome is what was required hence the constant pointing to outcomes and not opportunity its why the earning gap is still referred to as the pay gap why stupid people say or believe that you can state that women work for free from ltinsert stupidly calculated date heregt or at the current rate women will achieve equality in pay in ltinsert a different stupidly calculated date heregt
but do british parents actually teach their kids thats its ok to call it a fanny from my wifes experience working in pre school that word and and a variety of others are not problematic
hisneering sounding word yes definitely now i think of it but its a very soft sounding word toolike blancmangeits got the best of both worlds
and were back to feminist claptrap every excuse under the sun rather than simply admitting that every characteristic which can make the difference between a life in an institution life working for an institution or a life being the boss of one is subject to the statistical difference between men and women
well said lola being politically correct is good the policy referred to is a policy of respect for humanist values as id define it nobody could really argue against that so the right instead manages to rubbish the concept of respect for humanist values by tangentially painting it as interfering moralistic and even somehow prudeish to be politically correct is to be right
hes bemoaning that if he did drunkenly run down canal street shouting fags that he might be subject to criticism for it
but thats a damn argument in all likelihood its the knee jerk defence of the racist oh everybody else does it too how does he fucking know that to be the case
another hollywood star with a pet project they all seem to have one pet cause or another this one seems genuinely concern about what has become of his world when a man cant even be allowed free reign to unleash the full repertoire of ones crude earthy obscene obnoxious smutty verbal volley on those thinskinned folks this is one hollywood alister so woefully lacking in emotional intelligence and selfawareness he failed to anticipate just how his illthoughtout sentiment may be interpreted
ive travelled a lot there are plenty of rude disparaging names for whitey you just dont know them
i dont think it is cognitive dissonance as our language and behaviour has become externally policed so has what used be considered good manners declined
i agree its every single persons god who is a white man given right and it is a right to be offensive it doesnt matter who we offend it doesnt matter who we harass as long as i can be a short sighted offensive prick for reasons arent that im an awful abhorrent person we have a god given right to upset marginalized groups these are truly the hallmarks of a free and just society
i beg your pardon i see that i did not make myself clear i did not mean to imply that you did but that the author of this article does
thats not what he did though he trotted out the same tired stereotype about jewish control of hollywood
if youll keep coming on your colleagues menwomen youll find it they dont like you as well good lord unless you work in porn if you keep coming on your colleagues i hope you get sacked at the very least
he really should have made these remarks with a can of cola in one hand a hamburger in his jaw a cigarette behind his ear and a bar of chocolate in the other hand the he could have offended absolutely everyone
the real pity is that its only the rich and powerful jewish and gay rights lobby especially those in film and the media that can this quickly get an unequivocal and grovelling apology from a star using the antipc arguments everyday people get away with racist and islamphobic comments saying its political correctness gone mad to deny the truth on the bigotted comments and no one bats an eye lid all prejudice and bigotry is equal but some forms is more equal than others
seeing as the author of this piece is basically lying about what oldman said i hope the graun has a good legal team
what happened to actors with manners you didnt have to put up with this kind of shit from david niven
bonus fact his sister is big mo in eastenders however as far as i know little mo is not played by the sister of gary numan
its a shame any opinions of mel gibson get beyond those within a few feet of him when he airs them to make it worse by letting another fu actor for f sake afaffs warm it up and then have scribblers put sprinkles on it is unforgivable get a grip and stop reporting celebrity comment it doesnt do anybody any good they are mostly idiots with already ridiculously inflated opinions of their worth to mankind stop it now
my view is that there is a world of difference between someone saying crass things that make them appear to be a bit of an arse before right thinking individuals whoever they are and actively inciting hatred and violence its the difference between you thinking to yourself what an arse before walking away and seeing a raceriot or a lynching offence is one of the few things in life that is free to take at no cost to anyone apart from yourself just call the offensive person an arsehole and let it go definitely do not force an insincere apology
we have a vast lexicon to disparage minorities not too much choice for white males who run the show
but now our language is policed for us have we given up on good manners
perhaps although i think some people can be ingenuious in what they will seize upon in order to dismiss something because they dont like the basic argument for me the issue is is she misrepresenting what he said and i dont think she is
more than anything it shows how breathtakingly dim and removed from real life hollywood actors are the question is why ever do actors think their thoughts are incredibly insightful when their career consists of saying someone elses words
oh and look up racism you dont appear to know what it means you cant just make stuff up to suit your argument
i agree people have the right to be offensive that does not mean that people should be gratuitously insulting the problem comes when people claim to be offended not by gratuitous insults but because someone says or writes something they disagree with the classic case is the satanic verses a moslem may find them offensive but that is tough luck just like it is tough luck if a christian find the life of brian offensive
oh dear you seem to bear out the article
nope you dont have to believe black people are inferior forngger to be offensive its a racial slur i would question why somebody who is not racist is so insistent on referring to a black person in that manner particularly when you know said person finds it offensive
these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman its considered bad form to name women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts and when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots no lola this is your highlysubjective and doneforareason deliberately erroneous interpretation of words oldman said in an interview to another publication with no explanation given either in the original interview or your piece of the context his body language etc etc the best way of establishing if oldman is really a dyedinthewool bigot is to arrange an interview with him yourself that might be hard work i can see but at least it might be more interesting reading than this piece
just the other day my granddad who had threatened to vote ukip was saying i have no time for political correctness which is weird when i think about it in retrospect as he was an irish immigrant in london in the s i could never understand so many people defending jeremy clarkson a few months ago how is a highly privileged white wealthy straight cis man using a slur that was been used to oppress black people for centuries supposedly not racist and even more confusingly why were so many people saying yes its not a good thing to do but hes not a racist when it comes down to it political correctness really is a basic level of respect for minority groups and oppressed sections of society people claim they cant keep up with all the terminology nowadays particularly in lgbtq spheres and yet we have the internet this amazing tool for research while the opportunity is there educate yourself make that extra effort and the more you treat others particularly the oppressed minorities with respect the more respect youll earn in return
rightwingers spit
i agree im of the mind that what he said was  wrong he had a point he was trying to make but screwed it up in spectacular fashion and he needs to understand what he said was wrong but because of pieces like this which mise and fabricate intent what he actually said has been drowned out and hes ended up saying sorry for something totally different that he didnt even say and what hell most likely take away from this is they didnt understand me so i had to say sorry not what i actually sad was wrong
i only say it undermines it because it makes people dismiss her points as soon as they realise shes sensationalised it i just think its a shame because its unnecessary if what he said is so bad and i think it is then theres no need to make it sound worse it just seems that you lack confidence in the strength of your argument
i think that gary was complaining more than anything that people like mel gibson and himself are held to a higher level of scrutiny than all others because theyre famous he seemed to take issue with the fact that mel gibson was named and shamed publicly for drunkenly saying something that people hear on a daily basis at work in the pub in private conversations im sure the police officers who arrested gibson hear that kind of language every day but because hes so famous it was suddenly a much bigger thing just because they say these things doesnt necessarily mean that they genuinely think them but theres no wiggle room for people in the public eye now mel gibson will forever be known for one drunken mistake im not saying that it excuses behaviour like that but im also not jumping on the gary oldman hates minorities bandwagon either because however crass it was there was some truth in what he was saying
show me someone who isnt a hypocrite and ill show you a liar we all have prejudices the polite ones amongst us self censor
it is a cliché to say no one is perfect but it is true we may lose our temper we may not understand things as well as others we may have a cynical or naïve outlook which alters how we respond to others we may forget that others have feelings especially when there are so many of us disregarding the fact but i think people are ugliest when they either feel superior or threatened it doesnt matter how right or wrong they are in that feeling it just brings out the worst in us and is something we need to learn to recognise but yet our ability to do that may well be one of our weaknesses in itself so that is the kind of dilemma we face as a species
thus deafness blindness spasticity and crippling conditions have been removed from our society not by curing these conditions but eliminating the words that describe them garbage which words for deafness have been made taboo words inherited from more brutal times within living memory were used brutally language was used to demean people with afflictions which were not medically understood or culturally tolerated language worked fine then to assert social values as it always has thankfully our culture and science have advanced to produce a culture which is not so brutal and which requires less emotive and prejudiced language because the disabled and other persecuted groups are now more politically aware and selfconfident they demanded the end to insulting language not your crackpot trot plot if you dont accept peoples right to be treated with dignity naff off back to the past
despite constant vigilance from the pc brigade you make them sound like the stasi
these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman context mate contexttheres nothing wrong with a good old fashioned expletive and stereotype insult to race gender or sexual orientation ive more money than you is just as much a put down when you are poor and cant tell em to naff off the issue occurs when there is an element of power and control included with the statement calling names to the waitress or the hair dresser when they cannot insult you back is the issue pc is not necessary amongst equals and should be no issue insults made when drunk is normally because alcohol brings out your true character
go read some books yknow the ones that arent just stories it might help you think about things in a bit more depth or would that be a bit too intellectual for you i see that the wish to root civility and fairness in society to which the article refers has yet to be granted to some
lola has done a shocking job on misrepresenting what he actually said first valenti now this what is up with guardian opinion writers
whats offensive lets see now calling people nigger or fucking jew or fucking useless cunt well you cant get much more offensive than that really whatever people think is their own business but when they pollute the atmosphere with their offensive thoughts it becomes everyone elses business and those on the receiving end of those insults have every right to be offended
does her no favours though im generally in support of everything she says but you have to admit that presenting them this way deliberately sensationalises it i dont have to admit it i dont think its a misrepresentation of his comments although ill concede its sensationalised i dont think it undermines anything she says about them though
this is an issue not only in the ukim writing from italy where a whole new nomenclature of terms has sprung upon us to replace old non pc termsas perhaps only a partial answer to lola a man rang up the morning radio programme to which i listen infuriated by the fact that the old classic word blindis now called video leso visually chellenged as a blind man he was objecting to the new term which he called ridiculous and kept saying he was fucking blindso perhaps its not just a simple open and shut thing adfter all or the guardian always wanting to graft in a political stance to everything
political correctness as humorless language policing thank you for the best definition ive seen it should go in the oed
i agree with the substance of lola okolosies points i am just surprised that she seems happy argue for them in the name of political correctness it is a stupid and objectionable phrase i want to show proper respect for others which includes the right to make reasonable criticism whatever their gender culture racial or ethnic make up and i want my language to reflect that on the other hand i have no desire to be politically correct
id like to suggest a poster on the wall of the cif department thou shalt not commit logical fallacies
you cant get more left wing than lovie gary old man dear
no defense of oldman but this article is as shameless as a tabloid in its misuse of es
what makes you think oldman seriously apologized his apology re antisemitism was so right on that it was clearly insincere his apology was the equivalent of someone saying nigger and then apologizing by saying mesepotamia is truely the cradle of modern civilization and thus blackbrown people truely are the superior race
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone why you have an opinion its not popular so what if you feel strongly enough about something to take a stand publicly dont turn around and apologize the next day its pathetically weak act cowardly and most of all dishonest before you open your dumb mouth next time check to see if you own a pair of balls first
i read up to the bit where you make a sentence out of the word periodtheres no need for that kind of language
do you mean that someone also has the right to be offensive to you
which is his point hypocrisy
vigilance will be stepped up be sure only ever to use approved newspeak or else its the guardian cellars for you
i didnt bye
if you are correct in what you say about oldman which being a cif piece i doubt then it is absurd for him to complain that political correctness means he cannot use racist homophobic and generally downright offensive language no civilised person would wish to use such language it is equally absurd to claim that political correctness has just been about condemning such language it has been a pernicious attempt to control speech in order to control debate
well he also suggested that what mel gibson and alec baldwin said was what we all say most people complaining about the politically correct brigade seems to have neglected that little tidbit
take a word in common usage add ist or ism to the end of it then get it into your article happens a lot on here
comedy is about commodifying anxietylaughter occurs when unwarranted anxiety is realized were socialized to be immeasurable anxious regardinggenderrace etc comedy teases that sensitivity amp anxiousness society has bred into us it only makes us laugh because we were never comfortable w it to begin remember if you want to place restrictions on speech out of sensitivity there is no limit to how sensitive we can convince ourselves of anything thus there is no limit to how much speech can be policed out of sensitivity
for me political correctness is little more than basic politeness and basic politeness demands that you dont misinterpret someones statements for your own purposes
this is a disgraceful piece of journalism i dont have to agree with what oldman said to recognise that this is nonetheless a parody of his actual interview
humourlessness i say it all the time give us a bloody edit function
political correctness is basically just cultural marxism the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms whenever i read something like this my first thought is that the speaker is pissed off they cant use racial slurs anymore without attracting widespread disgust
jewish people do run hollywood period studios practically shut down during jewish holidays its a fact despite all the real horrors of war and mankind over centuries to this day not much time goes by without yet another bad guy nazi film being released why do you think that is its a conspiracy
no he wasnt if you read the original es and not the mashed up version atl if was that he was pointing out the hypocrisy of getting piously offended by what someone else says when in all likelihood youve said just as offensive things yourself
i find stephen fry somewhat overexposed but here i agree with him its now very common to hear people say im rather offended by that as if that gives them certain rights its actually nothing more than a whine i find that offensive it has no meaning it has no purpose it has no reason to be respected as a phrase i am offended by that well so fucking what
actually the fag connotation was rather well explained by south parkit has a number of meanings and unless you know for sure the person is gay it doesnt have to always be viewed as a homophobic slur but that directly contradicts what south park said about the n word when stan kept telling token that he shouldnt be offended by his dad saying it because he didnt mean it that way the conclusion being that stan realises he doesnt know what its like for token and doesnt get to say how token should feel about it the lesson dont take your politics from south park
yepdecent actor but not much upstairstheyre only actors though not really required to be intellectuals
this is like the apology debate i once worked with a social worker whos opinions in private were to the right of hitler in the workplace however he never put a foot wrong so what do you want honesty and educate or box ticking with your head in the sand in this hystericalised climate im looking at sydney
i agree for once someone is saying what they think instead of just spouting out something dull and meaningless which is probably bollocks because they are scared of saying anything unpc it makes them all seem so robotic when they all behave in the same way at least he has an actual opinion whether its good or not is another thing
apparently he ed what other people said which is bad true but not as bad you are making it out to be theres a simple solution when someone says something unforgivably offensive and insulting say something back that is much much worse about them without swearing thats important no swearing or you automatically lose the moral high ground you may have to duck and be ready to scarper but its the shocked and indignant reaction theyre after so just hit the ball right back at them hard
i do think theres a difference between calling out racist and sexist language and a kind of oversensitive humourless that in the main comes from middle class liberals the sort of stuff that some would brand pc i remember once mocking the spelling of a racist edl activist who couldnt even spell muslim properly and was promptly chastised for looking down my nose at an obviously ignorant working class man the irony that im working class myself and was being told this by some joyless uppermiddle class liberal isnt lost on me i do think that what nobsacks like gary oldman brand pc is just basic human decency but the above anecdote does show that there are some stuffy oversensitive types out there
tuttut a reproachable accentist attitude
i know what you mean people should be angry about what he actually said rather than trying to make it something its not
thats entirely reasonable and therefore unacceptable
you can change what people feel they can say in public but you cant always change what they think no one and that includes the left has the right to police anothers words no one has the right to make another conform and to only use the words they think they should we still live in a free society and people must have the right to be offensive does this obvious fact have to be spelled out obviously it does anyway what is offensive
oldman has since apologised not exactly kinda
definition of ableism the creed that decries the practice of entrusting jobs to the people best able to do them it has come a very long way in britain recently
political correctness is a febrile reactionary myth a nightmare monster to unite against the hysteria of a mass of prejudices and bigotries under threat from better standards of living and education an absurdity everyone thinks their politics is correctwhat they might mean by political correctness apart from not being able to inflict their hate as they used to is better described as dogmatism of which they are the masters as for the perversion of the language see any advertising hoarding or daily mail columnist or the monstrous wooden dialect spoken and written by corporate america
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality yes that is precisely what is so wrong with pc language it was and remains an attempt to change society not by force of reason or appeals to our better nature but by simply robbing the english language of the power to speak the truth thus deafness blindness spasticity and crippling conditions have been removed from our society not by curing these conditions but eliminating the words that describe them differences between the sexes have been eliminated not by changing our biology thank god but by disallowing gendered words it was always an absurd project which is why pc has been so mercilessly mocked reality doesnt change because we lose the words to describe it all that happens is that we lose some of our ability to deal with reality only a fool would believe that you can eliminate racism by banning the word nigger or homophobia by banning faggot pc language is the passion of those who prefer illusion to reality conformity to diversity and authoritarian dictate to reasoned argument
does her no favours though im generally in support of everything she says but you have to admit that presenting them this way deliberately sensationalises it i read the full e yesterday and even i had to go back and check because i was shocked that id misremembered it so badly
there are several sides to whats interpreted as political correctness some good and some bad in my opinion the side that is about formalising and structuring the rules of politeness in public life are i think fine noone in a professional capacity and ideally at any other time should make another person feel worthless because of their ethnicity ability gender or any other factor its only right that it be made clear that discriminatory practices and language are unacceptable and that we are trying to build a culture where people are offered respect and dignity the rather more sinister side is that championed by many on the liberalleft spectrum a place where i normally position myself except on matters of censorship the parts that involve the legal system or government in the policing of language or thought and the criminalisation of offense particularly the attitude of truth is no defence against offensiveness its better to stay silent than to risk offense or using bad words about this group is worse than using bad words against that group or you may not question topic x because to do so is offensive to group z
its really uncool to say all that especially in an interview behind closed doors with your mates fine yes im beginning to see oldmans point about hypocrisy now
curb speech and you curb freedoms for some but you can allow for greater equality hence why hate speech and defamation laws exist no free society has to tolerate the intolerant
you are obviously not able to understand it shame on you whoops sorry that was ablest of me
everybody deserves to be treated with respect
its hard to find the interview in full because only taken out of context does it serve its purpose as gossip im still looking for whats antiquated about his views gary was observing the world he is experiencing jewish people do run hollywood period studios practically shut down during jewish holidays its a fact despite all the real horrors of war and mankind over centuries to this day not much time goes by without yet another bad guy nazi film being released why do you think that is gary oldman was observing the industry in which he works and the world as he sees it its called his perspective which he has a right to the funny thing is hipster trash that grew up on politically correct nonsense will someday get old as well and find younger people telling them their speech and views are antiquated more people need to see this pc nonsense as it really is antiintellectualism how about discussing his views with another real person instead of ranting on the internet what about reading the entire interview seeing how other people think differently than you nah just be offended i do not agree with what you have to say but ill defend to the death your right to say it voltaire
sorry mrs tiz that sever reprimand was meant for darnac i got it clicking wrong
everyone
as usual to further their own agenda for national blandness the guardian takes one or two examples and extrapolates massively from them for their own uses they have turned out to be on the wrong side of public sentiment about the fabricant comment and theyre trying to wriggle out of it as usual the guardians view of things is particularly narrow if you take a wider look at the issue the opposite to what they claim actually turns out to be the case and the siren cries for inoffensive speech and writing is being used to suppress dissenting opinion this is never truer than within the papers own website comments sections where almost any post that offers an alternative interpretation or opposing view is rapidly erased this censorship flies directly in the face of the outrage expressed in all areas of the media about levesons proposals and shows them to be hypocrites of the first order to e stephen fry about offense being taken so fucking what
political correctness it would appear is about either pushing your own agenda or attempting to derail someone elses just take the guardian for example the patron saint of the pc brigade brigade more like platoon in size company at most and its attitudes towards immigration every single cif piece on it will be filled with people btl attempting to shut the debate down by shouting racism
when did ableist become a commonly understood term was i asleep 
you are being ablestuserphobic stop it at once
if you think gay men marrying women and then realizing they are gay and leaving their wife is a wrong thing you can only criticize gay men qua gay men as if they werent gay they would not do that particular thing if society had allowed gay men to marry who they wished and be happy then they would not do that particular thing if you are criticizing zionism logically you must be criticizing jews as jews because it is exclusively a jewish thing but it is not racist to do so all zionists are jews but not all jews are zionists same as al qaeda are muslims but not all muslims are al qaeda you can criticise the fringe elements of a world religion without generalising about millions of people if you cant then youre only showing your ignorance if you call someone a faggot as an insult you are literally equating being gay ie faggot with something bad the insult part therefore you are saying gaybad when i was young i used to say oh thats gay literally as a synonym for bad now i know there were some gay kids in our school they must have had the idea of gay bad forced onto them and it must have made it hard for them to accept themselves yet alone everyone else
you are being ablestuserphobic stop it at once
he didnt need to apologise i dont think he actually defended racist jokes he said it was in human nature to sometimes say bad and stupid things especially in anger that is someone who has never used a racist word in their life may well get drunk one day and get into an altercation in that altercation they may not use pc language he says we have all probably done something like that at some point i have seen enough good people occasionally do daft things to believe that i actually thought it was a well known human trait obviously what mel did to his wife was not a part of this
this article is wrong on so many levels it difficult to know where to start but the simple fact that oldman has been ed out of context is enough to justify its removal from the site sloppy journalism that sullies the reputation of the entire paper remove it now
if you grew up in the time before pc you grew up in a time when racial epithets were commonplace it might not have been considered bad manners to use them at the time but thats not the point
ah you see but thats the point ultimately the issue was not what the word means how its spelt or the context in which it was used the student complainants position was that the word made her feel bad and nobody had the right to dictate to her whether those feelings were valid or not the implications of such a position for freedom of speech are terrifying yet now so commonplace we almost dont question them anymore if you can decide that what i say offends you and the validity of the offence youve taken cant be questioned then you can effectively silence me on the flimsiest of pretexts
wow youd think someone at a university would be able to get a dictionary out
wisconsinmadison
how about alright wankers
which us college was that
never mind somewhere in the distant future an ageing waiter is greeting his young customers with hi guys and is being met with smirks and embarrassed laughter
i accept the point about current meaning but at the same time if you used the term in texas or various other southern us states it would be assumed you were referring to a group of men
i might address a group guys but not an individual guy so its not particularly relevant because the two are used in very different ways the plural is a collective noun form of address the singular is a description as for the british part thats my point well each make different assumptions
offence is rather more difficult to give than it is too takebut you being the apparently well balanced individual with chips on both shoulders
parliamentarians male andor female are mass debaters 
but not everybody seems to like that either
im not making a huge deal of it i wouldnt have necessarily assumed the guy to be british and since guy is the singular of guys it is surely very relevant
just why would you consider the identifying of gender as demeaningin my view actress and others identify gender without qualificationactresses do a much better job of portraying women than male actors shakespearean theatre and mrs doubtfire notwithstandingwaitresses are usually better as restaurant service personnel than the majority of mennot many women are as good as many men at swinging a  kg sledgehammerwe each have our own qualitiesnot one of us is equal to another not even apples with apples and oranges with orangesequal opportunities for equal qualities and skills is just but catagorically claiming the we should all be equal or even treated as equals is nonsense
did i need to add a sarcasm emoji after that comment
so it doesnt get used within your cohortthere a many others you knowor is it that only your experiences are valid
indeedkids is a name for young goats
that is patently not truenot any more than the false assumption that the different regions of the uk all speak the same englishthere is an universal standard to the language but there are very many natives of the english speaking nations who have a very poor grasp on it
which is illogical in other culturesgender pride exhibitits itself in the italian language with dottoressa poetessa and very other feminised termsequality of genders is one thing but identical identification is quite anotherthere are not only two genders either so that needs to be considered in the broader context toogender pride need not be confined to just those who identify as other
he she and itthe cgrammatically correct term for a genderless object it itwhich is not considered polite in our eversoupitself societyanother example is the way in which politeandeducated society replaced thee and thou with the plural youna ive nowt ta do with t north but they often make a lot more sense linguistically than the oxfordian grammar dictatoriat yes i made that word up 
thought youd be interested to know that in derbyshire round matlock everyone calls everyone else me duck or duck from huge hulking lorry drivers to yr old grannys werup duck p duck from a bus driver to me etc it was so shocking when i first heard it but its so charming i cant reply with duck it just never sounds right sadly
im in london and grew up in sussex i think youre right that indigenous use in britain rarely adds an s but ive only ever heard folks used in a way to introduce humour or gentle ridicule in the natural speach of southerners the folks round these parts dont like that sort of thing etc often in an exaggerated yokel gravitas i dont think thats creeping americanism to add the s necessarily
i really dislike hi guys at work just as i hated hi gents in the uk when i was one of the recipients of an email
guys probably is gender neutral in most contexts now when a waiter or waitress approaches a table of mixed diners etc ok guys is totally inoffensive in casual settings forced chummyness always grates and americanism can often come over this way especially when phrases have a sort of rehearsed robotic quality to them for a while mcdonalds insisted its british workers wished for the customer to have a nice day which always sounded hilariously hollow luckily the corporations policy is now more relaxed but i prefer my little turkish cafe by the tube where the proprietor addresses everyone with alright dahlink buddy what it be todaythe phrase i absolutely cannot bare especially when coming out of the mouth of a woman is man up
well i wouldnt attach much importance to it prompted by your question if i had to be specific i would assume you met a straight white british male in a pub on the basis that is how i am most likely to talk to strangers i would assume the same if you said i met a person last night then if any of those details were incorrect your subsequent explanation would clarify further finally the term under discussion was guys not guy not a huge distinction but about as substantive as many of the points being made
i work in schools and none of the many teachers i have observed has had to resort to calling their class guys
i get annoyed by waitstaff i know it started because they didnt want to use waiterwaitress but i wish someone had just decided to make waiter a gender neutral job designation like doctor or plumber
morning all
it never had any meaning it is just something smug and contemptible bourgeois leftists and devotees of identity politics say to comfort themselves
first point i checked my privilege says gary so he asked three from what i can tell women their opinion and because none of them flat out disagreed with him his opinion must then be valid i would caution him that there is more to checking privilege than thatsecond point i didnt read this as the three people questioned totally agreeing with gary each said either there are far more important gender inequality issues to focus on this linguistic problem and doing your best with what youve got which does not constitute agreement it expresses a degree of compromise and a need to be pragmatic which is how many women cope with gender disparity in its many forms saying there are worse problems does not mean the smaller problem is still not a problemthird point the lack of an acceptable alternative to guys is indicative of the masculine nature of the language we use that we dont have many truly gender neutral words that are inclusive and friendly because hey the reason we are even talking about this is because women havent been traditionally treated as included in a friendly way isnt that kind of the point final point guys may often be considered as gender neutral but when used in the singular i still feel that the word carries very masculine overtones i think it would be rare to say what about that guy for example and mean a woman so i think the reason guys even has some gender neutrality is because a few women were accepted in a group of men another challenge for gender neutrality is would a man refer to a group of women only as guys
you lot would work well if the intent was to have everyone you address hate your guts
unless the women concerned are nobility of britain or wives of british nobility theyre not ladies
so youd like to be called lady 
identity politics creates the kind of change we have when we change nothing of substance at all personally i avoid using gendered terms because people around me would obviously feel more comfortable but do i think it really contributes to major change in society no having clinton as president means nothing if policies stay the same for example
i would have left already
guys and mate are utterly detestable especially coming from some kid behind a counter folk american and the less we have to do with them the better you lot works quite well
its not just you its me too
many workplace emails start with the phrase hi guys perhaps hi nonpermanent dependent operatives would be more appropriate no 
thats a great case of semantics if i ever saw one it can matter but its not important thats what youre saying thats subjective im not going to have a stroke if someone refers to me as guys if im with other people but i dont like it i dont give a crap if that makes other people roll their eyes or say i should be more worried about important things because those people dont know who i am or what i do thats fine by me as a functioning adult i can care about more than one thing at a time and i dont really need people on the internet to tell me that i cant care about something because there are more important things to concern myself with interestingly these same people rarely establish their own credentials in this area so i have no way of knowing whether or not theyre forging onwards in life fixing these more important things whilst i sit here not wanting to be referred to as guys its the simplistic get a grip its just a word words cant hurt you ffs get over yourself there are more important things in life attitude thats on display here that makes me roll my eyes its just one step away from the whats wrong cant you take a joke argument it says nothing and it does nothing to make me listen to what they have to say because essentially what theyre saying is shut up we dont like what youre saying
ok so go into a roomful of republicans or british conservatives call them all comrades and see what reaction you get i think you might be surprised honey best of luck with that
ok yous guys
but what about outside of south london
nice thought but that wont work which term goes first using this ridiculous line of thinking above if you say men and women you are placing women subordinate to men which you then see in reverse if you state women and men agree with many other contributors that those critical of the term guys clearly dont have enough of importance happening in their lives nor are they aware of the some what bigger issues that exist 
before you do get a grip please make sure your hands are warm the cows prefer it and give better milk
thats a fair response backed by the datawhat are you doing here get lost on your way somewhere else and ursuppe you are correct in respect of this article but i was being more general i would suggest its in the minority of guardian articles attempting to influence society and culture however far more of their editorial bent match my initial point
yes people like you who make life difficult where it need not be youre actively adding a layer of unnecessary stress to life you can choose not to but you prefer the opposite
so ridiculous
i believe again that would be a male term women masturbate men wank in fact since you can call wanking masturbation them maybe hello masturbaters is more pc and will keep you out of trouble
so to refer to both men and women using a single title including both genders someone discriminates between the two if i refer to a group using one title im treatingconsideringacknowledging them all as equals maybe i should be referring to the group as men and women so they can read their own meaning into how i consider and value the two genders
you said if feminists are saying they want gender specific words and not be lumped in with men the word actress is already gender specific i pointed out that not all feminists say that evidently not those in the acting profession who prefer to be called actors
example i met a guy last ngihtstill a fairly common expressionso what do you take that to mean
what are they sure we dwell on trivia all the time otherwise you wouldnt be reading this its a distraction from reality stop acting all superior
this from the article if we get too pofaced about language we lose its playfulness nicely put we lose poetry and the best of prose too and we lose the ability we share with our fellow human beings to communicate in the delightful risky and dare i say flirtatious ways weve been doing for centuries i recall a marvellous episode of frasier that dealt with issues surrounding this was left feeling id rather cut off my own arm and eat it frasier fans will recognise this than have my vocabulary restrained by the political mores of our time really
if this is all that julie has got to worry about then shes doing pretty wella traditional solid semi in the better end of lower tarkington darren and dwayne in the progressive school breadwinner jeremy on the heady road towards deputy supply assistant a dyson in the cupboard under the stairs and a shiny new fiesta in the garage paradise surely its worth just a little gritting of the teeth to hang on to all this
peeps is good or you can try fam
hang on bloke this silly man telling us not to be known as guys who is he what is a guybeen called a few things and probably would have some thing to say to any one yep any one who thinks defining sexual differences with words is wrong
technically we all have african heritage perhaps addressing a group as africans would suffice
i like people who use words like guys and horror of horrors people i find that people who use terms like crass fit for use fauxchummy witless and imprecations tend to be people i like to avoid at parties but thats just me
if guys is gender neutral what do we do about the musical guys and dolls do we rename it guys and guys it would give it a whole different meaning
and this is a guardian pick how cows used to be referred to by those tending them get a grip
and your point is
i used to post on the political threads as thats where my interest really lies but most of them that are worth posting on are closed to comments thats democracy for you the glastonbury thread was quite a funny one lots of ingenuity and creative comments so worth being on this one was the best of a bad bunch this morning and the martin oneill one was so ridiculous it wasn true so dont read too much into my recent comments history i am actually very much into fairness and equality for all but i think the real issues that need to be tackled are in danger of being lost amidst the clamour for banning of certain words trying to force people to stop using what are fairly innocuous words like guys does the cause of feminism no favours at all im fairly sure ive heard germaine greer actually use guys as a generatl description
folk is a singular collective noun in english from the same route as volk naturlich but i see that youre right that folks is not necessarily incorrect i was surprised when i read that it started appearing in the th century though infrequently im not a southener i assume were both in the uk as it happens and ive very rarely if ever heard the s added by anyone further north most uk usage of folks seems more like an american import
a lot of people on this thread focus on professional vs friends contexts as if theres no middle ground i use guys with work colleagues with whom i then go to the pub theres also times when i have to tell my friends what to do as in hey guys on the count of three other than swearing and certain slang i speak the same to my mates as colleagues who are all these bilingual professional robots
surely thats not the point the relevant issue is how its used now
yes yes the punishment for saying guys and worse yet oj is eternal damnation
you sound fun
bingo it never meant anything just a made up turn of phrase to make people feel guilty about something i recently heard someone make the analogy that its the equivalent of the religious and their original sin doctrine had never thought of it that way but it is an absolutely spot on analogy the left and their quasi religious totalitarianism in full play yet again too bad they have no self awareness to see the parallels themselves
no sorryits still a pathetic excuse for a rightwing insult sheesh
yes communism is left wing no flies on you think a little bit harder so why do you think right wing people might be offended to be referred to as comrades sheesh thanks for your comments though
no right thinking person would use the word guys to describe anyone male or female and certainly wouldnt use gender as a euphemism for sex
im almost on the border and you do have a point
ya think
its nonsense like this that undermines the genuinely worthwhile work of modern feminism how is anyone expected to take this seriously from now on ill refer to any group of more than two people as snowflakes and be done with it
best of all no one can claim to be offended new round here are you 
is it ok to say hello peeps
its not a minefield gary if you have time to care about this then yes its gloriously guardian but does nothing for oppressed people wherever and whoever they are and if you feel oppressed by someone referring to a collective youre part of as guys then you have opted to be a victim never mind check your privilege check your effing perspective
calm down dear
checking your privilege has always struck me as an example of the left starting to eat itself as in its used by twats
as a tried and tested rule women are not offended by being given a name with male overtones mate bloke guy cove all lovely words denoting a benign masculinity and just as women grow up with texts in which he and his is meant to be all inclusive but it stands out like dog tits we end up feeling comfortable and even pleased with the reflected power they bestow where i have a problem is with gurl being used to describe feminine gay males the version of feminine which such gay men perform is becoming accepted as feminine behaviour across the board ie lispy pouty voices nail polish ultra submissive vapid and if i go any further ill get the chopto put it bluntly who wouldnt prefer to be called a guy over a gurlgirl
if it hasnt changed over time it soon will my three year old daughter uses it all the time they all use to refer to each other at child care when she is playing dolls with her sister they both use guys when talking with their dolls as in hey guys lets get in the car and go to its completely gender neutral for her david morrison is dealing with the past
in fairness weejhonny is not austalian of the year but judging by the actions of the current aussie of the year the threshold is rather low so who knows he may become one
i regularly check my privilegelearnt the lesson the hard way when my collection of viz magazines fell down the toilet when the last privyledge collapsed
guys is definitely gender neutral now both men and women use it when addressing groups of men and women or just men use it when addressing groups of just men or just women use it when addressing groups of just women or any other combination thereof it is basically a colloquialism for everyone personally i have never seen anyone take even the slightest offence at the word
next up breaking news the sun is hot you clearly dont live in scotland
over familiarity faux chumminess patronising not because its presuming masculine or anti feminist but because its not an address people who dont know me should be using same goes for mate pal or love
dont they know your name is heian
i find walking into the office and saying sit down children really starts the day off right i hope you dont work in a brothel
i think it does need explaining
i think it does not explaining because communism is left wing
checking privilege as you lay it out is to dismiss evidence and logical rationalisations and replaced them with anecdotal evidence lived experiences you write as a white person in a white society whose skin colour has never been an issue for anything in my entire life i cant assess the effects of racism simply from my own experienceyou are indeed correct you cannot assess the effects of racism from your own experience but neither can a discriminated against black person their experience is one persons view and too small a sample rather when trying to assess the effects of racism on must look to evidence of populations in the statistical sense as a whole one person does not a country make using check your privilege to prevent people from assessing and talking about issues which may not directly effect them is regressive for example a white man with a degree in economics and national wage data is far better placed to assess the gender pay gap than a poor black underpaid woman despite the fact the economist is more privileged and has never suffered from the pay gap while the woman suffers from it each day
in the context of this article i read it as simply meaning here is my opinion about the issue but i recognise that others eg women may have very different and equally valid views on this informed by their life experiences but ive heard it used the way you define it eg just to shut debate down and yeah not on board with that at all wrongheaded indeed
i dont think it needs explaining think of the cold war and vietnam
isnt this a good example of seeking offence it depends on how it is said as long as its a friendly intentioned reference to the team as a whole then guys is fine for me ive worked in and now work in fields dominated by men its all about intent and the use of this term is perfectly fine if its inclusive
 patronising infantilising reductive and unacceptable in the workplace i wouldnt feel the same way about boys but again im checking my privilege i think you would if you were black so good job you checked your privilege i always enjoyed the way dr cox in scrubs addressed all his interns as sports fans regardless of gender
so i met this guywhat gender do you presume
it wasa perfectly decent word derived from guy fawkes apparently which makes it interestingso example i met this guy on the street the other daywould we ever presume that to be a woman
most offputting moment when entering a restaurant with assorted companywaiter hi guys how are we all doin
people like you youre funny it must be nice to be so naive that you dont understand the power of language leaves you lots of time for the important things like commenting on the internet
owz about that then guys and gals oh dear what have i done
what language does political correctness prevent you from using what actual words be as specific as possible please
youre allowed itit looks comfortable
gordenron yes it is quite bizarre how people are reluctant to accept that men and women are actually different but they are of course otherwise why would some people need to have gender reassignment if gender differences were all just purely fabricated she my wife could not read a map to save her life one of my sisters once marveled at my extraordinary map reading skills it all just looks like spaghetti to me she said
if you go outside or on the internet and find nothing that offends you beware it means you no longer live in a free society
oh the irony of this article being under a section entitled free speech
commies and nazis are the same thing in my book what is your definition of commies if you think of soviet union and china while claiming that your post is a direct example of what i meant when i said people should to a little research on a subject before making claims about it there was nothing communist in those historical cases and they failed in the promise of communism exactly because of that the radical left hates anarchists and always has the radical left areanarchists so im struggling to say how they could hate themselves and the radical left is both patriarchal and authoritarian you clearly have a tendency to call things by names you want them to be called instead of what they are according to political theory
there is nothing wrong with offending people like there is nothing wrong with being offended its all relative what offends someone wont offend someone else as an anglo italian with an italian name i was always having the mick taken out of me at school i just shrugged it off problem with todays society is that the pc brigade have tried to take over sorry to say but generation millennial snowflake need to toughen up
yeah it annoys me the way that ethnic minorities seem to be under the impression that the reason why they sometimes have to deal with obnoxious dicks is solely down to their race some people just behave like dicks to others for a variety of reasons
she gets towards the point at the end freedom to speak means freedom to offend but it also means others are free to criticise you for it political correctness does not go mad when it criticises the rude offensive or inept but when it calls for them to be silenced by the police by facebook by universities or whatever else
at the end of the day it is better to prove somebody wrong than to silence them leftwingers should be the vanguard of freespeech but these days i feel many of them are becoming a sort of thought police who believe that if your demographic has not been historically oppressed or that if you are privileged then what ever you say is irrelevant and invalid
but it doesnt the left have for a very long time used language to oppress theres a difference between oppress and suppress everyone uses language to suppress the left is using the same toolkit as everyone else censure dismissal counterargument ridicule harsh words etc i get what youre saying that vitriol against brexit voters was frequently unreasonably extreme but that fire came in both directions and is still going on in both directions
that seems something of an artificial distinction but ok those who were instrumental in getting him to where he was then
the problem has been the brexit alf garnetts know their life well enough not to value being able to decide to up sticks and live in berlin or paris or naples because they are never going to do it they see a pole in the arndale and they think hes getting away with something that was theirs they really did not trouble themselves with how wars in western europe suddenly stopped after centuries of british youths blood soaking the soil there this mysterious customs nonsense two packs of fagsthatll do or how the european court of justice has kept boots off their faces yeah they can not do their job and let someone elses hand guide their vote through wheedling and lies but we dont have to know better to see they pissed away their countrys future like that
people in germany are not allowed to say that jews should be gassed this is mainly due to the fact that in the past people who said the very same thing went on to do what they said they would do this example used to be a somewhat over the top example to make but in todays current political environment it is a somewhat relevant one so spare us your incredibly naive and dangerous stupidity if it is going to be a case of first they came for the nazis then let them come for the nazis 
this article offends me you shouldnt have been allowed to write it see how easy it is
believe me it wont last one day shell text you to pick her up and ask you not to get out of the car so you dont embarrass her enjoy it while it lasts
when people speak about industries being predominantly influenced and run by older white men they arent speaking about every older white man in the world theyre speaking about the influence that theyve had and continue to have and how in doing so other voices who dont fit that mould arent given a fair chance to have their own influence diversity should be a welcome thing im sure nobody is blaming you personally for all the ills of the planet
they were discussing holocaust denial on the jeremy vine show last week i realise its a tricky area but surely it comes under the umbrella of hate speech
not his supporters conservative social media is alive with messages of solidarity from people of all ages and background but his financial and political backers
i am a bit confused here tha author accepts that there should be a right to offend but then seems to imply that we should not use it is there any point in having a right to do something provided we do not actually do it if the author is saying we should each try to be careful and considerate before using our right then i agree totally however if one does use a right then one cannot fairly be condemned for doing so or else it is well not a right after all
agree with you except for this point thelecture theatres at my university are my house i have part moral ownership of them no you dont others have that right of decision otherwise you are suggesting that every individual has the right to express dissent on and therefore remove any speakeropinion on the university do you want that given that you have to share that moral duty with many i assume you may disagree with
my little agitated right winger labelling people is not an argument try harder these are opinion pieces not news if someone provides a factual source to justify their opinion it is perfectly legitimate to question the veracity of those sources is that really so difficult a point to understand
thought crime a
youre right
sorry i have never resorted to abuse simply because someone doesnt agree with me but you have resorted in the post above to hectoring based on a crude oversimplification of the arguments of your opponents politically correct gone mad and some people would say that is a form of abuse
thats nonsense you can be sent to prison for using any number of words or ideas you dont even have to direct them at an individual they can be overheard by a third party who takes offence to their use do you really not know the law in this country
microaggressions is an interesting term while it purports to be part of the language of social justice its actually a piece of jargon incomprehensible to most ordinary people in fact of course its a signifier which is there to indicate that the person deploying it is a member of a particular section of the educated middle class using it is a way of excluding people not familiar with their jargon from the debate
er you clearly did not read the subheading of your own article a backlash against politically correct language ignores the deeper oppression that unchecked microaggressions inflict on groups such as women and black people which is clear evidence of the very thing you claim to be terrified of examples of microaggression guardian subeditors ignore argument in the article but write the subheading in accordance with the guardian narrative guardian picture editors notice personalitys name in article ignore articles assertion that hopkins should not appear in newspapers and put picture of hopkins at the top of article
no it isnt and the radical left hates anarchists and always has the first to be betrayed in any revolution are the anarchistsand the radical left is both patriarchal and authoritarian historically and today
i think attempts to reform language especially through shaming are partially counterproductive and partially pointless as words become negative over time and need to be changed again a year or so back the guardian ran a heartfelt article about whether or not we needed to stop using the term bame because it was no longer inclusive enough most people never started
here is the issue if the law is badly written if the law is concealing truthfacts then do those who speak outside of the law deserve to be punished think snowden and manning they made statements that changed the way we view the world should they live in exilebe in prison of course not if the law is an ass then the right thing to do is to speak against it policing human speech thought and action are impossible individuals may suffer greatly as the result of being publicly shamed and held up as enemies of the people by interest groups but what does it really achieve fear and anger poke enough hornet nests with a stick and you will be stung that is what has happened to the progressive left
im not sure i entirely agree with your opening statement im generally pretty easy going and it takes a lot of offend me most of the time however i dont believe this is a conscious choice merely how im wired equally one thing that does offend me anger me and makes me scared is a lack of tolerance and open mindedness at least when weighed against my beliefs which are for the most part were all humans we should try and live in peace without oppressing each other i agree that where possible people should take a moment and step back to analyse whats been said and where it really matters in the grand scheme of things equally the same applies to whats being said in the first place again i believe it comes down to people actually thinking and reasoning rather than simply being emotional which can be easier said that done
society should be capable of regulating itself indeed it should but where is the evidence that society has ever regulated itself in a way we would find acceptable
and that is a fair enough position to take who do you want setting the guidelines of free speech do you want our current tory government doing that can you see where that could lead to we already have complaints about the rightwing nature of our press read the numerous guardian articles about whistle blowing
what about when its religion doing the hating certain leftwing groups are alright with that because a brown skin is a trump card
but this automatic assumption that all opinions are equally valid and should be accorded equal credence is obviously nonsense i never made that claim when ultralightbeam clearly states that most of the electorate are substandard with relation to himher i believe we are entitled to know why he concludes his intelligence and the value of his opinion is higher than most of us or do you prefer to just to take his word for it
im sure they are
do you really think society would be a better place if say extremist muslim clerics were free to openly preach death to the west in public areas i remember when they did it live on television directed at salmon rushdiei dont remember any arrests though
far right writer advocating sex between older men and boys youre seriously contending that only lefties would take exception to that wow just wow
the problem is that the political correctness brigade employ their weapons in a highly selective manner while they rush to defend women ethnic minorities or gays its deemed perfectly acceptable to be ageist and antiwhite you hear the phrase pale male and stale often in the media for example and its common to see older people attacked for having disproportionately voted for brexit the author and her sympathisers do not wish to defend every persons feelings just those who fit her ideologically definition of victimhood
youre left with the problem of deciding how much harm each speech act causes and of deciding what appropriate tool should be used to deal with it who decides these things we all do just like anything else the debate ensues and then the people in the relevant positions of authority make a decision thats how our society operates at almost every level the debate that rings out at various levels is reflected to some extent in the decisions actually made an obvious example milos book gets cancelled because there is sudden widespread agreement that he has crossed a line the higherups at his publisher made the decision in part because they were tuned into the discussion if theyd researched his views independently and acted without the benefit of the discussion then they would never have signed him on in the first place since the infamous remarks were already in the public domain
i agree with you but my wife a more kindly soul than me makes the point that offence cannot be questioned ie if you say you are offended the offence is a fact and cannot be say ridiculed away i personally feel this takes insufficient account of people who go about looking for opportunities to be offended i am more than happy to oblige those people feeling that it serves them right when i were a lad there was such a thing as decency one thought twice before saying anything likely to cause gratuitous offence to individuals or groups of people whatever ones private thoughts you can call that selfcensorship if you like but it was better than having a lot of smug vigilantes leaping on you for any infraction of the rules
ok i pretty much see hard left as the same as hard right commies and nazis are the same thing in my book but the writer here i imagine to see themselves as a progressive liberal lefty not an authoritarian much of the world is now infested with extreme authoritarian politics whether its trump or kippers or le pen or hungary never mind the me and africa so it worries me that the young left has become so stridently authoritarian in response to the new mainstream nazi hegemony while being in total denial about it
are you sure supposing i were an authority figure and i was irritated by another person and exclaimed who will rid me of this troublesome priest within earshot of a number of people who are used to doing what i say would that just be words or something more akin to an incitement to violence alternatively if a person appears at an event and demands that we send all ps home in a town where there is usually an upturn in violence against minorities anytime anyone says something like that is that just free speech or incitement
words do no physical harm the roots of soviet communism hitlers reich and islamic fundamentalism prove you are demonstrably wrong about that it isnt the words but the actions taken based upon those words your solution would clearly ban marx engeles mein kampf how would we know how evil nazism is and the koran and no doubt most everything else a nightmare
this is relevant since its on the topic of free speech but what ive found odd is that theres been no robust defence of milo to be found in breitbart or spiked online those bastions of free speech who tell us that censorship is terrible and that nothing should be off limits for jokes or discussion given hes literally lost his job and money as a result youd expect this to be precisely the time for them to rally around him
there needs to be more responsibility from the media which there wont be because controversy is an income stream the media give some form of spurious respectability to people such as yiannopoulos hopkins and clarkson instead of presenting them as the extremes that they are there are similar extremes on the left but i dont get as offended by them so quickly so their names dont come to mind
in the guardian its the alt right being offended
equality is not some simple word you can wave at everything equality of what to what end in this case i would say that ideas of fairness trump ideas of equality and that the complex nature of the way that language is involved with social power makes treat everyone the same a thuggishly undernuanced solution that solves no problems at all
this argument can easily be applied to the right its not just the left who have been a bit ott with their language its every one involved i generally find the racism argument leans more towards anybody who is racist voted leave rather than everyone who voted leave is racist from my own personal experience at least and from what ive seen the insults and abuse are slung around by both sides
i agree that words have realworld effects and that if you consistently tell a group of people that they are a group of people that have a certain attribute they will internalise that which is why i really wish feminists would stop telling women that they are vulnerable oppressed sneeredupon creatures who will find rampant sexism lurking behind every door they pass through every job interview or social interaction what effect is this having on todays women might this have anything to do with the statistic muchcited by feminists that todays young women are more prone to anxiety than their predecessors and any other modern societal group
no they really cant unless you wish them too
were all so easily offended now i saw someone accidentally drop his earphones on the bus recently so i picked them up and asked a lady standing near him to hand them back to him she wasnt sure which person i meant so i said the black guy with the red bag she told me that is was unnecessary to mention his race i just thought i was being factual and meant no harm is it politically incorrect now just to describe someone
those lucky nkoreans they will never have to experience hurtful words they will never be hear or read something outrageous or offensive everyone has the same mindset how blessed they are
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening thats the problem with censorship apart from silencing the message it also destroys the evidence and then people like you think there isnt any the evidence is there if you go looking for it i did a little social experiment once and you can try it for yourself if you dont believe me i posted a statement that was mildly critical of islam on various forums and newspapers about  of the time it got deleted then i posted exactly the same statement only replacing the word islam with the word christianity  of the posts got deleted if that isnt evidence for widespread silencing of unwelcome opinions on the mainstream web media i dont know what is
dmk i wrote i dont believe in sexism woman may not be perfectible but nor is she incorrigible neither education works wonders to which you replied thank you for giving me the biggest chuckle of the morning thus far and you still didnt get the joke right over your head
bigotry is neither right wing nor left wing neither liberal nor conservative and the actuality of what you believe is irrelevant bigotry is simply intolerance of different views so when yorkerbouncer says never yet met anyone who was against political correctness who had anything worthwhile to say on a subject this is a perfect example of hisher bigotry
stories like this cling to my heart like horrible tar what was the thought process man a the dog is old and sickman b we cant afford the vets bill now at this juncture they naturally went man a let us hammer a nail into its cranium and then bury it aliveman b yes because simply letting it go leaving it herehere to be found by someone would be far too difficult the dog likely loved its owner dogs are stubbornly loyal even to their abusers what makes me sorrowful is that if that man had died alone in the cold the dog would have remained by his corpse whimpering mournfully oh boy oh boy
you dont have to buy it just buy the newspapers
deplorable nepotismshe should be reported to the police
who says whats deserving
who is asking for censorship censor ship is when the government bans someone from saying something on threat of punishment you have the legal right to say what you want but i have the right to say you cant do it in my house if you want to say it go outside to do so and an online community such as this counts as my house online thelecture theatres at my university are my house i have part moral ownership of them to say you cant say offensive things about me or my friends in my house is not censorship unless or until people are demanding people be put in prison for saying things there is no censorship
do they riot yes
exactly this philosophy was so pervasive in education that i remember having to debate with my then young children now both undergraduates that offensive thoughts and words no matter how vile are short of inciting violence or breaking the law to be allowed albeit disgreed with they were then reaching the point of policing their own thoughts and shutting down the opinions of others and this was entusiastically encouraged in school thank god we are past that point now
we all need to become trappist nuns and monks and not speak or write at all because everything that some says or writes will offend someone
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged as others have pointed out completely untrue the loudest voices against are straight male and white working class maybe its just the author is only inclined to listen to classprivileged there is a small subset of them who hold a similar view almost invariably older ones who comment about not being able to say such things any more if theres a common factor then it has more to do with being a able to remember a prepolitical correctness time
people who come to this topic just bleating its censorship its censorship like a confused dalek are contributing nothing to the debate and need to stop and think first rule dont mention the censorship
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening its not noplatforming by campuses that is the problem its the shutting up of people by unfairly labelling them as racist homophobic or misogynistic that is the problem heres an incident that caught my eye on twitter there was an ad doing the rounds for a bank lloyds if i remember it showed two men hugging with a slogan that read he said yes the implication being that these two young men had just become engaged someone tweeted the picture commenting that this was a cynical attempt by a bank to curry favour with socialmedia savvy millennials and asking where lloyds had been in the s when gay rights werent so bankable maybe a slightly cynical view of the world but not an uninteresting or invalid point apparently not the case according to jack monroe the blogger who immediately labelled this person a homophobe setting and army of twitchforks upon them in the process you cant help but feel that this sort of thing weakens the fight against genuinely harmful language
most left wing groups hate each other profoundly this is a bold statement that i feel would be difficult to back up with any kind of conclusive evidence
abis points are well made and so reasonable as to be beyond criticism sadly even her reasoned and reasonable position will be attacked by the alpha males and their female sympathisers when will people realise that we have to be wary of people like johnson trump farage nuttall and morgan
ok but your boxes dont help do they youre left with the problem of deciding how much harm each speech act causes and of deciding what appropriate tool should be used to deal with it who decides these things
the reason this comes back to left vs altright is because the only argument the latter has is that any criticism towards them is an attack on the venerated institution of free speech without any evidence to support their position its all they can do weve been too quick to accept it shutting a debate down with evidence is fine ignoring a view that has no basis in reality is fine treating such views with contempt is fine by definition they dont have the status of a supported position if you can offer evidence as to why its ok to for example say that all muslims are terrorists or that transgender bathrooms threaten your children you are still free to present it when you find it
julie bindel and her statements about grooming from about  years ago
the economic debate on the antiimmigration side is flimsy at best i can accept that manymost people on the antiimmigration side of the debate are not racist they are scared or are following party political lines your side might have to put up with some unfair accusations but that is basically the only thing going against you everything else is stacked right in your favour you should be glad yet you still moan remind you of anyone
could you say that in simpler language please i am sure that the average person like me unlike your university colleagues would appreciate it
 its just a question of when not if said policing will be used to shut you down this already happens this is how society operates we literally police each other all the time argument and counterargument is a form of policing so is shaming shunning and ridiculing people these are simply less extreme forms of policing than the uniformed police are empowered to do we all live in a giant melting pot of different constraints put on us by varying forms of social control from being interrupted or spoken over to being not invited to social gatherings because people dont like our views all the way to being booed off stage or disinvited this pervading view that we are completely free to say what we like until some students sign a petition is dangerously crude you do not have a right to offend if you offend the people around you they have various weapons of punishment you might get refused service in a shop or shouted down on a train carriage or banned from an internet forum it was ever thus
oh your and youre unforgiveable cifferatti grammar police ill come quietly you got me fair and square
you dont have the right to not be offended unless youre a brexiter in which case youll victim signal all day long when some metropolitan liberal offends you
when the freedom to offend is a freedom to harm true i often think that when this newspaper continually demonises mr trump mr farage mr nuttall and marine le pen and opens up the articles about them for discussion so that its followers can put the boot in too
theres a debate to be had about how we define free speech but as long as katie hopkins above is still getting published in a hugely popular paper its largely academic oh the irony its beyond parody it appears there is not a debate to be had about free speech you couldnt make this up orwell would be proud and most hilariously of all this appears under a picture of katie hopkins now pictured and crosspromoted by the guardian and abi hopkins agent must be laughing all the way to the bank
well said that man
then i ask you who gets to decide where the line in the sand is and how do we determine when it has been crossed
when pressure from student groups leads to speakers cancelling or being cancelled and others are no platformed this is censorship the students should be there to engage in debate not just have their opinions validated
student activists dont have the ability to stop highprofile journalists writing what they damn well please however much they might wish it were otherwise of course high profile journalists get to spout whatever they like so long as theyre not too radically outside the mainstream and suffer a coordinated attack on their character that is it is totally wrong to say the powerful progressive left i dont actually consider them to be left wing or progressive arent suppressing free speech people who agree with them can say similar but much more egregious things and they will defend them whilst attacking and essentially noplatforming someone they dont agree with for saying much less damaging things some high profile scalps have been claimed the attack on free speech freedom of expression and conscience and the right to privacy are all being attacked by the traditional right but the vocal progressive left are not fighting this instead their energies are being placed fighting microaggressions and so they are tacitly and even implicitly in some cases supporting the rights attack on freedoms by choosing to focus on ever greater policing of language theyre contributing to the atmosphere of orwellian thought crime if high profile people can be damaged in this climate think what it is like for ordinary people people who cannot speak openly about the reality of their situation without being shouted down as racist or xenophobic despite the fact they are trying to speak out about suffering from the very things they get accused of who cant talk about misogynist or homophobic abuse they suffer because they are not part of the progressives prescribed victim groups if youre a poor white male suffering from sexism and racism both systemic and cultural well you cant possibly be anything other than a sexist and racist because wealthy white men still control everything this deliberate class myopia coupled with a deep disdain and hatred even of working class whites by progressive opinion writers has created a nasty culture that has trickled down to all sections of society the idea that buzzfeed or mtvs pithy little problem with white people skits hasnt had an affect in the real world is laughable racial violence and hate speech against poor whites is on the increase and worse it is also seen as justifiable by perpetrators because the white people are so terrible and caused every problem in the world ever is pushed by wealthy white opinion writers who live in wealthy mainly white areas and do not have to deal with the fallout from the anger theyre stirring up im sorry but i cant see any difference between the right and lefts totalitarianism right now theyre both contributing and supporting the current climate that is policing every section of ordinary peoples lives if youre relatively welloff then it probably hasnt affected you but try and use a bit of empathy and realize how it is affecting most people of course in this climate people who break the mold and speak against political correctness are to be supported even if you personally find what they say reprehensible because the biggest problem right now is the totalitarianism that has taken hold of our society once you police speech to the point people can lose their jobs face violence condoned by the mainstream or even prison then you police peoples thoughts and that is the most oppressive and psychologically damaging authoritarianism
and words will leave deep psychological wounds that will never heal
do you really think society would be a better place if say extremist muslim clerics were free to openly preach death to the west in public areas what do you mean if they are free to openly preach death to the west anjem choudary did it for more than a decade and only had his collar felt when he got sloppy and crossed the line between preaching death to the west and actively aiding daesh the hypocrisy is that if i stood on a street corner shouting antiislam slogans i would last an hour at most before getting my collar felt even if every slogan i shouted was based on a passage from the quran or a recognised hadith returning to my original point either we should be allowed to offend everybody or nobody the hate speech laws draw a distinction between what it is alright to criticise and what it isnt this distinction should not exist theres no justification for it im just about alright with the idea of criminalising racist hate speech but criminalising the dislike of an ideology i find deeply sinister why should i be banned from hating an ideology simply because its based on a thousand year old book and was allegedly dictated by angels or gods or a three eyed raven
you know the reason that student was picked outright they the student had chosen to make themself a public figure through pursuing a legal case against the university to enable themself and others whatever the merits of the case this wasnt randomly selecting an individual out of a crowd to pick on nevertheless that removes the thrust of my argument either you allow the mocking of an individual or none or you start having guidelines about who you cancannot mock which leads you down authoritarian rabbit holes in my mind you are free to mock whoever but if you are picking on someone because of of their characteristics i hope the world judges you as an arsehole however even in that milo example he is an arsehole for picking on an individual he is not mocking transgendered people as a group
no he wasnt he has always said he is from a middle class family
words can and do do harm the various defamation acts are very clear on this that it is not by itself physical harm does not make it ok as a careless or malicious word can expose someone to a very real risk of physical harm case in point the paediatrician driven out of her home by illiterate vigilantes also if you read the article above words can and do cause physical harm how many women are driven to eating disorders and selfharm by words how many glbt people suffer mental and physical harm as a result of words how many people have been exposed to real danger by doxxing having their home address posted in the hope that harm might arise to the victim if anything words are far far more harmful than sticks and stones you can only injure or kill a few people with a stick but words can be used to persuade people to kill millions thats why the pen is mightier than the sword
thats effective against all offensive comment why single out the alt right
the only country people in the british armed forces serve is some of the usayour big bossuseful people but hardly patriotici think a us president called them friendly fools but i havent checked the esorry if i offended you with that post
tough their parents should have taught them sticks and stones
big breaths 
thats just like youre opinion man
well i think my irony meter has exploded
a thousand likes to you
a huge part of being a lefty is respecting education using terminology with care for transmitting accuracy is a key pillar of our movement trump gets away with his narcissism most successfully when he says you take me too literally and not seriously enough and rightwing supreme court judges do enormous harm when they take the constitutions words twist them ridiculously the right to bear arms in a militia a mitlitia in every home and then say i used the words exactly as they said them fighting this is important
trans women are a type of woman but not the same as a woman born as a woman which is exactly what chimimanda said
i openly admit that i need to be re educated because i dont know how to pronounce cis does it sound like siss or kissim lost in this new world
maos china wants its lunatic busybodies back
thats the guardian for you couldnt resist
and there is the problem in a nutshell the problem being that most arguments about excluding trans women are irritatingly unreasonable and senseless yes youve got it and the arrogance of joining a movement for women only to tell us that we dont have the right to define what being a woman is thats not joining in thats a take over who said i was joining in im on the outside of your movement telling you that i will support it so long as it has the moral high ground and i will oppose it if it stoops so low as to exclude women on the basis that theyre trans
what you mean that you didnt discuss intersectionality and cis im stunned i mean how on earth can you expect the modern and extremely progressive labour party to connect with you i mean how on earth can you expect them to actually want your vote jeez i mean come on
all of these terms are designed to inform the audience perceived or otherwise that they are not part of a group typically the group allowed to share their experiences with others in the course of discussion this is particularly egregious when the interests of the gay community run perpendicular to those of the trans community and they do with some frequency gays are labeled as cis which is of course wholly ridiculous they may not be trans but its hardly fair to say that gays enjoy a lot of comfort in their skin even today this language of separation is how you allow yourself to be divided your movement stalled and your impact minimized there is a corollary in orthodox language whereby the prohibition on the use of words gives those words the power those who enact the prohibitions wish to deny
indeed this is one of the most dangerous parts of the article that dogmatic statement that adichie has a flawed opinion and that she needs to be given opportunity to change that opinion this opportunity to change her opinion brings to mind the forced confessions and the show trials that were so prevalent in soviet russiaeastern europe and in communist china the dissident is arrested then a few days later appears on national tv to announce that they were in fact wrong and that the communist state is in fact all knowing and benevolent and that the people should be grateful alexander dubceks pronouncements following his arrest and release after the soviet invasion of czechoslvakia is a case in point
its supposed to mean anyone who identifies with the gender thy were assigned at birth whatever that means i thought we were just born male female or sometimes intersex and we grew up to develop our unique personalities
delicious stuff both above and below the line if you want to howl with laughter at the state of the left today
saying a male is the same as a female is my idea of gaslighting
they can have their hoops ill take brick buildings central heating electricity and long haul flights
not in the context of the pissing contest adichie inspired about whether trans women could call themselves women no but yes working class men in particular are continually being told to check their privilege by wealthy middle class oxbridge graduates who are then shocked when working class men vote against the establishment that tells them their relative poverty is of no concern compared to other peoples disadvantages that too is a good example of some people on the left the guardian left being more interested in factionalism and exclusivity than building a coalition of the disenfranchised
youre statement is pure gaslighting trans women are women even adichie said this in the criticized interview saying its bleedin obvious that trans women arent women and everybody agrees is gaslighting its also evidence that you dont understand transing and you are super confident  that you do understand transing and you can be the decider of it please now study the dunningkruger effect and get yourself some lemonjuice
the position which requires that someone of adichies intellectual heft to change their flawed opinion is the problem here not the issue of whether or not they are allowed to or not adichie is someone who has thought and written about these issues more than most why do we not take her words at face value and perhaps even listen to them
once collective action finally gets its butt in gear what is collective action and how long have the left been waiting for it
what is a female identity
the modern left would usually do best by remaining totally silent rather than bastardising the language with their own bizarre usages and preaching haughtily to others who fail to conform to them an everchanging pcapproved lexicon for the slightly aggrieved doesnt create itself you know and who else is going to contemptuously look down on the rest of us from the impossibly high moral ground if not them i think that you may be undervaluing these essential tasks somehow
everything we disagree with is bigoted now
a great e from the times today on the vexed question of whether white women should be allowed to wear hoop earrings or alternatively whether this should be forbidden due to it involving cultural appropriation a protester declared if you didnt create the culture as a coping mechanism for marginalisation take off those hoops if your feminism isnt intersectional take off those hoops if you try to wear mi cultura my culture when the creators can no longer afford it take off those hoops if you cant pronounce my name or spell it take off those hoops i use those instead of your because hoops were never yours to begin with my hoop earrings have remained in place httpwwwthetimescoukarticlegoingthroughhoopsisjustwrongwhitewomentoldfcvxwvz
she said theres a difference between women who were born female and transwomen this is a simple statement of fact
those on the left who are most vocal about linguistic orthodoxy have little or no authentic experience of those they purport to be representing bright red bellends
its about language as a way to police opinion stalin was good at that
just like krushchev denounced stalin we now need folks like corbyn sanders rocky anderson the greens etc etc to make a call an enormous conference in london at marxs grave and simultaneously totally denounce lenin and all the falseleftness of sovietism
i am a bloke i was born a bloke have always been a bloke i wear trousers and have a dick i suppose in left wing la la land i would be referred to as a cisgender male i prefer to be called a bloke consider me oldfashioned
its true that this is about language but not in the way you claim nobody would mind if you cant use the right words like intersectionality or cis but respect trans women their life experience and the language that they themselves use to describe those experiences this is where many highly educated cis women have problems since the women whinging about overly academic language here are themselves writers journalists and academics most of the time hardly people who cant educate themselves on the meanings of two simple concepts these activists cant accept that trans women should be allowed to describe their own lives and experience they insist that cis people are the ones with the right to assign the proper labels for trans womens reality
i know what you mean although im not quite so sure i think some of them certainly on the more academic and learned side deliberately use opaque obscure overly academic language to mask their intent or in the case of this article nice caring language airing a flawed opinion without being given the chance to change that opinion obviously the other trick is saying that nobody has ever actually tried what theyre advocating soviet union nah not my leftism
i dont think that anyone is claiming that trans women arent real just that they arent women they are people of one sex feel that they belong to the other and who therefore choose to live their lives as and often physically change themselves to resemble the other sex nothing wrong with that each to their own
if youre going to present yourself as deserving special treatment for being nonprivileged you cant really complain when someone else asks you to check your privilege on a vector where you have it and they dont
for the answer we can turn to lenin no we can never get the answer from lenin he was not as bad as hitler as a political thinker and activist but he was pretty high on the same metrics
lenin replaced food requisitioning with the nep though he was hardly an intransigent dictator delighting in the starvation of people and i dont think you can blame him for the weather which led to the  famine
so instead of being born female and enduring the automatic suffering that entails future trans women as physically male are told by society that they would be worse than women if they chose to give up the male status and deliberately become lesserstatused the implication is bornwomen have an excuse to be lesser trans women dont even have that excuse so you deliberately chose to lessen yourself thats the worst possible but adichie says these people have suffered less maybe we should say she doesnt understand their suffering
spot on
its useful in certain discussions its quite demoralising when talking about about your own identity to refer to other identities as normal or conventional cis is fairly neutral sounding and doesnt marginalise what i dont understand is why it upsets people
from a linguistic perspective i agree thats how language works however it terms of discourse it can stifle thought by allowing someone to avoid justifying their claim a complicated debatable idea gets presented as a fait accompli im pretty sure orwell complained about this as a side note getting people to justify their beliefs got a lot harder the day some jerk invented the phrase its not my job to educate you
i think that some on the left actively dislike the people they purport to represent the utter distain expressed by some about largely poorer and disadvantaged brexit supporters with some claiming them to be unintelligent to the extent that they should be denied the vote doesnt sit well with any notion of standing shoulder to shoulder with your comrades the authoritarian view that those socially superior to the masses know what is best for the rest is reflected in the insistence on a different and alienating vocabulary it is interesting to see lenin ed i cant help thinking that if he is your best inspiration your chances of electoral success yes we have elections now are going to be limited
i cant agree that having no problem with the gender assigned at ones birth represents privilege
all you need to know is that according to the liberal left words can now mean whatever you want them to mean and if people question this or can no longer understand what youre on about youre a bigot and a phobe who needs to check your privilege
we dont need to abandon our language because it isnt instantly recognisable to most people we just need to explain it and well keep on explaining it and explaining it until they say they agree with us just to shut us up
its because adichie has been anointed the chosen one by this organs feminist brigade and theyre since spitting feathers that shes said something not as righton as they had hoped its like seeing your dad cry
is th march the postmodern st april
i sincerely hope that you mean this in an inclusive and nonjudgemental way that fully recognises the rich diversity of wankerdom
its a lot of shite though how is white folks saying woke not cultural appropriation but then denying it is a lot of shite as well because how am i telling anyone what to say and not being both  aware of an issue and simultaneously doing violence by scilencing another its impossible to be correct on all fronts at all times i suppose the most i can offer is nazi punks fuck off
the experiences of british men and women overlap that doesnt mean there isnt a distinction correct however do their experiences overlap in a way that is pertinent to the tenets of feminism no men are on the wrong side of the equation to have direct experience of the kind of sexism that has given rise to feminism trans women on the other hand do have experience of it hence why barring them from joining in the same cause as cis women is silly
lenin and pals killed tens of millions the modern left has only killed its own credibility and therefore any chance of democratic success this is an improvement
im very happy to hear your counterargument except im not really because ive probably heard it before and its shit and there is the problem in a nutshell and the arrogance of joining a movement for women only to tell us that we dont have the right to define what being a woman is thats not joining in thats a take over
right here is the issue adichie saying trans women arent real women and havent had the suffering thats a real bigoted statement writing to instead of too and then getting criticized for it thats the ridiculous part
from this white straight mans perspective women suffer prejudice black people suffer prejudice and trans people suffer prejudice do men not suffer prejudice
its about  language orthodoxy nah ill just stick to english comprehension thank you
 similarly cis is a useful shorthand word to name a kind of gender privilege which is barely recognised in mainstream culture as even existing a truly amazing statement in an article wondering whether lefties alienate people by the language they use as selfparody this is pure comedy gold
heh all you need is that life of brian sketch its as applicable to bernie bros vs hildogs and corbynistas vs red tories as it ever was in the s
the left mustnt get hung up over language orthodoxy we must be welcoming its far too late for that the left is over it is now seen as virtually indistinguishable from a fascist movement with its obsessions with policing thought and speech and demanding ever increasing censorship of the population amp media and its going to get worse not better for the left
being right rather than productive is certainly a cancer on the socalled left but the fact that this phenomena tends to be encouraged by corporate and elite sources rather than the grassroots suggests that its sway over leftdemocratic politics will fade once collective action finally gets its butt in gear a near certainty given the continuing draining of resources from the general public into the hands of the plutocracy
its not that people outside the political left are too stupid to understand words like intersectionality indeed its the opposite intersectionality is a word used and taken seriously only by idiots
the experiences of british men and women overlap that doesnt mean there isnt a distinction
you make many excellent points ellie sadly my pessimism tells me that in the time were living in noone left or right progressive or conservative is looking for converts but to sow division instead
what abuse stating what  of people take to be selfevident that trans women are not the same as women is not abuse
yes imagine farage saying for the answer we can turn to hitler
a lot of thats very specifically about the party memberships anger about labours current position on brexit not anything to do with the issues raised in the article
thats right its all about you you were the person i had in mind while typing and you are the biggest victim of my awful attack

well yes the prefix has been used academically i have never encountered it in my academic studies a lot of which has been devoted to cultural gender and identity politics
oh no a single fb share out of literally several million per day has damaged the entire progressive movement talk about hypocrisy
spot on
lefties are the least welcoming bunch about apart from everyone else of course
and lets be honest half of the lifestyle liberals who use this kind of jargon do so because its an easy way of identifying and pushing away people from different backgrounds and dismissing whatever they might have to say tragic that theyve got such a hold on the nonrightwing media that its dragging the rest of the left down with them
it isnt clear why adichie is claiming that language orthodoxy is the problem when her controversial statement doesnt contain any technical vocabulary i think the author might also want to be alive to the fact that a lot of this vocabulary has theoretical commitments behind it so if cis identifies a kind of privilege and doesnt simply identify people who are not trans then the use of the word entails the claim that nontrans people are privileged for people who disagree with this and im not one of them it isnt just that the term is a new and unfamiliar piece of shorthand it is rather that the use of it entails a set of commitments they disagree with
i was enjoying a pint and a chit chat with the blokes down the miners welfare club the other night after a while the talk eventually turned to politics big george a large man with a surprisingly high gentle voice piped up what labour need to do is to reconnect with the ordinary working man and the best way to do that is through a mixture of identity politics and the works of lenin we all laughed and carried on drinking
whats the plain fucking english term for cis there isnt one
so what youre saying is that adiche had the ideologically incorrect opinion and its just a matter of reeducating her with the correct terminology meanwhile what she said was a simple statement of fact transwomen are transwomen hence trans they do not have the same experience of being born and raised female in a world that has discriminated against females on the basis of our sex for centuries this is a simple neutral fact you cant preach intersectionality but only when its convenient to you if you were born male regardless of how you identify or regardless of any of your other struggles you have male privilege i just find it mind boggling that all these white males whove only been identifying as women since last week have come out to condemn a black woman for oppressing them and demanding that she check her privilege ludicrous
got it
you see them as the extreme remainers on every brexit article
thats not a problem at all thats language functioning properly the terms are shortcuts to concepts if someone talks about cultural marxism or internalised misogyny you know exactly where theyre coming from and can explain to them whether or not you disagree with their premise voila debate
shes airing her opinion multiple times all over the place no one is stifling her refusing point blank to acknowledge a word exists as she did with cis does rather have the feel of stifling however

any inclusionary politics can be used to exclude once we see ourselves as somehow better embodying a platform of acceptance than someone else then we have started to miss the point entirely give the girl a break how many of us are truly aware of all our biases be careful when chasing monsters as nietsche said
lefties are the least welcoming bunch about so militant they spend half their time attacking each other for not being progressive enough it damages the cause and moves mainstream voters away

i have no idea what gadlighting means so i guess im one of the people for whom the language of the left is saying fuck off too
the vocabulary is changing because the left is losing the intellectual argument there is no oppression only privilege there is no exploitation only classism there are no alliances only allies there is no consciousnessraising only callingout etc the left is losing and its time is almost up the rise of the postnew left is a reactionary shift from collectivism to narcissism
yup its a career that actually contributes to human wellbeing totally unlike all those liberal arts numpties being pumped out of third rate universities
rotwatcher is correct in my opinion global warming is a chinese hoax technically thats not an opinion it might be a belief whether acknowledged or no i believe that global warming or a statement of fact whether correct or not global warming is but an opinion is statement about a hypothesised presumed or established fact not a statement of one as such since it is a statement of how the opiner personally regards something it cant have a truth value of its own it could be your opinion that global warming is most likely a chinese hoax in which case youre making a statement about how you regard the evidence for the assertion
i found that statement astonishing gives the game away this isnt about language at all
well disappointed and disagree do not share the same meaning do they disappointed is being poorly used much as inappropriate is misused as meaning wrong and liquid engineering is used instead of oilpeople are afraid of using clear english because of its power
hilarious this article about the evils of language orthodoxy is actually pretty spot on of course if one were to note that this language orthodoxy the author speaks of is actually just a fancier word for the political correctness folks have been complaining aboutwell youre probably a misogynistic trump supporter
to say that the modern left faces challenging times is a gross understatementfor the answer we can turn to leninjesus christ the lack of self awareness is breathtaking turning to the neverelected totalitarian butchers of the soviet union for answers and advice

i really think that there are quite a few more important issues that need tackling before solving any form of perceived anti female bias in the english language although i have always thought that the still continuous high profile use of mankind really offensive to women and in this post feminist world wonder why it hasnt been eradicated
well finns may be less sexist but it has nothing to do with language iranians and turks though lol
is this satire or serious
you is ambiguous as it can be either plural or singular in practice it doesnt cause a problem on the contrary it causes constant problems so much so necessity being the mother of invention that progressive speakers have found it expedient to introduce the nd person plural youse or yall relegating you to singular personally i find the need to address genderless individuals is so rare that i can easily restrict they to the plural without falling into the use of gender specific language applied to anyone not of a specific gender
hopefully not sounds like the sort of submissive brainwashing shit that only belongs in america
traditionally using the plural for a single person has been used to show respect thats how thou and thee died out
still sounds shit and illiterate and always will
whatever happened to she it was always difficult to pronounce good riddance but lets get to world hunger before we set our hair on fire over nothing yes i said nothing
all pronouns have suffered from ambiguity and we deal with them the best way of dealing with ambiguities is to evolve the language to eliminate them in fact left to their own devices progressive speakers have developed youse and yall to fill the void left by the loss of the nd person singular pronouns sadly the youse forms is not available to me and i do get such funny looks when i thou people this isnt an argument against using they as a singular allgenderembracing pronoun sure it is and you have just seen it deployed your counterargument that the difficulties of ambiguity already experienced justify introducing still greater impediments to communication seems the less persuasive to me the other point is that it is very rarely necessary to talk to a genderless individual most individuals have a gender one can use he or she as appropriate and when talking about classes of individuals the plural is the more appropriate if there exist individuals who prefer to be addressed as they we can certainly humour them but that is no reason to introduce even more pronoun ambiguity into the language generally especially if it serves no real purpose apart from a form contract where the admittedly ugly heshe form suffices im hard pressed to think of any use case for a gender neutral singular pronoun now if we were talking about introducing spivak pronouns 
prescribed language given from authority sounds like orwellian nightmare to me controlling and restricting thought through controlling language
 until english is spoken in a world where the inherent power disparity between the hes and shes is eradicated were already in that world there is no inherent power disparity between those terms however there is still an actual power disparity in life thats the thing that needs to be addressed
yes languages evolve and in doing so they can replace singular pronouns such as thou thee and thine with you and your it happens
if the solution is a simple as using they is the problem really a problem in the first place
rubbish rubbish rubbish i want to be he want my wife and lovers be she not they this is the limit
ha ha its true frequent use of ne is a dead giveaway gendered speech is a completely separate can of worms although i did know one norwegian girl who sounded like a  year old boy in japanese just like her boyfriend
when youre done with this have go at the french language
it actually sounds weird or even creepy if you write it out in some cases eg my mother was always very beautiful they always wore nice clothes even when they took me to school in the morning from them i learnt about fashion i owe my career as a hat model to them
fine covers polygamists too
not when there is a bold italic and e right below the box
so much more efficient to advertise for a female actor rather than an actress why use one word when two can mean the same thing and help strangle the language at the same time
i was always told that was rude as child and can still remember the admonishment that accompanied it they are the cats motheras in it was dehumanizing to use that form of address
try it in a romantic description and it sounds they are my everything their beautiful smile and eyes make my heart jump i want to start a family with them and make all their dreams come true i love them
this has not prevented traditional hungarian culture from being patriarchal and sexist the genderless languages mentioned above including hungarian have their roots in central asia and siberia where the nomadic warrior societies of the time lived on the equal share of duties rights and responsibilities of women and men these nations have gradually lost their primitive social order when their westward migration urged the adoption of monotheistic religions preaching patriarchy at the extreme
they sounds wrong grates on the ears when referring to a single known person it sounds natural enough when referring to a single unknown person
oh its in the article sorry
someone here once said we are sexist for using he and she mr and mrs all the time they have their gendered sentence enders for women though loadsa male japanese learners end up sounding feminine cos they learn fromwomen right
 plurals are neuter its les for everythingnot neuter at all the gender in plural nouns is reflected by the gender agreement of adjectives or other parts of speech that refer to the plural nounou sont les belles dames du temps jadis
does it take sugar
what is the author proposing here that we do away with he and she altogether i think in some instances where the pronoun is referring to a specific person he or she works fine for example mary bought my old ford i hope she likes it replacing she with they in the second sentence is just awkward and distracts from the meaning of the sentence however if you said someone just bought my old ford i hope they like it that sentence makes sense using they instead of he or she whats more i thought that usage was standard english long before anyone ever tried to make the english language less sexist
i decide how i refer to people if people are offended they should get a grip he or she is not the n word
interesting that this is being discussed now i was always told at school that they should be used for when the sex is unknown i thought that was universal although it might be one of those ingrained things in my brain that i dont notice i remember recently reading a teaching text though that was using she and her as the standard couldnt figure out if it was trying to make a statement or if my area is more populated with women than men
the plural of you is youz guys in the us its yall or all yall if theres a whole bunch of yall
winniethepooh author aa milne once wrote if the english language had been properly organised there would be a word which meant both he and she and i could write if john or may comes heesh will want to play tennis which would save a lot of trouble im triggered by the suggestion that john is always a male name hurr hurr if john or may comes they will want to play tennis this is how any normal person would of solved this problem already without even thinking about it this is such a nonissue we have so many words in the english language so many different ways of expressing things we already have solutions and ways of saying things often i cant think of the right word for this is solved by just restructuring a sentence or changing the order of things but in the rare case where you are truly without a fitting word to use to imply male or female there is always the old trusty he or she or she or he we can just agree to alternate which gender comes first so that no ones feelings get hurt since we obviously must be as sensitive as an atomic clock to gender issues now if this really truly matters to anyone other than academics
probably for the best after enough cousin marriages im sure you get all sorts of weird and wonderful gender configurations springing up

are schoolkids and soldiers still allowed to say yes sir or yes maam its a long time since i was a soldier and even longer since i was a schoolboy schoolchild schoolperson or whatever so im just curious as to how you address your superior officer nowadays if you dont know its name and it does seem a shame if rumpole is no longer allowed to address the judge as mlud apart from the sheer richness of the sound i doubt mad bull bullingham would appreciate being called mlady
apologies
and cultures with genderless language are examples of gender equality
you are wrong on both counts from the perspective of actual linguistics there is no reason why he should not be fine for an animate object of ambiguous gender and there is nothing grammatically incorrect about using a plural form in english the verb is unmarked and really thats all there is to it they may be a plural but there is no plural marking on english verbs other than in the third person singular it is quite simple to have a singular they as well languages like german spanish and french manage it perfectly well with their tv forms spanish and french even use the plural marked ending
japanese speakers dont use he or she karekanojo much in speech they prefer to use names or titles instead no sexism here folks nopey nope no gender discrimination whatsoever its a bloody feminist utopia
just wanted to point out one thing languages evolve theyre not designed to be sexist or have any other agenda yes language does evolve however language evolves within a social context and reflects the values mores and social norms of the people speaking language has context so certainly language does reflect societal attitudes and therefore will inevitably reflect sexism in the community
what has always interested me and naturally escaped the attentions of assorted feminists and critical theorists is that commonly used names for men down the ages very often seem to be related to their station in life we have husband householder boy servant churl freeman while women do get named after their sexual organs a lot they do get the privilege of being named in ways that describe the actuality of being a woman rather than just what their utility is in the economy names for men relating to an intrinsic masculinity seem to die out in feudal times at least like were did the political message is that we do not have value unless as we act as providers

this writer is lucky to live in britain and not saudi arabia then she might understand that she complaineth too much they are not amused
one could say there is already a genderless pronoun in english
it is the default its what people use men and women i agree its dumb there are more women than men in the first world at least except i think currently worldwide there are fewer women because men have been killing them at a higher rate lately more of us are born and more survive due to the inherent genetic superiority of the xx chromosome over the xy in terms of health so the default should be female if you had to pick a gender at all
with a first known use in the s chair has been used longer than chairman to describe someone presiding at a meeting those pesky pc puritans must have destroyed our language back in the th century how about learning something about the history of english usage before making an ignorant comment on the issue
theres a bit of wheel reinventing going on here in many languages the equivalent of he and she are used as familiar terms you use them only with people you know well everyone else gets the equivalent of they i really dont get this sexism thing in english we have three genders male female and neuter in other languages such as french theres only two male and female languages evolve theyre not designed to be sexist or have any other agenda this kind of complaint though is actually asking us to use newspeak a dialect of english that precludes us being able to express and so harbor impure or improper thought be careful what you wish for
im capable just consider it inappropriate in this instance
then i trust you dont offend our language by using you as a singular pronoun
another strong takedown of the pahllocentric manocracy high awaited
you is also a plural pronoun ill bet that doesnt stop you using it for singular
so would you always refer to a hilary or a shirley as he given that they are male names
i like to whom it may concern though ive been told it comes off as stuffy
good lord i cant believe how such a relatively small amount of alcohol has rendered me so inebriated blahuur 
very true fula has  noun classes httpsenwikipediaorgwikinoun_classnigerecongo_languages
you is also plural that doesnt stop the vast majority of native english speakers using it to replace the singular form thou
the problem with they as a singular is that the word already has a common useas a plural this has not been a problem for you indeed few people even realise that you was originally plural only the singular second person pronoun thou is now rarely used outside of yorkshire
if you use they as singular then you can use themselves as singular too problem solved indeed most people dont see this as a problem themselves is in common use as a singular form
modern english also has a genderless word for a person it is person
actor and priest are not masculine nouns and never have been besides youre a few decades behind the evolution of english actor has been used to describe women for many years priests is also now used to refer to women
you are prince charles and i claim my prize
the joy of a living language is its ability to reflect our endlessly changing social relationships the move use plural forms for singular functions is neither new nor confined to pronouns nor is it confined to english think of the shift in french pronouns ive used the genderneutral form they for singular functions in academic papers for the past couple of decades initially it seemed sensible to footnote a weak usage of the word for clarity and community acceptance but for the last  years this has been unnecessary they for singular meaning is now accepted in academia the bastion of conservation verbs are also shifting to singular forms particularly in abbreviated spoken grammar so theres a lot of people on the train this morning is a widely accepted grammatical usage communication changes relentlessly to simple forms as new demands arise texting words such as fyi originally driven by message economics are now part other written genres the move to reduced choice of genders pronouns has a conscience base in the social demand for equality it is more fundamentally driven by wider language phenomena
you could try greek ah but boy girl and child are all neuter so that doesnt work or maybe russian but then again man is a feminine word though to be fair the pronoun is masculine
we have a dialect usage here in somerset of the construction theym they am it can be either singular as in heshe is or plural as in they are the second person youm may also be used how about a conjugation like this for conversational and idiomatic use singular im youm theym plural were youretheyre for formal writing simply use am for singulars and are for plurals
no exactly the same has happened with plural you coming to be used for the singular too we say you are rather than you art
they can just fuck off
ive been using they like this for years it just seems an obvious thing to do the only person that noticed was my wife but shes an english teacher and just possibly the only person who pays attention to my wittering
hi thank you for a well written reply i think we can both agree at least that if youre going to write a book using he correctly for better or for worse as a gender nonspecific pronoun you should absolutely not switch to using she just because of percentages the only situation i can see in which this is acceptable is if its  certain to be a female in question such as a situation in which a patient is giving birth when he is still technically correct but is absurd and unnecessary if its even theoretically possible for a man to have an eating disorder which of course it is then i think you should continue to use the pronoun he i have to disagree completely that there is any implication about the gender from using the he pronoun i think this is simply a matter of fact you might make the implication but the language does not the langugae is not airily erasing people from the narative you are or we are if we make such assumptions whether we like it or not or whether we think its stupid or proper or whatever else in between this i see as just a fact it is the rules of the language which we might like to change or not but as things stand if we make arbitrary assumptions we should be prepared to be wrong i can see that its not ideal and that people might not like it but thats really just how it is on the point of having to do a mental dance with regards to he i accept that as a male and with what i assume is a natural human instinct to see people as being like myself im not best placed to appreciate this but really i have trouble seeing when it really comes down to it that this isnt just a problem of the crappy practically nonexistent education most of us get in the english language in this country i dont really remember doing any english grammar in school and we certainly didnt cover this point basically i feel and i can see why you might disagree that if we were more used to it it really would not be tiring and for me gender is less important than number im pretty sure if she were the pronoun and schools had taught me such and properly exposed me to its usage i would not have to do a mental dance every time i encountered it i mean why should we even care what gender the psychiatrist is in your example why do that dance im not surprised if i sit down to play a game of chess against a woman or even a young girl just because the chess books talk about players as he and most players are male and my age or older if i make such assumptions its my fault for being surprised presumably if were doing that dance its because we spend far more time in the informal than in the formal even someone who has to read a  page academic tome in its entirity i guess our internal monologues are always informal but then why not rebel against being forced to use the word cannot which i dont think i ever use informally but somehow does still sound better in a formal context than cant imagine how tiring it would be to read a  page text with an entirely new pronoun shoehorned in or how impractical it would be to print every text with male and female versions i see your last sentence and its clever and to the point but i just cant see it as anything other than just so incredibly neat and cool that english lets us talk in such a correct and concise manner without having to resort to all this she heshe he or she or xxx or another superfluous pronoun or whatever whenever i see such a sentence i just cant help but mentally congratulate the writer in a world of people who cant even choose correctly between i and me and in fact dont even bother to make the attempt preferring to be wrong  of the time with myself i just cant help but think well done bravo sorry
and yet in america yall has increased in use as a plural the equivalent in trinidad my mothers country is allyuh
me too self and people i speak to surely were not that ahead of the curve are we
there is no need to fracture language by using plural instead of singular so what do you use as a second person singular pronoun i assume that you dont use the plural you so you must still be using the singular thou art thou conjugating is correctly
true but its katharevousa
no more odd than using the plural form you for a single person
it is a detriment to society that this sort of nonsense is being taught in tax payed funded universities there is petition for these sort of classes to be peer reviewed as to their merit and if they have any scientific basis httpswwwchangeorgpuniversitiessuspendsocialjusticeinuniversitiesfor an interesting comedic takehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgyogtaohhly
i disagree with the use of plural forms for a singular pronoun simply because of the confusion caused as to the number of persons referred to so how do you differentiate between the second person singular and plural i assume you disagree with the use of the plural you for a singular pronoun
it is simply grammatically incorrect to declares someone who is clearly ignorant of english grammar
we didnt as the article points out even chaucer was using they as a genderless singular pronoun
i and everyone ive ever conversed with in my sofar half century of life have used they as a singular genderless pronoun am i missing something
women were excluded from important discussions so it wasnt a problem isnt that the point
theres a four letter word that comes to mind that could solve so many problems in the modern world that word isnt what you think it is its the word blah just think about it is there any problem or point of contention in our society that cannot be carefully handled by long sequences of the word blah the news industry approaches all manner of problems and issues like this regularly but only metaphorically we must do much more to tackle all the challenges and injustices that everybody faces from various angles and long strings of the word blah are a great starting point and so on
it so happens that hungarian only has one pronoun he she and it translate to the same wordthis has not prevented traditional hungarian culture from being patriarchal and sexistthere is no need to fracture language by using plural instead of singular it is attitudes that need changing not wordsbesides using plural can lead to ambiguity readhttpsbobrichwordpresscombobbingaroundvolumenumberwriting one e two of the three children threw tantrums the little blonde grew blue in the face and i worried they might suffer an injury who might the blonde or both of them

you have to wonder how we managed all these centuries without it
surely this is insensitive to a person suffering from schizophrenia
it takes a lot of energy to work up a good lather on political correctness gone mad in which lazy conservatives love to loll so if those people are ticked off by words its their problem but if other people are ticked off by words they must be accommodated
the only objection to they is that its plural but this isnt a problem as you is also both singular and plural in addition you is even often used instead of the pronoun one which may feel too impersonal as in if you want to succeed you have to be positive in the case of the queen even we is both singular and plural i say free the poor pronoun
the indirect articles of der die and das only refer to the gender of nouns english naturally doesnt have this but they arent used to refer to the personal pronouns of he she or it these would be er sie and es german doesnt have a genderless pronoun either
yes thats why they instead of both he and she works no one is excluded
i was commenting on the overly masculine nature of the english language in general i cannot comment on the particular technical documentbook you are referring to
very likely yes
i think that german has die der and das
the fact that the deputy leader of one of our main political parties is female and has the word man in her name is an endless source of amusement to the kind of person who thinks it witty to call her harriet harperson well it saves them having to engage with the issues such as the church of englands refusal to tolerate female bishops one columnist wrote in the daily mail what next perhaps as she plots her own takeover of the labour party leadership harman is even now planning legislation that at least one contender for the next archbishop of canterbury will have to wear a skirt no it just means not having to engage with harriet harman which is in many respects entirely understandable and i can also understand the jibe at language policing of this kind it reminds me a bit of the communists in russia abolishing the church marx said that reliquishing religion is supposed to happen as a natural consequence of liberating the proles not vice versa it is the same mistake here forcing some linguistic changes without changing any underlying power dynamics is pointless and just makes any movements for change that engage in such meddling seem humourless and trivial
apologies if this has already been mentioned but i havent read all the comments in modern academic philosophy it is near universal for she to be used when referring to a hypothetical agent eg if a person is committed to x being the case she must also hold y this may seem tokenistic in a discipline thats still dominated by men but i believe its generally wellmeant and ultimately preferable to the alternatives they sounds far too colloquial for published works and the use of one forces one to twist ones sentences in a rather convoluted manner as well as making one sound like ones a bit of a prick
one of my favourite books words and women is on this very topic the authors suggest the word co as the gender neutral pronoun there was some linguistic rationale behind it but i cant recall it now
kirstenbroomhall  october  am get ciffix for chrome i rather like the archaic fisherfolk as the generic
mx pronounced mix is starting to get a little traction as an alternative title for people who dont identify with either gender i think i now have three in my address book
yes but unless we are having dealings with amoeba slugs or suchlike i would like to know the gender of the romantic parties in the context of a novel
im not quite certain how you come to be an expert on english grammar i suppose you are an educated native speaker and thus presumably qualified to act as an informant to someone studying the language however i have to disagree with your characterization of singular and sexindefinite they as poor grammar you probably dont want to read ann bodines  paper entitied androcentrism in prescriptive grammar which makes an excellent scholarly case for the usage you find offensive personally id like to see the language revamped so man no longer refers to a male person but to any person we would then need a new word for a male person but im sure some youngster could come up with one that would spread over the internet one obvious advantage of this change is that words like fireman chairman and postman could be preserved another is that man is a nice compact word and it makes sense to me that the words for male person and female person should be longer than ones meaning simply person of course the disadvantages of the change include the fact that the lyrics of many popular songs im a man comes to mind would seem rather silly and would need to be glossed for the benefit of future generations presumably by professors of popular culture
should that not be each member of team a should look at themself in the mirror  
well the possibility of a love affair runs pretty much any way although the possibility of procreation without outside help exists only in some configurations
cos actress traditionally means prostitute or near enough
she or he or he or she
not really its particularly annoying when being used to discuss persons of status eg a hypothetical boss or a doctor as always he it shows a basic inability to expect that a women could be in this role i get a lot of otherwise very respectful emails to mr xxx im mrs or ms xxx and while its easy to make a slip and miss the fact that my first name is female it does irritate me that maleness has been assumed
i agree they is a fine plural but he or she does just as well when youre discussing a single person of unknown gender and she works fine in text
my germans not very good but i think so
in the book kindle edition which i otherwise greatly enjoyed it was singular they and there is much less clumsy than his or her i was wondering if that was a genuine subs slip or some subtle market research to see how many readers paid attention how many did so far
and in the case of harperson it references some of her barmier ideas in the name of gender war
could be rewritten as all members of team a etc and then the plural they is wholly appropriate
thank you as well for your very interesting replies youve certainly given me a lot to think about
lariaa saidlt sorry if this all sounds very pedantic or excessive gt absolutely not pedantic or excessive thank you for taking the time to formulate this at length if anything i was being pedantic about the grammatical angle just cause thats how i think these days due to massive amounts of study but of course what youre talking about here is part of daily reality for people outside of the grammar of their languages so to formulate more clearly what i think is the difference between the situation in english and that in the latin languages based on what youve written well i think what i was trying to say was that i personally havent encountered strategies to modify the language in french or portuguese spanish i know less whereas speakers of swedish and english have changed their pronouns they instead of him hen for a nonspecific subject pronoun i didnt want to suggest that people who speak spanish etc dont care
the subject pronoun is not obligatory however there is always a subject your listeners have figured out from the context who the subject of your sentence is and if it is a man then the grammatical gender of the subject is masculine and the adjective has to agree so the dropped subject of that sentence istú and the grammatical gender of tú depends solely on the biological sex of the person you are using it to refer to so in that respect when talking about people grammatical gender in latin languages is almost always directly related to biological sex and the male sex always takes precedence over the female to my mind my mother is my mother is my mother so when is she not my mother well in spanish when my dad is there as well and my mother becomes one of my fathers except i cant call her my father shes only one of my fathers when my dad is there too my father on the other hand is never ever my mother a bit like how the duchess of cambridge only has the right to be called your highness when her husband is there too and if hes not there she drops a rank or two and has to curtsey to camilla sorry if this all sounds very pedantic or excessive and i know there are plenty of arguments against what im saying as well as arguments for but if since the beginning of time women had ruled europe dominated all positions of power and commanded more respect than men then it would be unthinkable for the masculinemale to be the default and the femininefemale the exception or other in the language it would almost definitely be the other way around try imagining for a moment a language like that its funny so in that respect the gender systems of these languages are relics of deeply ingrained past sexism of course thats not to say that anyone using these languages now is sexist nor that they should be radically altered but i cant help but think that being reminded linguistically every time you open your mouth that males take precedence over females must have a bearing on peoples attitudes however slight or invisible and where this can be easily avoided it should be
jgrennison  october  pm  true and the culture novels would have been a golden opportunity for banks to invent one pity he didnt 
one example of clumsy he or she language that always gets me is men and women frequently used by politicians when talking about for example the brave men and women in the military dont we have a perfectly good single allinclusive word that includes human beings of both sexes in people why not use that
ohdamn
i think theres a reason actress has stuck where manageress and other esses have waned in use funny thing is the guardian frequently uses actor where reference is to a woman apparently some actresses prefer it
and keeping intact your view that you actually know how actually language actually is not something i claimed and a bit of an attack on the man rather than the ball but i see you were carpetbombing the whole thread with trolllike comments at the time ill leave it there
appreciate your amiable response beaton interesting what you say about the telegraph i wasnt aware i expect you and i would agree on most aspects of this matter
i take your point on clout i believe giles coren recently thought himself to possess the kind of clout that would permit him to preview his subedited copy after a hapless subeditor had expunged a definite article from the denouement of a column that compared the act of eating to a sexual activity writers like chomsky now control what they write his articles on the guardian are usually timelimited glen greenwald was also extended extraordinary privileges for all the good it did the guardian and its longterm cooperation with him and charlie brooker perhaps felt he wasnt being given a similar kind of rider id also agree that online publications such as the telegraph now appear to have abandoned subediting altogether and simply upload raw copy which perhaps wasnt the kind of liberty you were referring to
its not a matter of freedom its a matter of consistency when you write for a publication you write on behalf of a publication the publication can be sued for what you write am not convinced beaton i have seen modern writers use his instead of their for example gore vidal and christopher hitchens are two if i remember right and publishers usually defer in such cases ie cases in which the writer has clout when such a writer is printed he is not writing on behalf of a publication as on occasion is explicitly indicated the views here expressed are not necessarily the paper is printing him on behalf of its readers not all of us enjoy the same prominence as chomsky hitchens pilger vidal etc but i see no patently defensible reason for not extending the same liberty to everyone as for your reference to litigation this surely is irrelevant in the present context and where consistency is concerned papers that allow all sorts of septic grammar including grammar proscribed by their own style guide can hardly be regarded as its champions in the meantime i am myself one of those who admire the guardian for its tolerance and for its willingness to let the other guy speak
there is no reason why something similar should not happen to they singular they is much less clumsy than he or she and does not consign half the human race to subservience by calling women he i am responding to the above and some comments i have seen that dont like the singular use of the word they i havent read the entire discussion below the piece no please feel free to point out exactly what you feel i have failed to understand
sexist habits persist in using woman as an adjective in such phrases as woman bishop and women mps with their pejorative echo of women drivers earlier in the text  policemen and woman police constables have become police officers shows you how pervasive a habit is when an article which points out a sexist habit uses it in the same article
pm the head clears up a little overnight david marsh sorry to have used the adjective ugly stronger than i intended and if i hadnt written so impetuously i would have seen that your argument can be viewed as that of a man who would like to see certain conventions adopted rather than others outlawed nothing wrong with such a stance compare  i dont agree with him taking this action and  i dont agree with his taking this action the construction exemplified in the second case was passionately endorsed as you know by fowler and its full adoption would mean the elimination not only of certain ambiguities but also of a vast set of locutions that are without grammatical basis sentences of type  are all over the pages of newspapers on this side of the atlantic fowlers conviction that  should be the model adhered to was not quite the same as a desire to repress those who would write 
marsh and others entirely miss the point of harperson which is to debase the person through their most individual attribute their name vernacular speech routinely debases politicians this way whether it is dave for the current pm mccavity brown for the last one or mcshameless for the disgraced exmp denis macshane the vernacular internet abounds with abusive appellations like these these are simply parodies of persons and their use reveals nothing about the writers intelligence
sounds like shit
master doesnt technically have roots in gender quite the opposite it acquired gender connotations due to sexism she is silly likewise for herstory
kuzbot its the same in my native welslh ystoria is history but the his in history in english reflects too accurately on how history was and still is told from the male point of view the lives of women are not seen not because they are doing nothing except domestic work and childcare either before the industrial revolution women partnered men on farms in crafts and in trade in ruling war and in arts and sciences surprisingly often in religion women played active parts yet history writes as if men are the only players on the stage worse there are numerous cases where female achievement is ascribed to a male especially after the female dies it was once said there were no great women artists for example as gentileschis paintings were credited to michelangelo aphra behn was not and still is rarely taught in literature or ththc english politics the beguines and their successful female communities were buried and forgopttenonly a few random examples check out the dinner party by judy chicago or erasure by dale spenderfeminist scholarship has been pegging away uncovering lost worlds of herstory since the s also in the thc ref matilda joslyn gagesome of this lost information has now become better known im sure most readers will have heard of the names i gave above by now but a lot remains to be doneherstory as a concept helps a lot because it reminds us history is an iceberg of course the hidden parts also mean black history lower class history gay history too one thing i love about herstory is how it suddenly switches a whole period to look different the socalled dark ages for example said to be poorly educated times were a good period for educated women in large monasteries they ran as abbesses supervising both nuns and monks in mixed houses
most sexist and racist language arises from the presumption that everyone is male and white if you can just remember that this is not in fact the case its easy to avoid anyone can do it if they try and the award for the guardians most patronising and selfrighteous sermon of  goes tothe rev david marsh
iain banks makes a point of stating in one of the culture novels that marain doesnt have gendered pronouns at all the hesheit distinction is one intrinsic to the english the book is written in rather than the culture itselffrankly itd make life much easier if english had such a pronoun which referred to any sufficiently sentient entity

yikes thats a bit harsh david i reckon you i say you because im talking about you david not you the whole of humanity here i should stress should most likely saya if on the whole you thought this person was maleb if on the whole you thought this person was femalec if you were having a bit of a joke with a mated if you werent sure how many people it was that were getting off the bus good luck with that campaign against the prescriptivists and keeping intact your view that you actually know how actually language actually is power to the persons

kizbot  october  pm  the only thing i still stub my mental toe on with german is that the word for young woman maedchen is neuter gender not so bad in itself but then subsequently you have to use the neuter pronoun eg das maedchen klopfte an die tuer danach ging es wieder weg literal the girl knocked at the door after that went it again away i can never get used to calling a woman it it makes my skin crawl

no he wasnt he was making a point about usage  i disagree he used certain carefully selected es to bolster his argument while ignoring other sexist uses of he and man by the same authors as a general criticism of the article such assertions as this and does not consign half the human race to subservience by calling women he do nothing to help his cause and sound rather hysterical the use of he as a general pronoun can be understood as a neutral denominator by the skilled reader and most certainly does not consign anyone to subservience one must read with subtlety and finesse thats all and that means treating he as a neutral term when it is clearly the authors intent ive been doing this for years so i dont really understand why david marsh is taking it so literally as i said in an earlier post the automatism that compels women to wear makeup and look pretty in public life is a far greater sign of a sexist society than the humble use of he
notproperty said lt in a society which uses a strongly gendered language your objection to referring to groups of mostly female humans in the linguistic masculine could itself be interpreted as sexist gt or depending on the language it could be utterly incomprehensible a lot of languages in the nigercongo family in africa have huge gender systems with up to  genders the genders are in categories like the following from the manjaku language which evidently has male human female human animal plant object body part multiplied by two for singular plural but there are exceptions to the pattern tools are sometimes plants or animals smoke is an animal fire is a plant night is a plant day is an animal a child in the singular belongs to the masculine gender like all male humans but children in the plural belong to the pluralanimals gender a friend a human being who you refer to as your friend takes the plantgender the question is are people who speak manjuku predisposed to pour a nice big bucket of water over a visiting friend because of the gender system of their language or can folks see through the gender system and correctly identify their friends as human beings and give them a cup of coffee instead
lariaa wrote lt if it were completely true then why would a man correct me when i say estás cansada there is no subject in that sentence so from a purely grammatical point of view it is not incorrect but it is incorrect from the point of view of biological sex if it were not related to biological sex then why can i not refer to my sister as my hermano even though i supposedly have two hermanos one hermano and one hermana gt spanish is a prodrop language the subject pronoun is not obligatory however there is always a subject your listeners have figured out from the context who the subject of your sentence is and if it is a man then the grammatical gender of the subject is masculine and the adjective has to agree this is not sexism or any form of gender stereotyping it is syntax the native speaker who corrects you does so from a purely grammatical point of view as you say because there is an elementary grammatical error in the sentence the speaker may also harbour sexist notions of course but a female native speaker who happens to be sitting there listening will inevitably also hear the mistake and you dont call your sister hermano for precisely the same reason that i guess you dont call her brother when speaking english hermano in the singular doesnt mean sister
thanks appreciated 
errrrr  october  pm get ciffix for chrome and so as not to be offtopic im totally with the singular they
what am i doing no wonder fewer than one in three labour mps are female this construction annoys me fewer than one okay thats zero then so zero in three labour mps none of them not even de piero less than a third less than  but not fewer than one in three
thanks for the long and informative reply
you can get david crystals review here
youre not boring me ive enjoyed the exchange thanks and i can bore the hind legs off a donkey quite happily 
great comment thanks sylvester im in complete agreement about the comfort of having rules i see from your language log link that the singular they also came up as a topic covered in geoff pullums review of the book pity that the link to david crystals parallel review no longer works
yes you have a point and i wont go any further dont want to be more of a bore than i can help good night and to beaton
why do we need miss mrs and mr nowadays why not just use firstname surname on a related note i notice that in america the term esquire is used by both male and female lawyers
no he wasnt he was making a point about usage the use of they etc doesnt make life more difficult for translators at all the point of translating anything is to reflect the way a language is used so however its used then translators have to show that language is not purged it simply changes to reflect the world we wish to express language is not meddled with its just used and language is usage you may not like or approve of new ways of using it but the language will go its own merry way regardless
the rulesshe and he combined into she pronounced she she drove the carher and him combined into hir pronounced her give hir the carher and his combined unto hir pronounced her it is hir car simples
i tend to use sheheit and say it quickly
no i think its not the only factor though it is one of them for some i think it is the comfort that comes from having rules they learn those rules and feel that they speak correctly or more usually write correctly as you implied in speech pedants break their own rules if they are too unnatural to keep to they then feel that they know what is right and others dont classifying english grammar with the same terms as we use for latin grammar for so many years doesnt help either simon heffer allow me to enlighten you
i believe he was implicitly by sandwiching the es between two references to sexist language ultimately a crusade on behalf of the singular their will not cure us of sexism it will just make work more difficult for translatorsand will we then have to purge mankind mannequin manmade man on the street everyman etc from our vocabulary therein lies the problem once these meddlers get going on the language theyll not know when to stop
no idea who that is but if hes a tory buffoon then hell probably fit the bill of course the middle classes and above have traditionally aspired to speak some form of rp and thats commonly involved following rules that have often been invented take the whole and i or and me movements over the years for instance this was a case of telling people how they should speak in order to be in the club anyone not adhering to these rules was uncouth and if we translate that honestly working class the working classes of course have never been allowed in the club and their nonadherence to prescriptivist bourgeois language trends has helped to keep them outside all aspects of middle class life i wonder therefore if the lack of acceptance that many people commenting here seem to have of the singular they might fall within the same category that it sounds to them too much to be the language of the hoi polloi and that somehow more educated people would rather find alternative ways to express the same meaning i have no research to support that might i add and i doubt it would be the only factor but you never know it might be playing on some peoples minds prescriptivists tend to like to have a set of fabricated language rules to follow that it seems to me in their understanding only educated people like themselves have access to and the brain capacity to utilise correctly its the same argument as when you have rules for social etiquette they exist so that those with the same levels of decency in their upbringing can recognise each other and more importantly for them know which people to avoid
as a speaker of greek coz i live in greece i dont see the word history as in any way gendered its istoria totally greek and if its gendered at all then its feminine like the original greek word
indeed the issue does exist and id recommend reading up on it to other commentators on this thread whatever their other linguistic interests may be or should that their be his or her
if everybody minded their own business said the duchess in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does i thought that their was there because it was a plural surely everybody is more than one person i realise shes talking about alice but it still sounds like a plural
house styles are different in every company its quite a lot of work for writers because they have to familiarise themselves with each house style such is the lot of writers but that is not prescriptive of rules for the population at large
mine wasnt so snappy as the original but yours rocks
yes it is well established ive been using it for clarity since i was eleven but there is an issue with the ideology of lang use the issue exists linguistically
i dont mind what choices others make but feel free to express my opinions on them
would you refuse to address a woman in the way she asks to be addressed nothing wrong with madam in itself but it would be flat out rude to not refer to a woman as ms if that is what she herself prefers
the idea of gender in language is not wrong its simply the way the grammar of some languages work the way a language works is the way it works its the usage that has developed in any particular lang how can that be wrong
so hse would be he or she
he wasnt attributing pc thinking to shakey he was simply showing the usage of they etc as a generic it has a long history and is not a new pc usage
and prescriptivists often break their own rules use said rules to make themselves feel that theyre better than other people or to put down the working classes in some cases you must be thinking of those pedants without a linguistic qualification such as arch tory buffoon simon heffer rhymes with bullsomething who like to protest yet have not a clue what they are talking about
could you not point them in the right direction with the phrase follow your nose
this thread has turned rather into a comment on feminism rather than linguistics the original point being made by david marsh is that the use of they to mean he or she when we dont know or dont care to distinguish the gender of the pronoun is wellestablished and that pedants without a linguistic qualification such as arch tory buffoon simon heffer rhymes with bullsomething who like to protest have not a clue what they are talking about
well if youre going to be pedantic it should be she pees and then those are little white fluffy things in a field so they are lambies and lambies sounds like the plural of the labour mp for tottenham and so on so you see we can all be as witlessly irrelevant as you if we want to be
everyone has their own way of speaking a language this is yours but what feels wrong to you may not feel wrong to someone else change happens slowly over the life of a language that is why we describe them as living
with equal respect i dont i use they when referring to an individual of indefinite sex and thought it common usage that was entirely my point
i hate it
sheesh
but since linguistic gender and biological sex are not the same thing your claim of humiliation could be taken as ignorant i find it entirely conceivable that in a society in which biological sex is considered relatively unimportant but which uses a strongly gendered language your objection to referring to groups of mostly female humans in the linguistic masculine could itself be interpreted as sexist this might be true if such a society existed but since the languages were talking about here english and latin languages come from cultures with millenialong histories of deeply ingrained sexism i dont think your argument holds water i have had spanish people try and tell me that biological sex and grammatical gender are not the same thing and i suppose you can argue that in the case of objects a table clearly has no sex but if it were completely true then why would a man correct me when i say estás cansada there is no subject in that sentence so from a purely grammatical point of view it is not incorrect but it is incorrect from the point of view of biological sex if it were not related to biological sex then why can i not refer to my sister as my hermano even though i supposedly have two hermanos one hermano and one hermana if it were not sexist then why is it always the words used to refer to men that are used as the standard the default even say in french when talking about the feminine les victimes the next sentence will then revert back to the masculine as soon as possible and many speakers of latin languages are aware of this and make efforts to avoid unnecessary sexism where possible completely eradicating it from latin languages though would be impossible due to their structure also i am aware that a relic of past sexism is not always a sign or a cause of present sexism but in english it is perfectly possible and simple and so we should
its the fourth of six points he makes towards the end of the essay saying iv never use the passive where you can use the active id like to know from elmerfudd  what is the average rate of usage of the passive voice specifically the average rate in an essay about the use of english  how far orwell exceeds it in his essay as an absolute count  in how many of those instances he could have used the active voice  if he agrees that saying orwell denounced the passive voice as a means for obscuring agency is dishonest

its not a matter of freedom its a matter of consistency when you write for a publication you write on behalf of a publication the publication will be judged on the quality of what you write the publication can be sued for what you write so it seems to make sense to adhere to a house style and try to achieve some form of orthographic grammatical and lexical consistency oxford has its conventions cambridge has its conventions whereas i agree that lexical consistency can sometimes carry some political baggage whether to describe people as terroristsguerillasfreedomfightersinsurgents etc i cant really see the profound politics in the oxford comma many people mistakingly view serial commas or oxford spelling as newfangled americanisms when in fact they probably preceded the conventions prevalent in most of british publishing maybe choosing not to use oxford spelling or punctuation might be a wrongheaded swipe at americanisation or americanization if you prefer perhaps choosing to use the generic he is a swipe at feminism just as changing the word chairman to chairperson was a swipe at patriarchy however it all seems extremely petty and smallminded when compared to deciding what to call the occupied territories
im not sure i could womanage all these neologisms without also womangling my syntax though rather then go through a lot of needless womanual labor i might defer to someone with an advanced degree mistresses or masters from ewomannuel college or some other respected institution
yes youre right i was teasing david marsh for his attempt to retroactively attribute pc thinking to shakespeare some people cant accept that artists of the past didnt think in such categories and some of them were decidedly nonpc i was reading some charming old tales to my kids the other night and suddenly i found myself having to censor out the n word the book was otherwise great but back then it was an acceptable term
she is spoken as she or he which slides quite easily
i was a keen participant in the language changes arising out of the s womens movement and i still like the elegance and accuracy i do get fed up with people still using that ancient mistake man instead of humanity this was based on mediaeval christian monks who bowdlerised their latin translations of the bible and classics in latin homo human vir man very clear distinction these naughty monks translated both as man man to reflect their idea that only males had souls so only male humans are persons not something we want to support nowit has been explained countless times since the s after all we dont say stone age man used mosses for his menstrual needs do we some more delights she is an alternative to they as an inclusive pronoun dear madam sir makes sense to me because if im writing im female so i put my own category first i find it natural for a man to write dear sir madam but peculiar for women to give privilege to men i prefer to mistress a subject not master it i keep a mistress copy of a file to take copies from i have a mistress or main bedroomi am even happy to be mistressfulbut again a man might well be happy using male language i find it odd i study a masters degree this needs changing it reflects the bad history when women until the thc were not permitted to achieve academic degrees ba bachelor is also inaccurate herstory is a lovely neologism now well established it is a genuinely different perspective with its own insights either a female point of view in history or the individual story of experiential history actor nurse etc fine glad to see most of the demeaning ette words gowitch still means a woman and her partner or apprentice can be a male witch interesting that christianity clings to woman priest but then a priestess holds authority in her own right not because men gave it to her and not because she does her work as a copy of a man
shakespeares pc use of they i take your point but its really not pc at all its just english its the english use of they nothing more nothing less its perfectly normal natural grammatically correct english and has been so for at least half a millennium though i expect it could be traced back even further if anybody looked hard enough the fact that some people inexplicably get their undergarments in a twist about a basic obvious feature of english grammar really is neither here nor there it just makes them look foolish thats all by the way i agree with your opinion that language is not the right battlefield for gender equality language reflects inequality that exists in society just like it reflects every other aspect of reality whether good bad or neutral language itself doesnt create inequality you would have to be a hardcore proponent of some extreme version of the sapirwhorf hypothesis to imagine that

sexism this piece is a bit rich after gabys rant the other week httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejancologneattackshardquestionsnewyearseve
women have plenty of power also in every sense they have the same opportunities as men one of the main things holding them back is feminism conditioning them to be overlysensitive and to reject all that is natural to themyou need to drop this marxist notion of seeing everything in terms of oppression society is a collaborative thing as our environment changes so do the roles deemed available to each sex
as a novelist i choose the most appropriate words some do not have positive connotations prostitute pimp but they reflect the reality of the world i write about you dont like these words dont use them yourself this is a storm in a teacup
anthropology in common with many degrees does not inculcate an academic from being a pompous blinkered opinionated cock his comment is not made true by his specialism

no the meaning of english words is decided by a shadowy group of men that meet once a year with the express intention of keeping down women dammit did i miss this years meeting as well 
i hope so i couldnt give a if someone is married or not and i think its about time we stopped yelling unmarried manwoman at people its simply not relevant
good grief the lazy dismissals are out early today why didnt you just ask all the men to pop the kettle on love the women are talkingif theres defensiveness its more in that kneejerk reaction of yours
yeah thinking bad
english has lost most of its grammatical gender though not entirely as part of a general trend in its evolution from the highly inflected west germanic dialect to modern english however this evolution has been uneven and in particular words that were adopted from foreign languages in particular words that flowed from latin via norman french often still retain the romance grammatical gender feminineinflected words many of which come via norman french still use the ess ending it isnt an example of sexism but more simply the nature of how the grammar rules surrounding loanwords can defy the rules of sound change in native words in this case words that come to modern english from the anglosaxon dialect of west germanic its a fascinating area of linguistics but one more properly dealt with by a proper column and not by someone just mindlessly racing through the latest oxford dictionary looking for examples of how much englishspeaking people allegedly hate women
you know that thing i think happens the one without any evidence of it being a rule if it doesnt happen it sure happens
the words prostitute and mistress should be banned immediately since there is no male gender reference for the equally shared situations ok gigolo toy boy spring to mind immmediately ponce for aman who lives off the earnings of a prostitute
your perspective is childishly simple you have the power so as you say you dont care you just enjoy having the power backing you up to be able to dismiss others and tell them that their perception is wrong
equality means you can call tories scum or the royal family parasites even on these very pages because thats just fair comment but if i use exactly the same terms to describe radical islamists or illegal imigrants that would be hate speech and lead to a call to the constabulary or perhaps just an orchestrated visit from rentamob next time i want to speak equality leftwing style with its entrenched biases wildly inconsistent rules depending on the group to which a person is deemed to belong and evident desperation to control peoples thoughts by controlling their language using the criminal law if necessary for fear of losing the public debate if others are actually free to say what they wish is truly a wonder to behold

life is as tedious as a twicetold tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man sic this is a tale worth telling and retelling patriarchal values so permeate our society that they are seldom considered newsworthy yet male dominance has tragic consequences every day name calling often leads to sticks and stones i didnt know the etymology of tart im surprised the article didnt mention the contrast between public man and public woman the fact that one can use a pejorative term to describe a man obviously has no bearing upon the issue
no problem a little perspective might do you good
conbected eh now theres a word for you all
people need to justifyrationalize their bad behaviorsthoughts toward others what better way than to denigrate the person in your mind who you are denigrating or want to denigratei want to use you for sex or i am using you for sex hence you have some sexual power over me therefore you must deserve it you must be an immoral slut
the piece appears to making a point rather than have an agenda a point that i for one found interesting because i happen to like articles about language and how the meanings of words can change over time the point was simply this that many of the words conbected with females or female activities have tended to acquire derogatory connotations over the centuries i think that is not only interesting but just perhaps instructive also perhaps that is the agenda you serm to dislike so much
there is already such a thing for the macquarie dictionary currently taking votes for word of the year httpswwwmacquariedictionarycomau
and you just hear women so often being referred to as wenches i think the last time i heard that was in a blackadder the third episode
denigrate is a verb that means to to disparage or belittle it doesnt call for it to happen any more than genocide actually calls for identifiable ethnic groups to killed
some of these words are barely in use today wench has probably already tipped over into the moribund category and if this is to be an appropriate sampling then how about all the other words that have had altered definitions the indoeuropean language has many cognates that have had altered meanings over time some cognates even flipping definitions the protoindoeuropean word for shine or burn has been transformed into black in the germanic languages usually meaning burned whereas in slavic and baltic languages the cognate actually means white
paranoidreinforcingyep its all womens fault youre totally correct thanks for the enlightening input
is that one of those words i dont want my browsing history showing i looked up
actors are always actors male of female within the profession youre decades out of date old boy
let us walk slowly but steadily there are words of female denigration that could be eliminated quickly and without too much fuss the words prostitute and mistress should be banned immediately since there is no male gender reference for the equally shared situationsi suggest an australian committee be set up under the auspices of one of our illustrious universities to look into and deliberate on the use of words in our languagei understand that there is a committee in britain that meets once a year to deliberate on changes and additions to the english dictionary
how many unmarried women reading this can say they have ever been referred to as such well when i was unmarried but getting married that was the official description of me on the paperwork perhaps thats not the case now

phew good thing then that other languages are far more progressive the fact that all sciences are female in german has led to women domineering the field from quantum mechanics to space exploration in germany austria and switzerland oh waitcheap reduction of the actual point
dont worry im a feminist and i use the word all the fucking time
its so refreshing to see the guardian finally tackling sexism theyve ignored it for way too long
but thats exactly my point as you have so clearly pointed out these words are all gender neutral but the oxford has specifically used male pronouns its being sexist towards men women can also be drunken abusive aggressive convicts as well im not going to post the myriad of maleonly pejorative terms for fear of incurring the wrath of the moderators
no im not bothered because i dont adhere to a paranoid ideologyare you not reinforcing that structural prejudice against female type power by dismissing it in favour of chasing after typically male poweryou should reflect on this a little
how very dare you make assumptions about my gender ill have you know some of my best friends are lgb amp t
oh shut up about that for gods sakes female actors have chosen to be called that for bloody decades
its a rubbish article that betrays the writers incredible ignorance of how idiom and meaning changes in language over time and that the definition of words is not static so you know more than the anthropologist then
strumpet is a great word it sounds wonderful it would almost be worth being one so i could be called itmind you im a useless spinet player does that count maybe i am one after all
you have missed the point of course there are words which one might try to avoid using in certain contexts but banning words making words illegal or controversial is where i draw the line you should be allowed to use the words you want to use where ever and however you want to use them of course if you tell me im a tosser id probably think this guy sounds angry or has issues or is unable to be pragmatic or brainwashed by the press or had a limited vocab etc etc and i probably wouldnt like it but i still support your right to use those words even if it limits you socially or in other ways its your choice thats the point i dont swear that much but if people want to thats ok words are just words i dont know how old you are but in my day we didnt attach as much importance to words as people do now and now what you say and how you say it is important but only because words have become so important re what other people think about you because of something someone else might say is an interesting way of psychoanalising different male attutudes i assume you are maletake for example a man walking down the street and someone calls him a tosser to his face now one type of male would react to that another type of male would ignore it or run away or walk on without even noticing for the male who reacts to it his sense of ego is hurt his sense of self he is a tosser in his own head until he has got revenge and detossified himself if you will by calling the other bloke a tosser back for him language and what other people say about him is important for the bloke who doesnt react its not important what others say to him is of no consequence he is above it however words take on a new dimension when you define certain crimes in an emotive way calling someone a racist for example is only offensive because of the social hysteria that crime engenders if there was no hysteria it wouldnt matter
speaking of collocation the word secretary is very close to sexand moved from being a job once too important for a woman to do to being one expected of a woman figure it out when something becomes easy the job becomes cheap and gets shifted from men to women that still happens you know if not here nearly everywhere else in the world
save maladroit which is masculine something you have in common
exactly youre not bothered because language does not serve to demean you yet at the same time instead of being prepared to think about how language is used to demean females and what the social power imbalances involved in this are you just want to play a game of trying to dispute it and actually ridiculously suggesting women are really the ones being sexist as for nurturing yes it should be an act of power yet society is not structured to accord it recognition as such
peas minted is a new one to me
you didnt really get it did you the point of the article is that a societys attitudes towards the issues that really matter are reflected in its language
right provide some evidence that feminists are ignoring rd world rape evidence does not incidentally consist of complaining that feminists wrote about something else please tell us what you yourself are doing to stop rape in other countries since it concerns you so much
it milks it because it correlates with and feeds the grauns own prejudices this isnt about the interests of the readership as a whole as theyre very selective on that front
dummheit is also feminine that explains it
interesting overview but i think its fair to say that many of these words have well and truly fallen out of common usage and when they are used it is often ironically i often call my wife a hussy which is not meant to be perjorative and is not received that way but actually turns out to be the correct application of the word im sure she will have a laugh at that
bob think you have misunderstood many things have looked from only one perspective give it another go you might get it hopefully x
crikey you could have a field day with spanish german and frenchenglish is somewhat restrained in respect of sexism as compared to the balance of eu languages
i hear it used and use it in a nice way about pets who are a bit manically friendly 
good grief the defensive men are out in force today
not a coincidence at all latin dexter means right sinister means left roman legions often had sinistercii left handed legionaries posted on the right flank and valued highly for their courage and steadiness in battle however a civilian sinistercio could grasp your right hand with his and still be able to stab you with his left ergo sinister sneaky threatening et ceteraon the other hand no pun intended khakhanded has always been an insult
sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me one of the worst myths of childhood incredibly harmful if believed
obviously not been on the receiving end of abuse i have
it doesnt explore anything its a rubbish article that betrays the writers incredible ignorance of how idiom and meaning changes in language over time and that the definition of words is not static its an absurd article and a waste of the guardians editorial resources whats next week going through a telephone directory to find misogynistic surnames
did knowing they were a fuckwit impact on your learning
seconded
phew good thing then that other languages are far more progressive the fact that all sciences are female in german has led to women domineering the field from quantum mechanics to space exploration in germany austria and switzerland oh wait
ive had plenty of men telling what to do when they had no business to i do feel that bossy is usually applied to women but im happy to apply it to men as well ok
no it doesnt
it is sometimes the case that a woman is described as bossy when a man sayingdoing exactly the same thing would be described as assertive
ill stick to what my mum always told me sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me about time people grew up and stopped nit picking stupid crap and addressed the issues that really matter ie equal pay for equal work equal opportunity female sex slavery female genital mutilation etc this sort of article and the research required to put pen to paper is a waste of time
both words stem from the latin root word for black in the case of denigrate it evolved from to blackentarnishdefame but denigrate was used in the early th century far before the slur was used the midtolate th century it is not a reference to negro but a reference to the latinnorman root for the word black in fact when the slur became popular the word denigrate nearly dropped out of use entirely that said if denigrate consistently calls forth oppression in the minds of speakers and listeners especially those most vulnerable to it then another word should be used in my experience that isnt the case
dastardly devils we must round them up and chastise them
generally yes but there are cultures and times when between mates such words are used in fun
why because no woman ever achieved the status of governess in the sense of governor how do you know that

philanderer a combination of two greek words philos friend and andras man meaning somebody who befriends or loves men which has come to mean exactly the opposite in current usage a philanderer is not somebody chasing women but men which would make the said philanderer either a woman or a homosexual philogynist would be the right form cf misogynistin the correct sense the word appears in the greek text of the new testament where the apostle paul encourages women to be filandroi that is love their husbands
good grief the guardians scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one
and aardvark
i was using hyperbole to highlight the paranoid thinking of many feministsyou have to also remember that behaviour is formative of cultural norms or are you someone who thinks its all a social construct
and until the married womens property act if you married any otherwise unsecured ie unsecured by legal settlements property or money went straight to your husband and you completely lost control of it also a man could divorce his wife for one act of adultery but a woman could only do that if she could prove she had suffered violence from her husband as well even if her husband screwed every woman in sight and the cat as well domestic violence is not easy to prove even now when i married i seem to recall being described as spinster on the forms i also seem to recall thinking at the time it was an irritating description
quite possibly and quite possibly there were and are women who have to shoulder the debts of their husbands
not happy about that change of meaning
im well aware it was rhetoric my point was that i doubt the op takes it seriously his understanding his shallow none of his definitions would be news to anyone probably because hes biased he really should do some more reading
im not at all bothered by what you might call sexist language against menhave you done a thorough analysis of the english language or are you just cherrypicking words that suit your hypothesisi think you might be guilty of sexism yourself in defining power in terms of male activity is nurturing or caring not also an act of power
but as i said only the casting people need to discriminate unless youre in casting you could just stick to the word actor and leave it at that
i think were both broadly in agreement historically there is a shift in how a significant minority feel think and act there is then a learning phase where remissive but previously tolerated behaviour is frowned upon then stigmatized then made illegal this is clearly well and good i think hackles rise where either a it is claimed the historical record must be expunged which seemed to be her position as she didnt get the right dictionary or b where special pleading is being used thus and i think this seemed to be her position by magicking away the possibility of suggesting that there could be extremist feminism you thereby removed prejudice deauthorized any point of view that disagreed with your own and somehow your were empowered to insist that everyone agree with you otherwise as was suggested to me a couple of times the one disagreeing must hate women or secretly hate women id point you to a couple of examples but all the discussion has been delisted i think this is a particular danger for any strongly ideologized system of thought that any disagreement must be motivated by undisclosed hatred alliance with the devilthe patriarchystalin and it takes a lot of care to produce social critique which can also stand being critiqued itself as for the odo rather than the oed it was a rather unfortunate choice ive no idea how they choose their examples my guess is taking the least bizarre from the historical examples perhaps run against a linguistic corpus i wish there were proper thoughtful feminists writing for the graun i really do and it fills me with rage that on perhaps the last liberal english language newspaper what we get is an undergraduatelevel slipshod factsreallydontmatter blancmange its not right i tell you its not right rabid thats me
on the other hand where do words and phrases intended just for men come from ie wanker creepy old man twat creep dick perv wet puny drip and sissy some of which i have heard women call men that they have never even met before
you either didnt read the article or make the inference over time it drastically narrowed in scope and fell in status no it didnt it has approximately the same scope and status as it previously did
exactly how would the production accountant know who to pay less
you do know that the opposite of progressive is conservative right now remind me which partys candidates fight over whos the real conservative
lord have mercy actually lots of words go from good and respectable to low status or insulting over the centuries the english language is always changing examples cretin used to mean christianordinary man but once it started to be applied compassionately to mentally handicapped people it became a scornful term for an idiot idiot used to mean an unskilled layman as opposed to a skilled worker butler used to be an officer of the kings household in charge of wine now a servant janitor used to be the man who kept watch at the door now a cleaner villein used to mean a free peasantcommon man became villain these are just a few off the top of my head im sure there are plenty more the only thing mr shariatmadaris examples prove is that if you go looking for proof of something youve already decided is true youll find it i am very glad to be a woman in an englishheritage and englishlanguage society not only is it probably the least sexist society that exists it has a long history of humane social development and legal rights for the common person
if you google bottom youll quickly get of the barrel apparently some people scrape it
actress has only been replaced by actor on the guardian it is kind of silly too since if there is one place where gender difference is important its acting jesus we always get this outdated and ignorant whine female actors have been known within the business as actors at their request if not insistence since well before my time in the theatre as a technician and that was in the s male and female actors have been playing their opposite sexes since shakespeare and as far back as the greek dramas come to that youre a bit behind the times all round
what like tosser or tool or prick or pansy or jerk etc etc you mean
thats the sole aim of these men
thats really what you think feminists are saying isnt it is there no way to clarify for you is there no way for you to understand how cultural norms are formative of behaviour do you really not understand that power is both overt and covert both positive and negative
eight words dont prove anything unless youre desperate and dishonest enough to make them prove anything you want to prove
i myself also remember thinking that frank was completely mad although that was more to do with the fact he voluntarily agreed to step into the ring with iron mike tyson i guess it is a case of everything in context often how something is said by who and to whom if the author wanted a true idea of how these phrases can be used in a derogatory sense they should play any war video game online
the problem with what can be loosely called pcness is the growth in the use of euphemisms so far as i can see this is a disease of the entire englishspeaking world people no longer say what they mean in fact in many cases i am convinced they no longer know what they mean this makes constructive and intelligent conversation virtually impossible just when things begin to get interesting there is an embarrassed silence and the poor perpetrator blushes and apologises for the gaffe or even worse digs even more furiously by attempting to laugh it off the concept of poor taste was a much more subtle way of dealing with such things but now i doubt if many understand what it means language is our main means of communication how we say something lets out much more about us than what we say the effect of pcness therefore is to make us more dishonest about ourselves and arguably more dishonest with ourselves
there is another sinister side to this the most effective way to exclude someone from debate is to label them a nutter or mental even so called lovers of free speech do this despite our intelligence we are effectively silenced after all who is going to listen to the opinions of a nutter
sorry i was making a possibly illtimed play on words on the phrase its politcal correctness gone mad
i understand and i realise ive gone a little off topic by bringing in assisted dying for terminal illnesses however i believe that often suicide is framed as what is good for society rather than for the individual you say success is when those people are alive today with jobs families and futures having a job benefits the state working for zero hours in a crushing dead end job benefits the company you are working for it is very difficult to find work that benefits the individual believe me families again not a prerequisite for individual happiness but something that the state absolutely requires of us who else is going to look after our greying population and futures well without a fulfilling job or the want for a family the future can look pretty bleak i dont think it should be anyones jobs to tell people what they can do with their lives including ending it
i dont think that policing freespeech is ever a good idea rather than saying what others can or cant do we should do what we feel is right honestly how often can we rely on governmentnewspapersorganizations to actually help us out as someone who has bipolar disorder i know that moping about and complaining about the world isnt going to make the world warm up to you we have to change the world ourselves and promote action changing other people doesnt work so standing up for people with mental health issues and expressing your disgust and why you feel a certain way is a lot more progressive than banning language i know social responsibility isnt a very popular idea at least in the states where i live because people often feel powerless but its the reality of our world to be platitudinous you cant expect something to just happen you have to work for it
logically yes but i was being tongue in cheek i think there is a difference between certain kinds of human behaviour that could be described as crazy mad or bonkers and the very real suffering of somebody with mental illness for which these words are inappropriate i agree that a lot of people dont understand the distinction but i dont see that as a reason for us to be deprived of a colourful and descriptive part of the english language trying to censor the language wholesale is not going to destroy the prejudice although pointing out when it is used inappropriately as in the case of the suns headline might help
one such consideration is the wider impact on society and the harm that is caused to real peoples lives by using outdated language to reinforce outdated notions such as sin and crime as i suggested ive never met anyone who uses the term commit suicide in relation to outdated notions such as sin and crime as opposed to simply being a descriptive term for killing oneself indeed replacing it with the term killing oneself or died by suicide an utterly innaccurate use of the passive tense btw would do nothing to remove the stigma involved for those who stigmatise rather than the vast majority who have nothing but sympathy for those involved since that stigma is derived from the act involved not the language ised to describe it use whatever term you like and the act of suicide will still be seen as an undesireable desperate act do you propose to go through the whole of the english language and purge any terms which have negative historical connotations even when those connotations are rarely if ever recognised by modern users that is the epitome of pointless self defeating political correctness it is seeking out offence when no offence is intended and it simply alienates those who have no intention of giving offence suicide is a deeply serious issue not one for semantics and point scoring please consider that when adding comments i find that deeply offensive and am very tempted to tell you exactly where to get off in stronger language than thatas someone who will lose a large chunk of my life as the result of a suicide attempt i dont need you to superciliously point out that suicide is a serious issue thank you i suspect i have more first hand experience of precisely how serious it is than you do the assumption that someone is not taking the issue seriously simply because they disagree with you on this is about as ignorant and arrogant as it gets and pretty much sums up all that is worst about cif it is not me who is complaining about the semantic terms used to describe suicide and i am not trying to score points i am responding to the authors points in relation to semantics and if you want to get obnoxiously supercilious about that i would strongly suggest you address your remark please consider that when adding comments to her and those who brought up the issue but of course you support their arguments so you wont do that
as ever with offensive words its a moot point something you can debate with a cool head until one of them directly affects you i hate it when supposedlyeducated friends use words like flid and spastic as well as retard this is because of the pain caused to my family by idiots who still shout insults at the disabled members of my family ultimately if youre aware that people are offended by certain words try not to use them it wont kill you it wont cost you and youll be making the word a better place
i dont think theres anything at all wrong with referring to choices or actions as insane presuming you believe that those choices or actions run counter to sanity irrational is just as good a word for it though really the word insane ought to be perfectly fine for use in reference to people too in certain situations such as a fullon psychotic episode during a psychotic episode you are indeed insane frank had a bout of insanity a few years back might be perfectly acceptable if it werent for the fact that insane now has so much negativity to it as opposed to being a clinical term hell even insane asylum is fine if you look at the actual meanings a refuge for people who are are acting irrationally whats wrong with that the actual places were sadly rather shit though
given that the very definition of a disability is a condition which has a negative impact on ones life anyone who has a disability is definitely suffering from it whether they turn those lemons into lemonade is irrelevant and any move to suggest otherwise only provides ammunition to the twats who think that some disabilities are somehow minor whether certain things should be counted as disability some blind people might dispute blindness as a disability for a start is another matter entirely
i think doll common was from the alchemist by ben johnson in the th century i think when there were only actors male ones but then the french word actrice was used as it referred to females the word actress has its own roots unlike authoress poetess etcthe guardian ban phrases like female doctor but if you were having your privates looked at wouldnt you want to know the sex of the doctor as with actors open casting call  middle aged actors required wouldnt you want to know the sex before making the journey
more widely still isnt representative of every person suffering from mental illness nor their right to choose the language they prefer for self determining pc doesnt make you right either
we dont use the nword because it is illegal similarly the racial antidiscrimination laws need to be usedregarding other offensive dehumanising pseudo biological labelsschizophreniamentalmadetc etc
discrimination and labeling of a minority of peoplesfor a socalled biological difference is racism using the n word is illegal as should be the the m amp s words
i am always surprised though perhaps i shouldnt be by now at both the flippancy and vehemence with which people write in to comment on discrimatory and derogatory language around mental health flippancy in that some dismiss the negative impact such language can have vehemence in that some seem to get really angry about the possibility that they might have to think before they speak would these same people write in to defend their right to use racist language like the nword homophobic insults sexist language lets be very clear challenging the use of derogatory mental health terms and inaccurate language useage is not about whether an individual is personally offended it is about real harm that is done to real people it is about recognising the need for language to evolve so that it no longer demonises and ridicules a vulnerable and marginalised minority let me say it again its not about offence its about harm for instance language has a direct impact in enabling the closure of  of inpatient psychiatric beds in the past  years to go ahead with no public marches or protests when lewisham aampe was proposed for closure there were protests in the streets but cuts to mental health services are seen as a soft target one reason for that is because negative stereotypes mean people are ashamed to speak out this harms individuals with mental health problems who dont ask for or who cant access the treatment and support they need it demeans society and has a huge economic cost the long and the short of it is that negative stereotypes around mental illness mean people are suffering and even dying completely needlessly we are in the middle of a revolution around the coverage of mental illhealth and some people are angry at having to let go of their favourite old ways of expressing themselves in the same way some mourned the loss of the black amp white minstrel show
mental health problems emotional distress mental illhealth mental health difficulties there you go there are  off the top of my head its not so hard when you spend a couple of seconds thinking about it is it
its not so much about offence as real harm done to real peoples lives yes theres a difference in reach and impact between personal use with friends and family who care for you and use in the press to demonise and ridicule a vulnerable and marginalised minority if you choose to throw round the nword in private with your friends and family thats your choice personally i wouldnt because it perpetuates negative stereotypes and those negative stereotypes have a corrosive effect on society and reinforce prejudice and discrimination its just the same as negative stereotypes that spuriously link gay men and paedophiles and its just the same with derogatory terms for mental health its just weve come late to the party so were playing catch up
yes the word suffer is on the list of those that national antistigma campaign time to change recommend against using httpwwwtimetochangeorguknewsmediamediaadvisoryservicehelpjournalistsmindyourlanguage
to characterise taking ones own life as a life choice is to misunderstand suicidality for many people it is a temporary state success is when someone experiencing suicidality is treated supported or kept safe during that time success is when those people are alive today with jobs families and futures so no in many cases it is not a success if someone in a temporary state of extreme mental distress takes their own life
ill suggest that one of the reasons that racist language is less acceptable than homophobic language is simply a question of timing and thats why derogatory language around mental illhealth is still seen as broadly acceptable by many were playing catch up the derogatory language is no less damaging it is simply that weve only just started to say so
please bear in mind that the issue of language use is not simply a question of personal preference or whether or not you are personally offended it has implications for other people and for wider society too
the monster raving loony party are a throwback to the past much like the black and white minstrel show times change language evolves vulnerable and marginalised minorities stand up and demand their proper place in society are you ready for that or do you hark back to the days of blackface
whether or not you personally find the use of the term acceptable national antistigma campaign time to change who are in the business of looking at this subject more widely recommend against it take a look at their media guidance here httpwwwtimetochangeorguknewsmediamediaadvisoryservicehelpjournalistsmindyourlanguage there is a pejorative aspect to schizophrenic which is simply not applicable to other terms you list media reporting of the term is almost always related to a violent crime though of course people with mental health problems are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators you are simply mistaken that these are equivalents
or you could try to speak like a grown up the english language is rich and vibrant if youre prepared to make the effort
please bear in mind that there are wider issues at stake than whether you as an individual are offended its not about offence its about harm using mental illness as an insult has a negative effect on people with mental health problems whether or not youre offended we recognise the corrosive and damaging impact that using racist sexist and homophobic language has and it is now thankfully no longer acceptable we may be a few decades behind in challenging the ridiculing and demonisation of people with mental health problems but that just means were playing catch up
surely it makes more sense to use the term illogical than to resort to bonkers especially if you want to challenge inaccurate reporting rather than reinforce negative stereotypes around mental illhealth
its not about people being offended or not its about real harm being caused to real peoples lives
stepping away from peoples personal feelings about whether the term commit suicide is offensive or not please bear this in mind there are wider considerations than whether or not one is personally offended one such consideration is the wider impact on society and the harm that is caused to real peoples lives by using outdated language to reinforce outdated notions such as sin and crime suicide ceased to be a crime half a century ago its time to catch up the samaritans who have expertise in this field far beyond the individuals commenting here have written a guide on language use around and reporting of suicide please take a look to understand why it is important and how small changes can make a difference httpwwwsamaritansorgmediacentremediaguidelinesreportingsuicide suicide is a deeply serious issue not one for semantics and point scoring please consider that when adding comments
one of the reasons that the government is hammering people with disabilities and mental health conditions is because they can we are a vulnerable and marginalised group regularly demonised and ridiculed in the media updating language use and throwing off outdated negative stereotypes is an important part of the process of standing up to cutbacks in mental health services social security and social care support services that are so vital for people with mental health problems homophobic language used to be acceptable to throw around and that helped perpetuate ridiculous and damaging stereotypes such as linking being gay with being a paedophile now homophobic language is being challenged those negative sterotypes are being broken down too or laughed out of town at least in the uk just because mental health is late to the party in challenging the use of derogatory language doesnt mean its any less important than challenging racist homophobic and sexist language
yes it surprises me how people really want to fight for the right to use language that demonises and ridicules a vulerable and marginalised group seriously why do they want to hang onto this
if its all about context are you saying youd happily use thats so gay as a term of insult to someone so long as you know theyre straight would you call someone the nword so long as they were white what if a gay person on a black person overheard you using the words as insults similarly with insults such as loopy loon or nutjob the english language is rich with so many insults why pick on those which ridicule and demonise a vulnerable and marginalised group
accurate portrayals of mental health problems rather than sensationalism or cliche are certainly to be welcomed
and in the meantime whilst we wait for that utopia to arrive lets recognise the harm that negative sterotypes and discriminatory language causes to a vulnerable and shamed group in society
yes mental health problems are often added in to spice up stories that extra frisson for what would otherwise be fairly dull that goes towards perpetuating negative stereotypes of people with mental health problems which impact negatively on our lives
there are several points here theres a difference between a conversation youre having with friends who care for you and a headline splashed across a national newspaper friends and family can tailor their comments which are said with love not with newspaper sales in mind theres a difference between your personal preferences and the wider picture you may be happy to accept prejudice discrimination reduced services and fear on the basis of pejorative and discriminatory language i am not
its not about offence its about real harm thats caused to real peoples lives whether or not you are personally offended by being called mental or a nutter doesnt diminish the harm that use of mental illness as an insult inaccurate reporting around mental health problems eg by misuse of terms diagnoses such as schizophrenic and the inaccurate linking of mental illhealth with violent crime causes real harm to real peoples lives real harms like cutbacks in mental health services being made without protest real harms like people being put off asking for help through fear and shame and people being wrongly afraid of people with mental health problems its about harm not offence
agree context is important i refer to my meds as loony pills and have no problem with a bit of banter with my friends i will challenge anyone using terms like nutter in a derogatory way a chap i had been happily chatting with in a pub was shocked when i put him in his place after he shouted abuse at a friend of mine with schizophrenia
im also minded to recall that david cameron claimed in  that most ukip members were fruitcakes and loonies much as i loathe him im sure he was not seriously expressing a view on the pathological condition ukips members
no you might learn a better way to express yourself sorry but i dont intend to let others tell me how to express myself unless they can convince me that the phrase commit suicide is actually offensive simply saying i find it offensive is not enough
id like to know what the current pc term is for mental illness they didnt elaborate in this article they just told us what not to say anyone
im in agreement with many of the posters here i have had a history of mental health problems since childhood and dont find many words relating to mental health offensive in themselves its usage thats key i and many other people i know with mental health problems will quite happily describe myself as a bit of a fruit loop or a mentaller in part because its a way of lightheartedly broaching the topic but its not done with malice did anyone think the sun meant to be kind to frank bruno with their original headline no because the context was clearly derogative while highlighting the issue is valuable censoring it is most definitely not but dont get me started on the overuse and misuse of the terms psycho and sociopath
ultimately anything can be construed as offensive if you choose to interpret it as being so no there are plenty of things that are clearly offensive i completely agree and never denied that you appear to think the first statement rules out the second it doesnt
i loathe words like crazy mental and mad used in a social context not because of mental health issues but because they are invariably used to big up people who are merely loud in public drink too much etc its pure hyperbole used like the dreadful awesome to make the mundane sound impressive i am also a gay man who dislikes the word gay its so mimsy and craving for acceptance and carries too many connotations of fabulousness i much prefer faggot homo or chutney ferret
if one looks to be offended one inevitably will be and that phrase is the convenient crutch of the those who revel in causing offence under the spurious defence of free speech that may be so bit it doesnt make the statement untrue
i think you are perfetly right i recall thinking that frank bruno was a nutter but i hasten to add that this had nothing to do with any kind of medical condition this was when he very publicly announced that should labour win the election in  he would leave the country apparently he failed to keep his promise much to my great dismay and i think that of many others
schizophrenia n from greek skhizein to split phren diaphragm heart mind etymology online a form of mental disease in which the personality is disintegrated and detached from its environment oed so it does mean a split mind but in the sense of a mind that is split from its environment not within itself
gary have you heard the phrase useful idiots
its archaic yes but we have waiters and waitresses and the guardian doesnt blink at that i have no problem with anyone who only uses the word actor or anyone who uses both actor and actress whats a problem is being told one or the other is wrong neither are wrong its just style
many others affected just as deeply by suicide are not offended by the phrase commit suicide they should be free to use it indeed killed himself may be too active close up and visceral for some compared with the slight distance of commit suicide the very act demands a strong degree of commitment commit has a variety of connotations perhaps it is more negative for those who frame the world in socioreligious language where to commit is equated with sin and murder rather than to apply oneself fully a meaning also inherent in the phrase very sorry you have had to experience something so terrible though
the guardian is usually pretty good on reporting disability issues in general but i did have occasion last week to respond to an article that stated that a person suffered from a given condition without asking her whether she felt she did it is objective statements like this that grind my gears
if it were to gain linguistic currency absolutely yes its technically fine it just may cause confusion in the short term because people are unfamiliar with it im canceric is no different from saying im blonde im fat im thin im anaemic rather than im a person with pale hair im a person with heaviness im a person with slight stature im a person with anaemia
homosexual is a somewhat clinical term i agree and i do much prefer gay as a description as the former does make same sex attraction sound like a medical condition certainly the n word is now unacceptable and with good reason interestingly i dont think there is quite the same stigma to the use of derogatory terminology fag etc for gay or lesbian people im not sure why i think my main objection to the article above was that it is rather selfcongratulatory in tone and i guess i was saying that language is less important in depression than effective treatment for people also that where there is ignorance but not bad intent in use of language people should not feel that they are going to be attacked but the suns use of language is certainly out of line
no but believing what you read in it is
ultimately anything can be construed as offensive if you choose to interpret it as being so no there are plenty of things that are clearly offensive
no you might learn a better way to express yourself
if one looks to be offended one inevitably will be and that phrase is the convenient crutch of the those who revel in causing offence under the spurious defence of free speech
i agree with you over the whole situation vs person thing i have no problem with situations being called crazy but i do have a problem with mentally ill people being called that i also admit to calling politicians insane on occasion and im trying to stop but i would never do that if they were actually mentally ill
i have depression and i do care how mental health is referred to in the public sphere bonkers bruno is beyond offensive using terms like bonkers and nutjob and other humiliating derogatory terms can make us feel worse about ourselves we feel like the subject of ridicule and derision and it can make us feel like everyone is laughing at us lets remember when were really ill were not always thinking clearly as other commenters have said its about context one of my friends calls my adhd meds my cuckoo pills and thats fine we laugh together about my adhd symptoms and i know shes saying it with love were a national newspaper to say the same thing i would be offended lets face it most of the time mental illnessesdisorders are mentioned in the media its not in a positive way as for the whole homosexual vs gay debate heres my take on it as a bisexual the term homosexual is usually only used by those people who condemn nonheterosexuals the term gay is much friendlier and more positive and those articles begging for sensitivity for trans people well my trans friends wish folk would actually pay attention to them yes intention is important but we dont go around using the nword these days do we even if we dont mean it in a derogatory way nor do we use most racial slurs why because words matter
i agree although i did once have a head mistress
i know a lot of women who act and who call themselves actors why is this a problem do we have doctors and doctoresses no just doctors teachers and teacheresses nope teachers why should actors have different terms depending on gender its archaic
that whoopi goldberg e makes no sense whatsoever i guess she thinks a waitress can only serve women but a waiter can serve anyone they want
harriet walter is one of our finest stage actors and that includes the blokes or should actresses only be compared with other girlies
would you describe someone with cancer as canceric although zagrebista is broadly right the illness becoming the defining aspect of a person is fairly unique to mh problems
characterizing them as people with mental health problems and yourself as a person without such problems is to stigmatize them in the most basic sense we are them and they are us the difference between any two people is not nearly so great as the distance between a human being and a chimpanzee we are all human beings forget that and youve got mental patients with their patient rights without human rights something like the kind of situation weve got right now
put me down as someone else who thinks context is important in this as someone whos suffered from the more extreme end of mental health issues in terms of symptoms or treatment and ongoing nature of symptoms i dont take offence over people calling a situation mad crazy ampc however even those fairly mild words can be offensive if the person using them means them in an offensive way to refer to someone else one thing that does genuinely aggravate me though is the way schizophrenic is used so lazily even by journalists whilst best described as a spectrum disorder with an whole array of symptoms the way schizophrenic is used in nonhealth related language is nearly always meant to refer to a some kind of split or dual personality that doesnt reflect what schizophrenia actually is
with respect i dont think its the same thing at all the part of the word you are referring to i believe refers to the patent experiencing a split from reality or a division between what is real and what is not so is in fact largely accurate and in any case i think many of the people misusing it are unaware of the root definition from chambers or anywhere else for that matter often just lazy speech or journalism people not bothering to find out what things actually mean
but that wouldnt get those organisations named in the graun twice a week pr sweetie
successful suicide something that really should be an oxymoron for an article all about the power of words this knocked me back a bit are you implying that if someone takes their own lives it can never be a success what about assisted dying where the person choosing to die is doing so because life is too much of a struggle confusing i admit i may have it wrong but it seems as though you are moralising on peoples life choices not providing the safe words haven you think you are
this is mostly selfreferential selfcongratulatory rubbish if i were depressed and i have been in the past i wouldnt give two shits what the guardian referred to it as in its attemtps to be compassionate and sensitive nor do i care if im referred to as homosexual or gay when youre feeling suicidal you dont agonise over the linguistic choices made be a selfimportant journalist as with the repetitive articles begging for sensitivity to the trans community these pieces are an insult to the intelligence it is intention to hurt that counts where someone inadvertantly uses the wrong word they should not be villified for it
the number of words one ought not use about mental health issues all appeared in this article contradicting itself
in which case perhaps they shouldnt be using a word that starts with schizo which unambiguously denotes a split cleft or division chambers its like starbucks insisting that a tall coffee is the smallest coffee you can buy nothing at all to do with additional height volume or bigness of any kind
what about the monster raving loony party theyre not trying to be offensive in name or otherwise and they serve an important public function consider the wythenshawe byelection for example the loonies got  votes enough to make the liberals lose their deposit

its madness gone politically correct
personally i think our words and synonyms for crazy are some of the best words in the english language bonkers is a great word though maybe doolally is my favourite i have a soft spot for lunacy too especially when the moon wanes the thai language has a few great sayings too im sure most of us have heard of ting tong even if we didnt know what it meant ba ba bo bo is a great one too have been called most of them in my time probably rightfully so never bothered me one bit at the end of the day what political correctness always forgets and will never overcome is that the use of words is always about social and semantic context and speaker intention and intension
thank you i enjoyed reading this post i think that it explored all of the nuances surrounding this issue very well i have experienced extreme emotional distress and have received input from mental health services not always by choice i do not take medication and havent seen a psychiatrist or indeed any professional regarding my mental health for  years when talking to those that i trust about my old life i use words such as crazy mental and nuts never psycho or schizo though i find the former to be a more accurate description for me more so than the cold clinical terms that were attached to me with their miserable implications for my future the words that i use when in safe company for me better describe the depth chaos and fluidity of how i felt back then the author hits the nail on the head i believe i certainly wouldnt dream of using this language in front of people that wouldnt understand where i was coming from or people that i could potentially cause hurt or offence to i saw this article and thought that i would wholly disagree with it just goes to show you should never pre judge thank you gary nunn
the misuse of psychotic to mean violentally aggressive really gets my goat people with psychotic disorders are vulnerable and are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators the media including the guardian are guilty of this all the time
if changing the way we describe it encourages just one person to talk about how they feel then it will have been worth it sorry but the language of billions of people cannot operate on that basis if it did we would all be afraid to say anything
as the father of someone who killed himself at the age of  after suffering from depression for many years i can assure you that there are plenty of us who find the phrase commit suicide deeply offensive as someone who recieved a liver transplant as the result of a suicide attempt im perplexed at why you would find it offensive particularly as there is clearly no offense intended and plenty as i said ive never come across anyone who finds it offensive ultimately anything can be construed as offensive if you choose to interpret it as being so
is schizophrenia a condition widely associated with other species or perhaps objects adjectives pertaining to conditions should be and invariably are used neutrally person ofwith x treads perilously close to the whole county hall in the s coffee with milk instead of white coffee nonsense zagrebista is right ive always been more offended by people using kind or neutral phrases because the intent behind them to patronise and belittle is where the poison is
context is the key here if someone uses a word that is outdated but it cannot be reasonably expected for them to know that then thats forgivable to be honest more than the words im concerned about the medias current lets experiment attitude towards mental heath whoever thought asking two ocd sufferers to clean a horders house from top to bottom on a channel  programme was making an incisive contribution to understanding either of those two conditions with incidental music and amusing voice over to boot did not make an accurate judgement in my view
yes
to be fair commit has other meanings we commit to all sorts of things relationships for example a commitment is something we must do we commit things to memory there is a sense of inevitability about the word but yes i see that it comes from the same root as commit murder so i can understand why some might not be happy about its use
we commit crimes and sins thats the origin of the use of the word it was a mortal sin possibly still is in some religions and until the s it was a crime to attempt suicideso commit suicide sometimes its the impact of the words we use on how people think about things that matters not just whether or not they are offensive they give a message about how society thinks and that is what we need to be careful about
i have always felt the term schizophrenic to be particularly stigmatising being the subject it is dehumanising much better person with schizophrenia unfortunatley many health professional dont seem to get this
ah you did in an earlier post
 there are plenty of us who find the phrase commit suicide deeply offensive could you explain why i have experience of this situation myself admittedly we tend to say killed himself but only because it sounds more like normal speech id always looked upon the word commit as being indicative of the final nature of the action rather than it having any religious or legal meaning i dont find it offensive and nobody else i know has mentioned it either thought i shall ask their opinion
fuckin right stu totally agree
by saying that social media trolls encouraged charlotte dawson to kill herself you are comparing serious bullying to rickrolling something which as a victim of bullying i find deeply offensive on a personal level please use the term bully instead of troll when referring to bullies and save the term troll for the rickrolls and the glass onions of this world
id just like to add that one of the major barriers to getting people to talk about feeling suicidal which often stops them doing it is the stigma associated with suicide we commit sins or crimes both of which descrbed suicide in the recent past and thats where the term comes from so yes there are very valid reasons for not suggesting to people that they are thinking about a crime or a sin when they are thinking about killing themselves if changing the way we describe it encourages just one person to talk about how they feel then it will have been worth it if youve got any doubts just look at the choose life advertising campaign in scotland for how people are afraid of looking in those dark places
as the father of someone who killed himself at the age of  after suffering from depression for many years i can assure you that there are plenty of us who find the phrase commit suicide deeply offensive
good post well said
very goodi agree entirely
you could replace manic day at work with super busy day at work if you wanted to sound like a yearold valley girl yes
im much the same have classic ocd symptoms but my place is a bloody mess if anyone wants to query the condition get them to watch me make sure my front door is locked before going on holiday for a day or two
i have mental health problems ocd since childhood its occasionally helpful particularly in a work environment but frequently a nuisance especially when i just want to lock a door and leave a building without having to go back and check it half a dozen times or want to go to bed and go to sleep without worrying that ive left on a device ive checked is off already several times ive been told i should be offended if someone uses ocd to describe overtidyness or particularness should i its wrong from a medical point of view but why should it bother me if anything i welcome the term being more in the open ocd isnt a cuddly funny condition that means people put their pencils in a neat row its a nuisance and it impacts on daytoday life and more importantly it doesnt go away someone with ocd can appear frankly bizarre and even slightly frightening at times as a previously rational person starts doing odd and irrational things with a look of pure determination on their face but that misuse of ocd is a way of opening a door oh you have ocd im a bit like that oh i see its not quite like that tell me more the language issue i have similar problems with ive never been bothered by words like nutter or loon in fact i frequently use them myself especially when dealing with some of the opinions on this bloody website its the way theyre deployed ive always been more offended by people using kind or neutral phrases because the intent behind them to patronise and belittle is where the poison is i dont think we remove prejudice by putting on the policemans uniform and demanding people use prescribed language i think we do it by removing ignorance and making people see people as people i dont think its language thats the key to this but education and plain old knowing someone from a marginalised group personally policing language is never popular and rarely easy and rarely right take off the policemans uniform and put on the teachers mortar board youll get where you want to go much quicker and youll make a lot more friends
susannah wilson an actor talk about political correctness gone mad
ok ill bite yesterday i saw someone get off the bus but i couldnt identify the persons gender saw someone get off the bus yesterday couldnt tell whether it was a man or a woman nice examples though since the point about gender is neatly wrapped up in the sentence itself still have yet to see a realworld example that convinces me though
your comment literally made me laugh out loud 
neutral gender and genderneutral is the same thing
i think there is a confusion of arguments there is one argument about the use of the plural pronoun they in the singular to avoid for example having to write heshe where the gender is unknown i have no problem with this it is offered as a solution to what is indeed a genuine problem another option in long legal documents is to state at the beginning of the document that use of the male pronoun should be taken to include the female pronoun or some such rather ungainly provision but at least it does then allow you to use he throughout the rest of the document having first defined your term the second argument is that other options are sexist and by implication that those proposing them are sexist and perhaps unfortunately people have muddied the waters by discussing alarmbell ringing debates surrounding words such as actress or chairman chairperson chair i really dont see why the debate has to get sabotaged as a slanging match between one group implying that another group is sexist although i can see that this has indeed been encouraged by the editors choice of title to the article sexist language well i suppose it spices things up a bit
on a trip to the highlands several months ago i found myself chatting to a couple from a texas she was remarking that their accent is a bit of a giveaway as is their use of yallbut how else would you make it clear its a plural youbeing a glaswegian i was quick to reply youse
httpericedgovided
thx i also think your comment uncovers a deeper hidden sense to this a person this a person that stuff and that is the kind of phrase is inherently masculine that is it is a statement about mankind note that uses naturally a man as an example think of armstrong neil not louis and anyway if people are arguing it is a modern and groovy way of avoiding the problem id have thought thackeray was more than a little outdated your point about she is spot on and i do mean i use it in translation which is of course a written form of english as an interpreter im not one i would have to rephrase or spell it out i do try and avoid even she where at all possible the more one looks at the problem the more one realises that it is almost always a lazy anachronism and is entirely avoidable
most sexist and racist language arises from the presumption that everyone is male and white complete bollocks sexist and racist language arises from a few people presuming it is so
notproperty  october  pm  in greek the word for manperson is masculine but i can still say she is a strange personthe she will use the feminine form and the adjective and noun are masculine absolutely no contradiction at all in greek
we do have a singular neutral version of he and she it is called it but here youre confusing the neutral gender with genderneutral it in english refers to something which has no gender in english this would be an inanimate object although even then there are some that are referred to as having a gender such as boats being traditionally referred to as she rather than referring to something that has a gender but which is unknown or variable which is why we generally dont use it to refer to people
i agree so does everyone thats what the study proved what they were wanting to do was to dispel the commonly held notion that when people use the word man or mankind to describe the human race they use it in a genderinclusive sense
it depends do they refer to you as she madam woman or a gentleman worker can you multitask
this is an edited extract from for who the bell tolls one mans quest for grammatical perfection by david marsh published by guardian faber that pretty much explains the quality and content then
i have read several academic monographs in which a female author used she exclusively as a generic term i prefer it to all the suggestions above it seemed initially at least a much bolder statement than the use of slashes etc which is annoyingly pc and which looks awful it was a unilateral f you appropriation of something rather than a compromise for a male reader more accustomed to reading he it felt exclusory at the beginning which is presumably how many women feel when they encounter he all the time after a couple of pages though i forgot about it and it became just another part of the authors style as a principle this would mean an author using generic terms appropriate to their own gender in one sense this would be more progressive insofar as it would require male readers to inhabit the subject position of she in the same way that women have been required to inhabit the subject position he but it could also be seen as more conservative because male writers would keep using he
orwell knew that language reflects and influences thought processes challenging how we say things is challenging how we think in the s my union branch had a row about changing chairman to chair in order to challenge real sexism that existed in the attitudes of some officers the argument over language was a proxy for differences in ideology if its only a word why do people make such a fuss over making it more inclusiveampnbspampnbsp the element of controlling language is already present in traditional usage that assumes the only people who matter are property owning white males
i recently read an article in the national geographic about endangered languages around the world there is a remote south american tribe whose pronouns describe not only ones gender but things like this is my nd sisters husbands oldest brothers rd daughter probably no surprise that this language is endangered
in my work most of my colleagues are female and they frequently reference to things like manflu and take about men not being able to multitask etc is this sexism and should i care
i translate into english and no it has never come up on the forum i am talking here about the question of sexism not how you get around the problem of whether for example in a legal document you have to write he or she throughout which is an issue that does come upbut even if it did come up i am sure it would be a measured debate amongst professionals about which way the language is heading not a handbag fight as to whether or not any particular way of expressing oneself was sexist anyone here offering the opinion that usage of the words discussed isnt sexist seems to be having the allegation levelled against them that they must therefore be sexist themselves
if you say man at war i think soldier and virtually all of them are men if you say warfare i think bombed out cities victims of war and so on as well as the soldiers and the soldiers are still mostly men
this kind of exists in other languages in lithuanian for example there is the possessive pronoun savo which means his hers and theirs but the gender will have been established earlier eg heshethey go to the pool with hishertheir familyjisjijei eina i baseina su savo seima
kizbot  october  am  i agree about chair it uses the location of the speaker much as we attribute government announcements to downing street or the white house theres a word for it though i cant remember the grammatical term
skipissatan  october  pm  i cant think of anything major off hand no ive been using they their etc as generics since childhood becuase it solved a problemif you have a specific example then do show it and ill tell you what id do
back in  when i started my ba there was no question about which pronoun to use everyone wrote they their in their essays then i went to study abroad in  nonenglish speaking country and i noticed that some of my professors advocated the use of she in one case they their was even marked as a mistake i didnt know whether to laugh or cry but anyway from my experience this whole debate is a result of the fact that english is being manhandled by a feminists who feel the need to complicate things to make an in this case useless point and b nonnative englishspeakers who adopt this ridiculous habit because they dont know any better
i once had a teacher whose surname was sheehy pron she he i was never sure whether to say sir or miss
mrtarifa  october  pm  why would you use heesh if the sexgender of someone is stated youd use the relevant he or she unless you think its possible that sarah could be a boys name there would be no need for using a generic
mancuniensis  october  pm  are you translating into english or from english and im surprised its never come up because its been an issue in efl world for like forever the rule being that both are acceptable but consistency required
no
i pine for the old days when scottish legislation regularly put this statement in the small print for the purposes of construing this act man shall embrace woman
frogbloke  october  pm  ah you come from that strange world where a word can only have one possible meaning and all other usages confuse yousorry cant help
the logic and good intentions are admirable but they still feels simply well wrong when shoehorned into the singular and this is the guardian remember where shakespeare is not automatically admitted as an authority on language just think of c p scotts carpeting of neville cardus for using from whence cardus ventured to point out to scott that the phrase was used by respected writers including fielding scott replied mr fielding would not use it twice in my paper cardus prudently forebore to point out that from whence occurs  times in shakespeare and in  places in the authorised version of the bible

where it works i dont have a problem with it where it mangles language and makes things soundawkwardi take issue do you concede that there are cases where trying to make things gender neutral becomes a little cumbersome
dorothydix  october  pm  you know what happens when anyone ever outs themselves as a pedant dont you
who says its use is generally not interpreted as sexist you who is this generally me yes and the people i associate with and the fact that the only place in which i seem to be confronted with this issue is the guardian which though i enjoy reading it or i wouldnt be here is hardly the mouthpiece of the majority of the population nor is it something every raised in my work as a translator nor by translators generally in the translators forum i am a member of
but since linguistic gender and biological sex are not the same thing your claim of humiliation could be taken as ignorant i find it entirely conceivable that in a society in which biological sex is considered relatively unimportant but which uses a strongly gendered language your objection to referring to groups of mostly female humans in the linguistic masculine could itself be interpreted as sexist imagine a member of such a society objecting to your apparent refusal to recognise that a bunch of mostly women could legitimately form as valid a group as a bunch of men if their word for driver is feminine they might object to a sentence such as when the driver asked me which way to turn i told him to turn right on the grounds that a man is just as capable of being a driver as a woman why they might ask if biological sex should be of no relevance do you want to change linguistic gender on the basis of biological sex from the perspective of a native english speaker linguistic gender may indeed seem obviously sexist but to native speakers of strongly gendered languages things might sometimes look very different
lack of gender pronouns would certainly make sending out breast cancer screening letters more challenging
sauroter  october  pm  nope its a greek word
surely this is discrimination against all of us that arent cockney barrow boys
skipissatan  october  pm  so youd never say each to their own youd say each to his own or each to his or her own the first really does imply only men it doesnt read generically in any way to my ears the second is really awkward the use of they as a generic has been around a very long time and i started using it in the th year of junior school because it made sense i didnt even know the word feminist thenits the least awkward way to express the generic and it doesnt sound like newspeak at all
skyscapes  october  am  language tends to evolve to reflect the word as it is not as it was hence the daily mails horror at changing language

one occasion in about twenty million how many trans who must have decided on a sex to be i assume or cross dressing spokes thingies and chair wotsits do you think there are in the world i cant really see any justification for changing the language of the other  just to avoid upsetting them perhaps if its a bloke its a chairman if its a woman its a chairwoman chairs i sit on them
women are winning the race because they have higher iqs are harderworking more determined more balanced have more to lose if they dont youre complaining about sexism whilst being sexist its this kind of nonsense that means that i will never identify as feminist but as an egalitarian
so does herpes become personpes then
theres a lot wrong with they its plural thats whats wrong in english the masculine often includes the feminine and theres nothing wrong with that
convention no that doesnt answer my question you merely told me how often it is used not why it is used
a minority of feminists who give the rest a bad name in desperate attempt to destroy the english language with newspeakperhaps they could focus an an actual equality issue where they would have my support rather than tedious nonsense about convention and pronouns
how about blud innit
would be considered offensive because it would suggest that they are an inanimate object in iain m banks culture series of novels machines above a certain level of sentience are given full personhood and citizenship they are routinely referred to as it without any implied insult on reading a culture novel for the first time it is interesting how quickly one becomes accustomed to this usage
as one of two engineers who are female in my team of  i find myself getting particularly annoyed when colleagues use the term gents when addressing emails to the whole team
mancuniensis  october  pm  who says its use is generally not interpreted as sexist you who is this generally ah i see its your opinion trying to sneak in as a factim not hurt by the use of he in the generic im annoyed and i dont like it so i therefore dont use it they has long been an acceptable alternative
how do you pronounce it
anglers maybe
love the list of rhyming words that would make a hell of a rap 
wont somebody please think of the missing hyphens
so you have to repeat sarah or use she or heesh lol
i cant recommend this comment enough
i believe that replacing history with herstory was a radical feminist joke while they seriously decided to change the spellings of woman and women to such things as womyn wombyn wimmin and womon
i always loved winniethepooh but now even a bit more
in your ideal world but thats not everyones ideal world what a dull world it would be if all our ballads poems and novels were written without specifying gender why what is it about gender being specified every time a person is mentioned that makes ballads poems and novels exciting to you personally im more interested in the writing style the emotion the narrative the characters the themes and a million other things
well since singular they is the most natural form used by almost everyone in informal spoken language and has been around for centuries its all the other versions including he that are imposed by prescriptivists trying to regulate the language going on about how singular they is illogical or whatever other arguments since when was language ever logical
i think singular they their works well although of the examples given only the thackeray really works as the others refer to a number of people to some degree its a frsutrating issue and i get annoyed when people referring to my dog who is femail isnt he lovely or is he friendly i suppose for a dog you could just use it but i cant think of her as an it aaahh
lady doctor still exists as in female patients with gynaecological intimate personal or emotional problems will often ask to see a lady doctor presumably for reasons of modesty or because we might be considered to be more sympathetic i know when i see patients if the reason the the appointment says personal asked to see a lady doctor it means tears and tissues andor an intimate examination
she suits me
e finks i stole is pencil and gave it to er but i never stole no pencil
fish relocation expert
or just situations where you havent met the person and they have a genderneutral or unfamiliar name
but if its use is not intended as sexist if its use is generally not interpreted as sexist then i dont see the problem i see the argument that language changes what i dont buy is the hurt sensibility of people who say they feel offended let the language change of its own accord because people think it should change but dont let it become some kind of linguistic witch hunt
thank fuck for that never know on cif
only one word to say sheesh
makuribu  october  pm  its not even pedantry a true pedant would acknowledge that they has been used successfully for the generic for a very long time at the moment its simply a matter of preference which you use as both are grammatically correct and entirely accepted in academic grammar circles
mrtarifa  october  pm  why would you use they for sarah in your example you would use she were talking about the generic use of they their them instead of the generic he his him etcyour example therefore makes no sense at all im afraid
hooray hooray for the singular they its a word it works and only grammatical pedants have a problem with itand if sie wants to complain heesh can take it outside
isnt it the royal prerogative no it used to be more common in the expensively educated middle class than it is now but its simply fallen most of the way into disuse for whatever reason you could try reviving it by using it oneself

calmeilles  october  am  then why comes no ones has a problem with you are a foolyou are fools
maybe we need to boldly tweak the language even more in the situation you describe it might be clearer to say they was awake all night etc in london essex london essex london essex they was awake all night could easily mean the whole group not just one individual
oh my god really when did that happen some time in the nineties toni blair i think it was she started the war in iraq with georgie bush whose surname should really be genderneutralised perhaps georgie pubic hair
theres nothing wrong with singular they apart from the ambiguity of course sarah went to the pub with tim and tom and then they went home all three just sarah as for heesh thats a joke right
dorothydix  october  pm  no the greek word historia is not neutral its feminine its η ιστορια
the traditional remedy still advocated by many armchair grammarians has been to treat everyone as if they were male and use he to cover both or resort to clumsy constructions such as he or she or hisher but wait the traditional ungrammatical remedy is to use they as you demonstrate so well in this sentence we should count ourselves lucky at least we dont have mme le ministre
are you making a joke about the definition of status quo or arguing that change has never occurred
foarp  october  am  except thats never happened in the thirty years ive been using the term
why not develop the gender neutrality of the ists like dentists artists cyclists so fishermanwoman becomes fishist or fisheristchairman chairist postman postist actists clergyist waitist spaceist conductist sportist etc such fun
while i also dislike all the zanu liebore rubbish ive always liked the condems not out of any bitterness for the coalition i just like it
but there is a difference between natural ground up change and change forced upon us top down by persons in authority and pressure groups using the singular they is natural ground up change its the alternatives genderneutral he or heshe that are imposed from the top by grammatical prescriptivists singular they has been in use for centuries one of the es up there is from shakespeare i think i can honestly say i have never heard the genderneutral he is informal spoken language unless someone is making a statistically reasonable assumption about the gender of a given unknown person assuming its a postman rather than postwoman but then again in my experience its just as standard to use assume an unknown shop assistant or teacher will be a woman and use she
as a pedant the whole debate bugged me the word history is an anglicisation of the greek word historia which means things that have happened incidentally it is neutral in gender
zhrskih  october  am  why is it ghastly its simply a tool for the people who work at the graun most newspapers and publishing houses produce style guides for staff
is it really important to give extra unessesary information to a messagetake the french je suis jean un vieux con i am jean an old get in the french ive told someone  times that im male  times that i am the first person in the singular and finally that im not worth talking to in the english  times a male if you count jean as a lads nameand  times im the first person singular and of course the information telling you im not worth talking to i say bring back declension as in saxon times it wont help a bit keep to your stupid grammar rules as john cleese said romans they go to the house and was ordered to write it out  times
what dogmatic gender politics youre not fooling anyone but yourself with this
frogbloke  october  am  you really cant think of any situation where it might not be obvious never heard of trans people or cross dressers
i only know of the research thirdhand douglas hofstadter wrote about it in his fascinating article changes in default words and images in which he in turn ed from the book words and women which describes the research i just took metamagical themas off the shelf and looked it up it seems the research was carried out in  by joseph schneider and sally hacker and some of the subjects in question were social man society industrial man industrial life political man political behavior but i cant find the original research so i dont know if these are accurate and yes youre right that these subjects can be interpreted differently but in many ways thats the entire point because people like to claim that man is just a generic term for human beings but in reality thats not the case its a loaded term that comes with lots of baggage hofstadter refers to it as the slippery slope of sexism
family man is clearly a different subject to families a mother or a daughter is certainly not a family man but the point is that in the past man was used in these contexts to refer to people in general in ways that now we wouldnt dream of doing i have a childrens encyclopaedia from the s at home its all man this man that men the black man the white man frenchmen etc etc
most women are now referred to by masculine titles such as manager comedian although we still have actresses so i see no problem with a masculine pronoun
great post
i must be imagining things i thought they was plural a neuter pronoun for either would be it semanticists please reply
the latter suggestion sounds acceptable 
i live in poland and i think im right in saying that in polish theres a pronoun for a group made up entirely of women but if even a single man is a part of that group then regardless of how many women there are the male equivalent pronoun must be used
dont be pompous you know thats not what the issue is here youll find no greater feminist in the true sense of the word than me but i refuse to be drawn in by the idea that womens rights can be furthered by window dressing the language they is fine in certain contexts but its not a feminist tool
i very much agree with the need for a genderless set of pronouns in english such a thing would be very useful for referring to persons whose gender is unknown or irrelevant i write instruction manuals amongst other things so i would find genderless pronouns most useful how convenient it would be not to have to write heshe himher or hishers alternating the masculine and feminine forms as has been suggested by some here i find messy as has been pointed out the english language does have a neuter form it but as it is used for inanimate objects and most animals it does not seem suitable for people some might take offence i disagree with the use of plural forms for a singular pronoun simply because of the confusion caused as to the number of persons referred to and because it sounds so cumbersome especially with a singular verb a new set of pronouns would therefore be welcome many suggestions have been made from borrowing words from other languages to dropping the initial t from the plural pronouns hey hem heir but getting everyone to agree on a single set would be like trying to get all european counties to agree on a single electrical socket standard or a single language for eu meetings and documents
imagine a newspaper that had endless dreary articles about one sex but a very sparse helping of equivalent dreary articles about the other sex never done the mail any harm
randomadvice certainly not your maj
ive done this since primary school and im  furthermore we were taught to do this at primary all those years ago and i cant really see how this is an issue today
yes i realize that i think i just like to be a bit contrary from time to time i works that way in all the romance languages and in german too so maybe english is the one out of step
if you love somebody set them free etc as the article says this has long been used the language lacks a singular anonymous unisex pronoun as for all the poor guys who find this outrageous try reversing things would you be happy to be referred to as she
the author unfortunately should take into account that way too many people mostly men of course get very sensitive about these kinds of suggestions and see them as categorical they need a pat on the head and to be told and if you say he instead of they every once in a while it doesnt mean youre a bad person
others recalled reading books as children about experiences they would have liked to have had but couldnt because it was always a he on the adventure oh purlease
well if you read the guardian youre going to get battered with it on a regular basis
if that seems discriminatory then you just dont understand noun gender in languages
perhaps you could guess and risk being corrected or just say with cream
turkish hungarian finnish persian are entirely genderlessi guess that must explain why iran is such a utopia for women compared to the english speaking world
sorry i only teach advanced 
i just use she alwayshelps redress the balancei am trying women to replace guys
happy to helpif you started with dales spenders man made language and then read margaret atwoods the handmaids tale you might move on a bit help you avoid such naif and socially unaware statementsfeminism has had a few waves but those two books are quite easy and accessible for the beginnerboth are quite well known and you could try your local library
grow up
if i dont know the partners gender i should choose this version
please come back after the last of your primary english classes
actually speaking from experience it doesnt you just tell people about it in a sensible manner and its easy
yesthats apparently because das mädchen is a diminutive the chen ending and for some reason all diminutives must by law be neuter as your great countryman mark twain once observed in german a turnip has a sex a pretty young girl has none
id go for theytheir where possible unless the sex is known but there are certainly some cases where its awkward or ambiguous like an obedient child will eat up their greens youre thinking whose greens in those cases its best to throw in the towel and rewrite obedient children will
sounds like a trick question to me
indeed most words for penis in french are feminine and most vagina words are masculine whats all the fuss
drudge noun in french is a female gender word that is precisely the kind of thing that seems discriminatory to me
if the teacher identifies the culprits they go to the principal who does they refer to
this reminds me of the usage prevalent in the bureaucracy a few decades ago subordinate officers used to address their superiors in indirect speech instead of second person singular that is instead of saying if it pleases you sir i will forward it to they used to say if it pleases the manager sir i will forward etc this is circumlocution of some sort i believe this has been discontinued since is the debate on feminism and lgbt issues seeing a revival of this practice all in the name of a proper pronoun in english 
jesus christ someone has far too much time on their hands whining about sexism in language first world problems and the overindulged product of a comfortable and privileged lifestyle
havent we always had a similar problem with you relying on context or qualifying the number somehow for clarity seems to have worked okay managing this with they shouldnt be any worse though it must make learning english as a second language more complex
only if its ghostbusters
well they can ignore them then cant they
my partner likes strawberries ah do they like them with cream sorry i respect your view but it sounds terrible to me
oh thou artst so wrong 
im not saying the singular they doesnt exist eg someones parked their car in my drive but to exaggerate its use in order to totally eliminate gender from the language is sillyunnecessary delete as appropriate
i think its an encouraging sign that feminism only has matters of this level of insignificance to complain about these days equality in the vast majority of practical senses must have been achieved guess i dont need to pay attention to it anymore
yes but until people started getting upset about it we all were taught that he used like that referred to everyone whatever they wereyou probably wouldnt plan the language like that now but it is tradition and to be honest i dont think it does much harm
continuing the linguistic idiocy ad nauseam
i agree we need a word for shehe but they is confusing how about shehe
during the first week of my theology and religious studies degree i approached my personal tutor to ask if i could use the genderneutral pronoun hesh in my essays he agreed without hesitation it wasnt a particularly controversial accommodation back in  but we seem to have walked backwards over gender issues during the last few decades at least in some respects not in others thankfully feminist theology didnt even get a mention in my theology lectures the department now boasts about teaching the subject on its website back in  one tutor did deride my use of hesh not for its politics but for its lack of elegance perhaps he had a point but i cant see anything wrong with they i hope its use catches on
id say my partner likes strawberries ah do they like them with cream undefined to maintain privacyortheres somebody at the door asking for you what do they want undefined because unknown
ok bad example see other posts for better examples but they is the third person singlular unknown pronoun and has been for yonks
whats wrong with he or she
couldnt increased use of they turn out to be divisive as it would encourage thinking in terms of us and them rather than considering people as individuals i dont think lorraine berry has thought this through
as a technical writer i have been using they in the singular for years for example if the manager approves the request they forward it to hr much better than if the manager approves the request he or she forwards it to hr or if the managerthe manager forwards never had a problem with it
this sort of pedantry is why i am such a hit with the ladies sobs softly to self
completely disregarding the possible psychological implications of speaking since infancy or childhood as a finnish friend observed to me if you think having nongendered pronouns makes any difference to sexism you are clearly an idiot
does a change like this add greater clarity to what a person is saying to be exact again them of venerable usage in this sense is used when clarity is not sought and there is a wishnecessityignorance regarding indefinition whole languages can be built upon nonclarity cf in general semitic
if youve had children together my husbandwife
same goes with the people saying we
but one is first person not third person one is disappointed at your lack of knowledge
whats wrong with being sexy
well said
are you serious not who is it
len peterson not fussy at all the apostrophe is as important as the pronoun do away with grammar and you do not know for sure whats what
by that argument as you sounds singular you need a different word for second person plural
that is standard third person unknown and has been for centuries theres somebody at the door who are they
one would very quickly be put in ones place if one were to use one where i come from
growing up almost two centuries later i was just supposed to understand that language excluded me because i was a girl dear god
i just want to tell the world that ive been using they like since childhood i knew it was an official rule but it just felt correctalso i capitalise the first letter of a word to indicate italics or ation marks when messagingam i a genius do i win a prize
the moment maria munir told barack obama they were nonbinary surely they was
im not american so i wouldnt know for sure although i guess that that in your example with words such as someone anyone etc they would say exactly as you say the problem i think is with nongenderspecific words such as person child candidate etc an interesting read on this subject in particular on british and american acceptance of the indeterminate they is the paragraph acceptability and prescriptive guidance in the wiki page singular they
theres nothing to suggest that shes liberal either
a person cant help their birth i think i used to employ this logic as standard when i was younger but have started to use one instead not that i would ever have reason to say it but one cant help ones birth i do this not just because i am pretentious but because i live in france and in french one often reverts to the impersonal thirdperson pronoun on and therefore the possessive pronouns sonsases that accompany it part of the reason for this is simplicity you can avoid trickier conjugation that way it still strikes me as strange to see nongendered announcements and adverts like this but in fact it is quite straightforward when i was first learning french i would tend due to my english try to use on with leurs a bit like their which is wrong you cant say one cant help their birth in french

michelle obama
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening er you clearly did not read the subheading of your own article a backlash against politically correct language ignores the deeper oppression that unchecked microaggressions inflict on groups such as women and black people which is clear evidence of the very thing you claim to be terrified of
thats the entire magazine youve linked to but googling the original article that there was a physical altercation is particularly relevant here he doesnt substantiate his claim that the only reason it was prosecuted was because the other person was gay
ah that explains why your reasoning is so simplistic
my god yes ban anyone convincing phew thanks for saving us all
progressive tyrrany makes more sense progressives have coopted the labels and language of liberalism but in absolutely no way can their actions be considered liberal conflating progressivism with liberalism leads to all manner of woes
unfortunately we have collectively developed an incredibly childish way of envisaging how freedom of speech works and every time you write an article like this youll be subjected to comments from those who imagine themselves morally unimpeachable for parroting the usual nonsense about defending to the death your right to say it some of those people if theyre reading this will now already be readying their response to this comment which will imply im akin to the villains out of  or worse getting them to fucking think about why they think what they think and why its limiting is incredibly difficult the childish way we have of thinking about freedom of speech goes like this there are two categories things that violate freedom of speech and things that dont violate freedom of speech if you do anything that fits into the first category you are joseph stalin reborn but if you do things that fit into the second category no problem in the first category they want to put things like noplatforming and cancelling twitter accounts alongside the more obvious imprisoning people in the second category they merrily put the deliberate spread of disinformation in order to devalue a group massbadgering and hate speech itself even though all of these things can have a dissuasive effect on the open sharing of views and experiences a much better way of thinking about freedom of speech for anyone who is genuinely interested in the problem is to have an imaginary box labelled negative effects of speech and another labelled tools for responding to the negative effects of speech the issue becomes one of finding the right tool for the right context in the first box you have everything from cause irritation through individual harm and societal oppression right down to commanding your followers to commit genocide in the toolbox of responses you have everything from ignore them and laugh at them through to counterargument all the way down to imprisonment and exile the question should always be about the right tool to address the potential harm done by speech which in most cases is going to be a very modest one like counterargument people who come to this topic just bleating its censorship its censorship like a confused dalek are contributing nothing to the debate and need to stop and think
if its ok even encouraged to some extent for me to hate socialism or conservatism or nazism why isnt it ok for me to hate jainism or norse paganism or islam you really dont want to piss off thor
dont harm your children by making their lives too easy the education system especially in universities has pandered to the selfish needs of the young and as such they have never realised they cant always get their own way this snowflake means that their maturity and compsure melts when faced with any opposition incidentally a side effect is the increasing tendency to selfharm amongst teenage girls i think the current rate is now  in  think about it httpswwwtheguardiancomsocietymayshockfiguresselfharmenglandteenagers
so the author believes free speech is essential to the extent that it should be formally protected except in instances where offence could be directed at women lgbt and racial groups racial groups here defined as black people as this makes life harder for those groups the author identifies those most vocal against political correctness as straight white men of a certain class group with no supporting evidence provided the crowing response to the downfall of milo yiannopolous is very telling he may be an odious opportunistic nincompoop who clearly does not believe much if any of what he says but he certainly provided a valuable service in illustrating the blazing hypocrisy of many people regarding this issue
i agree when a word is well established it is not ok for me to come along and try and get rid of it as i have decided it offends mebut when people start to use words differently or introduce them to contexts they did not used to be in i think the people the word is being used to describe should be able to point it out and be listened to if they dont want that word to change to cover themit is a fairly recent change that the q word is being used in articles instead of or interchangeably with gay man every time it happens there are comments below from specifically british gay men asking for it not to happen i dont see that with any other word being used in this publication so would describe it as a fairly strongly and widely held view so why is it being ignored

yes speech can be very harmful but i think that the person using the speech has to have the intention of it being harmful in order for them to be blamed for the speech being harmfulif i say to you that you look nice today it could bring up all your insecurities about your physical appearance and therefore be harmful if that wasnt my intention i shouldnt be blamed for the harm its caused you
i wont answer on behalf of ultralightbeam but the truth is that some opinions are more valid than others i value the opinion of david attenborough when it comes to issues about wildlife and the environment more than john down the pub who read in the mail that global warming is rubbish for example maybe ultralightbeam is especially qualified to comment maybe not but this automatic assumption that all opinions are equally valid and should be accorded equal credence is obviously nonsense
if however i call moroccans scum as geert wilders did it is more than offensive it is an invitation to harm moroccans no it isnt words have meaning and you cannot just change them to suit your agenda calling a group of people scum may well be a nasty thing to do but it is still just namecalling anyone who chooses to cause physical harm to another is responsible for their own actions
theres a debate to be had about how we define free speech but as long as katie hopkins above is still getting published in a hugely popular paper its largely academic oh the irony its beyond parody it appears there is not a debate to be had about free speech you couldnt make this up orwell would be proud
is physical harm worse than psychological harm many would disagree you dont harm people with speech they may be upset by it but tough actually mrs whitehouse may not have liked certain plays but likewise tough speech is an act it can be incredibly harmful and destructive if you cant understand this youve had a very privileged existence which might have made you exceedingly naive and not a little callous give it a rest with the privileged existence stuff my old china i am not checking my privilege thanks its a crap argument that seeks to shut down debate yy elevating or downgrading someones opinion based on who they are and not what they say its another illiberal discrimination technique the callous comment is also a crap argument philosophically in essence it amounts to deciding the merits of an idea based on the reaction of the least logical and most emotional person that hears it its pure nonsense on stilts its clear you are not a liberal but lucky for you there are still some of us about that will protect your right to have illiberal ideas and to argue for the restriction of other peoples freedoms well let you argue for it but well fight for the rights of your intended victims as well
you do realise that the term ice maidens was chosen by the army women who formed the team do you really think  trained soldiers some of senior rank would not have spoken up if they didnt like it was asking how they would have a pee really the only question
it seems that being offended isnt something youre prepared to tolerate yourself if you stopped reading because of what it might say
i think what people want here is consistency either it must be ok to offend anybody or nobody at all there must be no special dispensation for certain groups or for people whore particularly thinskinned frankly i think our experiment in criminalising hate speech has been a failure and should be abandoned for two reasons  what constitutes hate speech is poorly defined extremely broad and too open to interpretation  frankly who are the government to dictate to me whether im allowed to hate something or not if its ok even encouraged to some extent for me to hate socialism or conservatism or nazism why isnt it ok for me to hate jainism or norse paganism or islam society should be capable of regulating itself it should not be for government to regulate what we are allowed to say or to think assuming of course were not inciting the commission of criminal activity be honest has society become more or less tolerant since hate speech became a crime if these laws were intended to make us all get along better theyre clearly failing

the guardian has published  articles about yiannopolouss recent fall from grace but not one has been openforcomments says a lot about how terrified the pcmicroagression loons feel about our harmless little milo
because people just dont want to hear it for fear of any obligation they may feel it creates we can all come up with various ideas on that front some more kind than others and of course something being selfevident doesnt mean its true it means were inclined to agree with it
the guardian has chosen to keep using the term how is that ok for the guardian to do but not for people on the right to do you inadvertently highlight the problem here there are plenty of gay people who use the word queer as a badge of pride as much as i sympathise with your feelings your argument suggests that whatever you say someone somewhere will always be offended this is why its important to have some tolerance in this area and to judge peoples words on the intentions behind them not on the meaning you choose to attribute to them

abi wilkinson a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps pervasive stereotype no map reading and navigation are fairly complex skills they do not just come naturally they have to be learned women are prone to anxiety around map reading and navigation because these are skills which many of them never learn instead they use a primitive and naive form of navigation which involves vague landmarks instead of street names and clear directions do you know where the bank is dealing with navigation matters with girlfriends and female relatives i have often been driven to apoplectic and exasperated rage but then hey on the other hand as a bloke i am rubbish at shopping the shop owners can see me coming from miles off but this is hardly surprising as i have simply never bothered to learn that particular set of skills

youre the one who doesnt get it this is not about hurt feelings its about the impact those words can have maybe to someone sitting at home behind a keyboard who probably never goes out in the actual word it seems like there is no impact there is imagine this you are going for a job you really want but the interviewing panel decide that you arent any good because you come from a social group which is continually denigrated and therefore as a member of that group you wont be able to handle the job how would you feel or try this you want to go to the shop but theres a bunch of hooligans outside hurling abuse and screaming that theyre going to kill you they refuse to leave for days and keep you awake at night with their chanting do you think well its just words nothing will happen to me

care to put a date on when in your view peoplepoliticians finally became able to challenge mass immigration albeit too late i suggest that as long as there has been mass migration there has been political discussion of mass migration i know churchill for example spoke a lot about his perception of dangers of immigration he used the nowdated term colour problems in the early s was that too late

i missed the part about professional trolls i guess you can not complain if both side using trolls it is hard to complain about the other team had better trolls you can not get too much out of it i had to think for a while to remember a good comment i think it goes like you can be a bigot but you can not act like one
except it isnt really a clash of ideas is it the likes of katie hopkins and germaine greer arent coming forward with some future idea to discuss and debate theyre trotting out tired old cliches that have been defeated hundreds of times before and i think we need to reminded yet again that refusing to host someones platform is not censorship and it most definitely is not restricting freedom of speech just because you have the right to thinksay what you like it doesnt mean that anyone has any responsibility to host it
universities tend to use the expression freedom of speech to accommodate religious extremism which insults gays women and anyone who does not believe in bizarre superstitious nonsense and the death penalty yet when someone like germine greer turns up a right not to be offended is used to clamp down on free speech they seriously need to justify why some people can be grossly offended on campus and others cannot be offended or even be put at risk of being offended of course simply not turning up to listen to germaine greer is not an option

im not so sure that populism would be the right term for what youre describing the reason the man was freed was obviously because there was no evidence to hold him and as a result of a concerted campaign led by but not limited to the daily mail his portion of the compensation presumably helped him start his life in the uk anew including his marriage and young family well probably never know whether he was always a terrorist or if his experiences in guantanamo or afterwards poisoned his life it doesnt make the decision to release him wrong obviously we live by the rule of law where crimes must be proven i dont hold you responsible for his subsequent crimes even though you argued for his release any more than i hold his religion to blame any more than i blame the various christian evangelical church for people killing doctors in america who perform abortions but i do find the hypocrisy of the daily mail and the total lack of competencies in terms of fact checking of the time line of responsibility disgusting
ah ah brilliant have a tick
micro aggression the attempt to equate language you disagree with or find offensive with actual violence thereby enabling you to justify the actual violence done to people you disagree with we saw this recently with the whole is it okay to punch a nazi debacle and the riots by students at uc berkley
the problem abi with this whole microaggressions malarkey is that once you start policing speech for offence its just a question of when not if said policing will be used to shut you down the freedom to offend which is at the heart of the concept of free speech not peripheral to it after all were not calls for emancipation from slavery or equal rights for women experienced as offensive when they were first made is paradoxically what keeps you safe to express all the intersectional bullcrap you like
it is not rightwing methodology and i do not say that as a defense of the right these tactics were always used by part of the left see the history of the soviet union and other revolutionary movements of the time they did not believe in free speech they either invented the techniques or adopted those invented by other totalitarians eg the nazis that is what george orwell which would fit to what we today call democratic left was railing against
but it doesnt the left have for a very long time used language to oppress look at the recent brexit debate and the left vitriol that anyone who voted for brexit let alone said there were issues with migration was instantly a racist and was fair game for any amount of insults and abuse
agree with the points youre making although that colbert remark was one of the funniest ive seen stephen colbert does a fantastic job of lampooning authoritythe president and is one of the genuinely funny of course humour is subjective people on american tv i think this paper goes particularly further down the rabbit hole in its presentation of the trump presidency where everything is deliberately presented negatively understanding it has an agenda is fine as when reading the daily mail but when that agenda is wilfully ignored it does lead to some real cognitive dissonance
not to disagree with any point you are making but the thing with peter tatchell was because a person refused to share a platform with him because they felt he was racist and transphobic not because of his views on the wedding cake thing i dont really know why they felt tatchell was racist or transphobic but that was the reason they gave

unless he was straight up saying here they are now go beat them up then as callous as it sounds yes i would because then you can then use what he did to say hey this guys an asshole maybe we should not give him attention just because he has free speech does not mean people are forced to listen to him the man thrives on being an asshole and as recent events have shown the consuquences of being an asshole are catching up to him and yes im prepared for the hate im gonna get for this comment because there was no way i could word this without sounding like an asshole myself
outrage culture begat the outrageousness of people like trump and yiannopolous predictably the outraged are outraged by this you all deserve each other
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening really can i suggest you look at the latest article by frances ryan and count the number of deleted comments are all these posters preaching hate or are some trying to engage in debate centred around personal responsibility and the need to defer consumption if buying now means possible poverty tomorrow sadly we are living in an overly censored world and the worst censors with huge irony are liberals the term liberal tyranny should be an oxymoron but it describes perfectly what is now happening think like us or dont express your opinion is increasingly the norm in liberal circles
though i think its important that dissenting speech should be formally protected i also tend to see efforts to make language more inclusive as a positive thing so as long as whats being said agrees with your thinking thats okay is it how any journalist worth his salt can agree with curbs on free speech makes me shudder
so you would be ok to be the subject of targeted humiliation in public on the basis of your accentskin colour for example because the guy doing it has a right
apparently its ok to insult offend marginalise and disparage white men as much as you like white men dont have feelings you see they dont have problems theyre privileged of course the suicide statistics tell a rather different storymen are three times more likely to kill themselves but the sort of people who write columns in british newspapers couldnt give a toss about that
but its the reported stats that get published

lets not pretend that just because the threats are too foul to publish in a newspaper that they are not criminal agreed a threat as i understand it however is considered legally to be an assault this would be the case even under the us first amendment i am referring to an opinion stacey for example did not issue threats he expressed a hateful and racist opinion i mightnt like his opinion you mightnt like his opinion generally speaking decent folk for want of a better term mightnt like his opinion but an opinion it was liam stacey went to prison for drunkenly expressing an opinion on twitter not issuing a threat
i am someone who is committed to social justice but i am also vehemently opposed to the desire to stop people speaking their minds we need to get over the idea that there is a clear line between offence and harm but unfortunately the world is not perfect so i cant help but suspect that the need to protect free speech will mean that we risk some harm to individuals because the damage to a society of going down the other route is much much worse as a white male who is aware of the social and economic advantages that come with this but would love to see a world where my daughters grow up without disadvantage i also have a warning if sjws keep demonising white males they will lose an essential ally as even those who are supportivesympathetic are alienated we need to find a way to attack the problem without blaming or seeming to blame an entire group im no more responsible for the behaviour of white males than you are responsible for the behaviour of all women or all black people etc if we keep defining groups like this we will lose the people
its called virtue signalling
exactly the overzealous push for censorship by the left is simply establishing a very dangerous precedent namely that conflicting opinions can and will not be tolerated shut down and no platformed i bet they think its all fine and well to be advocating this authoritarianism while its simply someone saying a trigger word or what theyve watered down to mean hate speech but the really scary times will happen if a hard right dictator finds themselves in power and begins purging dissenting opinions in the vein of what the current left is pushing for and we end up in a one party state which mind you would not surprise me in the slightest if these neoleftists would actually want theyre playing a really shortsighted and foolish game
whens the first bus to trappist this article finally tipped me over the edge
you just dont get it do you words do no physical harm we should not legislate for hurt feelings
of course what student unions choose to do on campus doesnt affect me directly as it has been some time since i was a student but it clearly affects students at the university in question not being allowed to invite speakers not being allowed to protest and leaflet and organise around an issue that matters to them that would seem to have a big impact albeit on a small population still just because it only affects a relatively small number doesnt mean we shouldnt think it is bad however the censorious approach is not just confined to universities there was an article in this very paper the other day about a campaign to shut down an art gallery due to an exhibition and set of speakers they had invited not a campaign against the ideas being put forward by the speakers but a campaign to shut down the gallery because they had invited them the premise behind this kind of action is underpinned by a world view that supposes people in general are weak and stupid and if exposed to these kinds of ideas they will fall helplessly under their spell that doesnt seem to me to be coming from a good place effectively that we are bad at arguing against the ideas so people should not be allowed to hear them
you cant do it that way because interpretation of emotional tone is subjective and whether or not it constitutes abuse is open to interpretation the increasing use of minority rights issues to liberal wash restrictions on freedoms of speech and indeed of thought is frightening to pretend that this is about the left standing up to right wing populist governments is a fig leaf the author of this articles suggestions are equally repressive and in some ways more insidious as they deny the speaker their rights by associating them by definition with right wing extremism if i was an abused wife for example would that give me a right to attack another man who triggers my past abuse with a perceived microaggression obviously not to encourage people from minorities to cast themselves as victims by definition and then allow them to use their perceived slights to bully others is a road that leads just as clearly to fascism as does the alt right route
oh god dont get me started on the beyoncé is a voice for the oppressed schtick thats been so prominent recently beyoncé who has been cocooned in the world of wealth and showbiz all her adult life yes she knows all about the problems faced by poor black women just like trump knows all about the problems faced by poor flyover state white people both are playing their audiences for suckers
ill ask you a second time could you please tell us what specifically made you come to the conclusion that you more intelligent and that your opinion is more worthy than many of those here on cif and most of the people in the uk
a male cosmonaught at a school talk was asked how he pooed in space so its not just women that would be asked that type of question
never yet met anyone who was against political correctness who had anything worthwhile to say on a subject fortunately you do not get to decide what is worthwhile and bar everyone who fails your worthiness test from speaking
irrational views is utterly subjective depends entirely on where you are standing perspective wise one mans irrational view is another womens common sense you dont own the rights to irrational view many may view your notions as irrational
there is a pull towards reason and justice the stoning of adulteresses thinking about it shouldnt we be using a gender neutral term like actresses are now called actors was rejected by christ  years ago there is no higher reasoning involved in declaring that say i can redefine my gender at will and you have to use my preferred gender pronoun on pain of legal sanction nor in discussing the relative merits of the cultures that islam has produced when compared with the west nor in any one of a thousand other things that you are trying to ring fence with this garbage
charismatic speakers like hitler convince people of the rightness of what theyre saying trumps charisma helped him get elected charisma is dangerous
i feel that people keep looking and picking over the extremes one persons experience is headlined stats get rolled out at all times that its getting worse in this day and age opinions are everywhere at the touch of a button the majority who use their own initiative to asses whether something is harmful or not or simply ignored are entitled to some leeway i have a brotherinlaw who insults me every time i see him i dont anymore as someone once said once you let go twice is coincidence three times is enemy action
just make sure you dont use the words swarm or liberation except in the narrowest of definitions
for the purposes of reporting there needs to be an objective element in order for someone to be convicted
youre assuming that because a person voted for donald trump they are among the loudest voices against political correctness while many of trumps admirers cite his unpc speech as a reason why they like him it doesnt follow that everyone who voted for trump fits into the antipc grouping or even that when someone talks about that grouping they mean trump voters as far as the point made in the article i would contend that the loudest voices who are largely wellpaid and welleducated journalists academics and politicians are absolutely class privileged at least as far as one would define that term
i dont think that follows you might not believe in the concept of microaggressions or think it matters much but raising it doesnt mean that one is frightened of what is said or done or cannot rebut it that could be the form of engaging and rebutting it it really depends upon how it is handled
universities are supposed to be where the ideas of the future are forgedbelieving in free speech means trusting people to defeat ideas in open debate if students cant handle the clash of ideas in a place as safe and cosy as their own campus how will they fare when they leave university or doesnt the guardian doesnt think students are up to it
i actually feel aggrieved to have heard of milo yiannopoulos and breitbart perhaps i need a safe space
rather unusually checking privilege is used here in precisely the correct context privilege isnt or certainly originally wasnt a statement about how lucky or guilty you are its a recognition of the effects of your environment and upbringing that shelter you from the effects of some discrimination and therefore stop you seeing it clearly for example as a white person in a white society whose skin colour has never been an issue for anything in my entire life i cant assess the effects of racism simply from my own experience in this case the male journalist recognises that the impact of being called guys is something that probably feels different from womens perspective than from his own so instead of just giving his own opinion on the subject hed better try asking some women thats all checking privilege means here
happy is your word not mine if you mean do i think that people should have the right to express their views freely in the language they choose even if i dont agree with them then yes i do with the usual exceptions slander inappropriate profanity shoutingfire in crowded theatre etc
i have to agree within the team fine from bosses not so much then again im a bit raw on this topic since i was part of an email chain at work  days ago that addressed me female and five guys as gents i have yet to reply since it patently isnt addressed to me although the subject is in fact an it system i administer and for which i am the change approver and for which they are seeking permission to change and for me to do the work incidentally its  i am sick of this shit
were all being homogenised help is homogenised sexist it sounds like it might be
are you a high court judge
i had no idea mate was gender specific this is the definition i followed chiefly british friend buddy often used as a familiar form of address
my female business partner calls all of our staff guys and addresses people of either gender as  darl i can just imagine what her reaction would be if i told her she was using noninclusive sexist language
the sort where we all have to sit through a mind numbing lecture on why the word guys is an oppressively misogynistic term then write an essay on why we are all bastards for using it
is finning another one of those practices that i have no idea about urban dictionary is your friend httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermsharkfinning
 gnats wing that is
there must be more pressing issues on which to spend video budget and guardian writers budgets
i dont think i could make it through a day working in the guardian office without offending someone do you all just refer to each other by your national insurance numbers for fear of being fired
ha ha i hope not felching was enough for me
meanwhile in the rest of the world people are dying of starvation treatable diseases warfare sleeping rough while were all discussing the ins and outs of a gnats sing
i work with a female engineer who when we are looking at assembly drawings refers to components as guys
i dont mind gals
the funny thing is hes not even telling you how to feel but you feel confident you represent every woman
hail humanity
and it really shouldnt be important to anyone im arguing for some perspective here the professionally outraged have over burdened us with utter trivialities its the modern day equivalent to theologians asking how many angels can dance on the end of a pin
its a very rare view point to find atl
why in the video is saying girls bad but bloke ok
the one i can never get used to is people calling members of the opposite sex mate it just never sounds right
because you get organs like the guardian preaching inclusiveness by dividing people into those who follow the correct rules and those who dont your contention is rather undermined by appearing under a guardian article about a lot of people including the author not being worried about using guys collectively
how do you know its a man i presume i shouldt assume mitch is gender specific
yo dude dont call me mate im not your mate i dont actually know you
heartily agree with your first paragraph as someone with a history background ive no issue with artshumanities grads per se idiocy stretches across all subjects from physics to media studies
i dont like it there is the whole you should be flattered to be thought of as honorary men thing about it i dont like the guardians use of actor for women for similar reasons btw acting is one of the few jobs where your appearance sex age etc do matter how about we switch to gals or girls for a mixedsex or male group in the very laidback mixed flatshares ive lived in it was usually just hey people
heatily agree with the first paragraph
feminism for gender equality the clue is in the word perhaps egalitarianism
and your pointless comment doesnt bother me either so i guess weve reached an impasse
one can only hope
make that you people plus those two
i dont mind being one of the guys so long as men dont mind being one of the gals
because you get organs like the guardian preaching inclusiveness by dividing people into those who follow the correct rules and those who dontthe hypocrisy is simultaneously breathtaking and a source of despair its also why arts graduates should never be put in positions of power they all seem to have an inner fascist obviously jk but i know theyll contrive to take me seriously
almost every woman i interviewed for this piece found the collective noun girls inappropriate you obviously didnt interview any women who play sport the use of girls in sport is far far more irritating than the usage of guys and what is more its use is incomprehensible being promulgated by sportswomen themselves its sexist demeaning childish and pathetic why on earth do they do it
its best to avoid words altogether i find a simple slap on the arse is a much better greeting
now thats not what i said
you sound delightful to work with
you misunderstand my comment was not intended generally it was directed solely at you why should i care if you know what i mean
the question feminists should be asking isnt why theyre talking like men they arent its why they can only express cool solidarity with other women by using prototypically male address terms arent there any female terms that would serve their purpose just as well but wouldnt using a female term to refer to a mixed group be equally problematic surely a gender neutral expression is whats needed if there is a need at all or if were talking about allfemale groupsmost women i know would probably use girls or perhaps in a joking context ruder alternatives
hay gurl haaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
is finning another one of those practices that i have no idea about
it makes sense when you think about it
people should be free use terms according to how they mean them not according to how the listener chooses to hear them and take offence at so you would be happy for people to use racist terms as they feel like and to convey the meaning they want
ive left my dignity in any number of pubs
i like that outstanding wanking there
excellent then there is weans
those are gender specific names which would perpetuate the patriarchy onto organisms which have both male and female reproductive parts so i prefer non gender specific names such as kim hilary and tracey
so if one is to carry on with this guys stuff why not as an alternative say gals just as non gender isnt it no you dont like it well how about you lotor everyone all of you lets bury that guy stuff once and for all
i believe girls is more employed in australia due to its over use in schools good morning class primarygood morning young ladies high schools very useful to show respect to students

youre right it is lovely and pretty usual to be honest depending on where you live men call other men and women and vice versa women to men love flower duck chuck dear darling hen and loads more i love it it helps keep our wonderful regional differences and dialects alive
i find walking into the office and saying sit down children really starts the day off right
actually youre conflating the use of guy in plural with the use of guys as a collective nounas a collective noun guys refers to a group of people sharing some sort of mateiness or common purposeas a plural it doesnt hence loads of guys in the womens toilets is very different to loads of the guys are in the womens toilets
would you refer to the guys on a womens netball team probably not but the guys on a mens netball team yes it is as gender neutral as referring to people as men just a bit more chummy douglas hofstadter wrote a great article and then part of a chapter of his book on translation le ton beau de marot which addresses this he es an aunt berating two kids squealing on a swing what are you guys a couple of girls which they actually were but to be accused of being a girl was the worst thing possible
why should i care if you know what i mean so you concede the point that people should be free use terms according to how they mean them not according to how the listener chooses to hear them and take offence at i must admit im disappointed to have got there so quick though if anything that was a bit too easy
ill vouchbut then my gender is not very specific and neither was theirs lovely guy though
just so you know david morrison was not actually asking you to give a dam though his house is quite nice he feels it just too impractical to try to squeeze in a very large very tall very heavy rather damp composite concrete reinforced structural steel compacted earth amp rock civil engineering structure with concomitant water volume amp aquatic occupants he tried one last week in his spare room but it didnt work out too well his front yards also unsuitable it already has a modest water feature hes quite happy for you to retain your dam maybe you could donate it to the nats
calling them guys what was the waitron thinking
the debate is stupid but to be fair the article does suggest an alternative in the very last sentence folks

how can a gay man who fins straight acting guys attractive be stigmatising feminism even the campest of gay men is a man not a woman so being attracted to feminine acting gay men is still being attracted to a man no slur on feminine humans is possible when the  people involved in the attraction of both men

almost every woman i interviewed for this piece found the collective noun girls inappropriate really you must know a very narrow range of women
a wordsatwork campaign launched by the australian diversity council what a time to be alive
i think it depends where you live in the uk its certainly what folk say here in shetland
i think there are far more important gender equality issues to focus on well you can say that again the article should have ended there really such as pay inequality eh not really there is no evidence that the supposed pay gap is caused by anything other than differing career choices surely everyone knows that by now
gentlefolk
it could be more offensive to women than men though and shower could be offensive to people who live in rainy places probably i would go with the much more universal you constellation of genitals
i had never thought about this that referring to people as girls would be irritating but then if someone were to refer to me as boy i would be pretty offended especially with the connotations surrounding it
now then bairns
why should i care if you know what i mean you are not exactly important and in any case as you dont care why people use words why would you want to know
yall brilliant undertones of gwb and his hapless antiterror campaign i dont think uk women would like that
ha ha ha oh dear
ive never used guys not only does it seem noninclusiveto me but its also american english when a collective term is appropriate i use the inclusive british english folk
which is of course how you end up with nonsense like students trying to get chaucer banned for use of the word niggardly as happened in a us college a few years ago it is neither practical nor desirable to reduce language down to only those words which do not cause selfdefined offence to anyone anywhere
i refer to my inlaws female cats as guys too hey guys want some dinnerthey do hiss at me though
if were going to stop using guys then we should also stop using mateerr why
oh dear thats me in trouble with my team then seriously it might depend where you come from or where your managers originally from to a northerner uk folks is pretty genderneutral and ageneutral id say but maybe it doesnt play so well so well in other parts of the ukive also called my southern female friends chaps and they dont mind a bit they just think im an eccentric old northerner saying guys just doesnt trip off the tongue partly because i think of it as a us thing and parlty because it sounds like im excruciatingly trying to get down with the kids
its only patronising if its meant to be patronising i see that australian of the year david morrison takes a very different view its not what you intend its how youre listened to
so feminists need to play nice and not say anything that people might not like
but its not what you intend its how youre listened to thats it in a nutshell
its an interesting example of language evolution over my lifetime growing up in the s and s guy was an american import which i remember finding awkward but its use did mark our generation out from using man which was hippy the worst thing you could possibly be in  it was a word which meant young man and its counterpart was woman never ever gal which would have been appallingly sexist pace jimmy saville later on finding it being used to refer to mixed gender groups i was at first resistant but then realised that it had found a linguistic niche which made it quite useful the guys and women phrase to refer to a mixed group had always sounded rather convoluted its use is amply demonstrated in the primary school i work in where whole classes are routinely addressed using it come on guys time to settle down is much preferable to come on children or come on boys and girls both of which sound patronising guys encourages them to think of themselves as young people it appeals to a maturity which may not be there but it encourages them to assume it thus reinforcing their agency creates cohesion and shows respect i think its incredibly useful ps its routine use in primary schools indicates that anyone who thinks that its new use can be resisted should wave a white flag right now
why
i did say any normal person
guys greet each other with hi ladies all the time at least some people di when i was back in ireland guten morgen madels
i have also been known to greet all male and mixed teams ive managed with a cheery morning ladies although in my case i meant it as a gendered insult which drew on negative feminine stereotypes to highlight the effeminate inefficiency of their work or did i 
i think jimmy savile has pretty much ruled that out as a form of address 
no but i agree with them so thats two of us ill leave you to do the global headcount
i was at a market in derbyshire last year and heard a male stall holder call a male customer flower i thought it was a bit weird but quite lovely
were proud of you
the internets opprobrium i would say
you was originally the plural form the singular secondperson pronoun in english was thoui suggest we should revert back to this just to prevent any confusion
manageress is a fantastically camp term with a sinister undertoneis she the woman who runs the launderette or is she the gangsterbossladybring back the manageress
les directeurs is not a good example they would normally be referred to as la direction even when all les directeurs are male
there are plenty of genderneutral or nouns captor sailor vendor
a few words of sanity in a world of pc it is quite settling to learn that the doctor is female when one hears their title is feminine just as it is to hear a female in the theatre is an actress as much as the pc brigade strive for a gender neutral world the facts of life are that people are either male or female and language should identify them as such
would you refer to the female director of a company as a manageress would you call margaret atwood a poetess
apparently gender dropped out of usage after the invasion of william the c in  in the half century it took to completely take control of the country the peasantry dropped all the genders and simplified the constructions as the nobility had been replaced and the new ones had better things to worry about then they had to adapt to the new style of speech basically the language got dumbed down by the common folk thank god
hahaha clever
viennot should be kicked out of the education system as she clearly has no understanding nor respect for the language idiot
read  les précieuses ridicules by molière mme viennot you are one of them
not even journalists can write their own mothertongue anymore whenever there is the possibility of a word having a feminine version they feel compelled to always write both and they talk like that too werte genossen und genossinen or they feel compelled to abbreviate their nonsense and write genossinnen with a capital inner i or genossinnen or genossinnen stuff like thata student used to be a student now it is a studierender or a studierende and so on ad nauseam in latin
gender slowly disappeared from the english language around the th century when vikings invaded many words common to both population except their endings to facilitate communication people dropped the gendered endings and neutered the language
on islands in the western atlantic ocean and in the pacific ocean people mf do speak french like that and englsh and spanish and dutch and 
that remark puzzled me too german was perhaps too difficult for him it may be a consolation to him to know that germans have to put a lot of effort too into learning their languagefew english speakers bother to speak their language correctly he said to my wife and i  if you were to correct the speaker you would get a blank stare as reaction
im all for simplfying but it should be elegant this is grotesque
you have a point for english someway somehow french inherited gender from latin german inherired  gender from who knows who english being a complex mix of old german and old french how the hell bloody britons dont you have almost any gender
ive just pointed out here that in german the word for testicle hode is feminine do you mean it can also be made masculine well i never
well by now with everything thats been happening lately kurz deals with libya coastguard trump afd etc i believe you could park an  wheeler in the graun butt they wont even notice 
 to do with sex in german the word for testicle is hode a feminie noun so no grammatical gender has little or nothing to do with sexbut on the subject of nouns i think it is impoverishing of english to call actors women who perform on stage or on televsision there is a perfectly good word for them actresses
oh i believe we should adapt to a nongender language just imagine a newborn in the hospital instead of the doctornurse saying congrats you are the fathermother of a wonderful boygirl they can just say congrats here it is your new human being
today we would probably use the title emperor for a woman yes but there arent currently any around are there there is a historical usage though and it makes sense to say empress if thats what is meant quite odd now to adopt the masculine form for empresses it seems
if you look what that genderconscious nonsense did to the german language like making the army feminine
do you often hear un bobard frivole crop up in conversation
both masculine as the word tantrum un caprice spanish feminine nouns keep their gender when imported in the french language une paëlla la paëlla whereas all english nouns take the masculine in the absence of gender
the académie française has always been a waste of time and a model of futility languages go their own way end of story
i wasnt expecting an answer but thanks quite different from the spanish i speak
examples yes studierende more common instead of studentinnen und studenteni havent seen politesse for female policeperson lately though that was faiintly charmingan editor recently told me that he couldnt be bothered with double designations as they take up far too much space in the lines of printthe main ones who really want to use the double forms are politicians who are afraid of being criticized over things which are not much to do with the policies they are talking about
are they an example please
turkish is a genderneutral language and of course we all know just how much more equal women are in turkish society than german society dont we
does it really have much to do with sex just as i was getting to grips with the basics of the french language as well
use of french is growing but not the académies version
yes i know but its used in order to be gender neutral now generally the masculine form of a profession is used that is why i thought i would write a comment is there an actual gender neutral version of actor today we would probably use the title emperor for a woman yes i guess people still say dukeduchess and princeprincess but all these titles are just historical dress up nowadays but who says ministress instead of minister
why have gendered nouns at all or gendered articles la and le could move on to the next vowel i and be replaced by gender neutral li wouldnt take much adjustment to alter the endings of say job titles to make them neutral directeuri li maire drop the letters unpronounced and half the language disappears anyway
murderess
in swedish the word human being is a woman en människa you use the personal pronoun she when talking about her hon
idiom for bullshit du nimporte quoior un bobard frivole
yes another exception would be the murderers and thieves never are they referenced in their feminine forms and while official institutions call students studierende now no self respecting nonfeminist student accepts this basically new clumsy expression and prefers studenten
we can multitask nestce pas
or should we call victoria the emperor of india
same in sweden i guess we have sjuksköterska which is nurse in swedish even if it is a man erska signals it is a female the male form would be are but sjukskötare is a completely different job so nurse is sjuksköterska
actor is not genderneutral its male like emperor
are you trying to tell us it was an actress
hellenic yes and sanskrit etc too its an indoeuropean thing
what would be the gender for frivolous bullshit in french
the english language has the words him and her yes and lets not change them to they or their for his and hers aaaargh
yep french do have passionate debates about their language which always surprise the anglo sphere language concerns all and has no class barrier attached to it unlike england
what did genderconscious nonsense do to the german language it meant having to say everthing twice die bürgerinnen und bürger die wählerinnen und wähler und so weiter but oddly enough not for everything eg i havent yet heard die fischerinnen und fischer try that in english i suppose one could say fisherfolk instead of fishermen though
good for the académie f those gyrations to avoid gender based language are so ridiculoous and tortuous germans are rowing back on it to some extent thank goddessness
inclusive writing is an aberration it reads like a dictionary entry étudiantes acteurtrices its complicated unnecessary i totally agree with the académie french inherited gender from latin french grammatical rules give the masculine form of a noun precedence over the female yet the use of the feminine form in job titles is very common nowadays another precedence that amuses students the use of the plural masculine subject pronoun ils overrules elles when one man comes aboard as in eight women and one man they ils instead of elles only women ps yes well known belgian marguerite yourcenar but lets mention another woman worthy académicienne assia djebar from maghreb
it does look quite bad when its written down doesnt it what is unusual is that in english the trend is opposite its more inclusive to refer to a group of men and women actors and actresses as actors or to refer to a woman as an actor rather than actress one gender neutral pronoun generally is used over a sexspecific one in order to be more inclusive rather than the other way around why is that
or madame la ministre both are correct
i want the capital h rule to homme inclusive of women we are all homo sapiens sapiens
la beauté cest dans la langue
if you look what that genderconscious nonsense did to the german language what did genderconscious nonsense do to the german language
tres bienvive la francela
did anyone else feel the guardian might have relaxed its house style for the headline to the story detailing the roving hands of ex president bush père they didnt it was ex president bush accused of sexual assauly by actor
it is not just the latin lings that have gender woven in check the hellenic tongue for example the english language has the words him and her and has been more open to change look where that language is now far more used the world over
dont forget all the special pronouns they will need to use for the lgbtqxiaah crowd which will be especially hilarious in french yes their civilisation collapsed because they diverted  of their time and effort to politically correct pronouns future archaeologist probably
another useless debate fueled by stubborn and pathological people when what is truly at stake is to stop so many men abusing subduing and beating poor women
for  years they have never stopped trying to torpedo any evolution of the french language towards equality viennot wrote only its not evolution if there is a politicised push from above to force everybody below to write or speak in a new pcway is it what next considering the amount of genders invented in rapid succession during the last years the french should probably embrace having to write directeurtricetesitreutexes soon
haha the relentless march of the dour political correctness mob has engaged with the formidable defenses of the latin languages which has gender woven into their very fibresdis goin b gud
sorry correction for the last sentence for all not really excluding half of humanity women un détail
lets mutilate the presence of women in the public arena instead a lot better and the best way to become obsolete for those of us who live most of their life in french speaking and writing it fixing the sexism reflected in the grammatical rules le masculin superscedes le féminin or in jobs titles is an act of love of the language the s of the académie have always been the arrièregarde farnbehind the changing reality for example they stick with les droits de lhomme to talk about human rights even when we are addressing les droits des femmes as human rights its has been decades we have been talking about les droits de la personne in the rest of the francophonie the s could try to clame the sanctity of the expression les droits de lhomme coming the revolution which was demanding equality for all for all for all not really ecluding except of humanity women un détail
the goal isnt noble feminists of the s and s where way cooler
im not surprised at all
bleeding académie française frances ultimate authority on the french language eh daring to emit an opinion about the french language good thing that the selfappointed politically correct thought police knows better
actually the solution is easy default to using the feminine version rather than the masculine version in mixed groups see how long it takes until they accept the mixed version for mixed groups not long
a national row really one academic who makes a living out of these ridiculous requests makes this a national row i suppose that the académie represents the overwhelming majority of the population in this issue
ah i cant say how much i enjoy it when the graun is having a severe butthurt keep it up france despite all the postmodern crap there still are bastions of common sense in europe
ikr one of the examples is like suggesting speakers in english address audiences as ladies and gentlemen instead of just gentlemen imagine the chaos
madame le ministre
only two
french is the fastest growing language in africa the continent with the fastest growing population there is little chance that it will become fossilized whatever the academy does
in this instance the reasoning of the académie française makes sense to me surely the noble goals of feminism can be accomplished without willfully mutilating a language logic aesthetic harmony and euphony need not be sacrificed
this article should come under fierce attack from anyone who is looking for journalism and not opinion piece dressed up as news
aberration is the right word if you look what that genderconscious nonsense did to the german language you can only congratulate the french on still having some sane people in charge
sometimes i love the french these suggestions are ludicrous
a good thing that there is no equivalent body for english any language needs to change with the times or risk becoming fossilised
yes it is a wonder many of ukips pronouncements were racist or do you think it ok for the party leader to warn people that they should watch out for neighbours from one group this brought back vivid and unpleasant memories of smethwick many of the things said by its candidates and members were racist do you think the insults and racism aimed chuka umunna earlier this week was just an infuriated backlash which just happened to be racist in tone the new pc is the lie that calling out racism is closing down debate
never gone on about ukip idiots or tory twats swivel eyed little englanders never called someone a fat prick
excellent point those decisions made the rise of political correctness possible not the other way around
i appreciate that my previous post did not make because of my potty mouth fair enough so i will try aagin in a more adultish tone what fabricant said was foolish in the extreme and is am own goal his intended victim whose own thoughts and meditations can well be blunt and insulting has come out of this better than he intended still saying all that in the throat lol
it seems that we are seeing a lot of what i would term reverse political correctness where those who hold unpleasant or dangerous views who are unreconstructed use the accusation of pc to suppress discussion andor criticism of their language
trying to sum up politcal correctness and the point of it is an utter waste of time that some people never tire of you have a  year old english girl who doesnt want a muslim teacher taing the piss out of her gay friend the muslim is then put in a position of having to moderate his language not by some mysterious marxist pc brigade from that there london but by a right wing english telegraph reading head teacher from dorset who is sick and tired of this particular muslim teacher upsetting the girls by saying things that are not acceptable in any mainstream school in the western world
why dont you print what he really said about jewsthats what the apology was for
are you asserting that the terms sexism and racism etc no longer have a valid meaning so what do we call what these terms describe because blatter can use the term racist do we just ignore it when someone uses one of these terms in a manner that we find awkward or should we actually take a look at what they are saying
homosexuality must strictly neither be contested nor even debated why would it ever need to be
wellyes and noin the same way that as you mention censoring language does not fundamentally change the opinions which led to the language being usedi contend that it is equally viable to use some of this prohibited vocabulary without actually holding the undesired perspectives reflected i would have to challenge the assumption that the use of these words is necessarily symptomatic of a deeper diseasei agree that the potential to offend is the fulcrumknow your audience know your audience know your audience
dont know why i repeated at the end of the dayshould use the preview button
political correctness didnt end jim crow in the us the us supreme court and dwight eisenhower ended jim crow
apparently its acceptable if you want to crucify someones career to use their utterances against them made while theyre tighter than a bishop
yeah i too guilty of used the fg word alot in reference to heteros mostly in the south of england and in particular to smug yet effete londoners which i guess would include g oldham
what really annoys the antipc types is not that they feel their free speech is compromised which is a fundamentally dishonest argument but rather that anyone dares to challenge them for saying those things or that there should ever be any social consequences so if anything it is their own position which is most hostile to the concept of free speech in its purest form as what annoys them is that other people use their own right of free speech to infringe on their sense of entitlement according to which they should be able to do or say virtually anything they want and should never ever have to suffer the grave indignity of being criticised for being an obnoxious jerk
i dont understand why there is  times more outrage if you are to call out somebody due to their religious beliefs instead of their nationality if you say to someoneyou are a fucking frenchgermanitalian etcthere is no genuine real outrage and they tend to laugh it off whywell simply because that person is actually okay with being what he is now on the other hand if you were to call someone a fucking christianthen again that ones okay see endless jokes about christianityjewmuslim etcaccusations of antisemitism rears its ugly head in an instant which makes you think who is the person more uncomfortable with reality you or the person taking offence alot of pcness is bullshit at the end of the day it gives power to certain people who at the end of the day deserve to be treated like everybody else in fact pcness sometimes blocks any kind of discussion on certain issues
i am superior to you in that i am more sensitive to the nuances of language and behaviouretc etc not only metaphorically superior but also she or he who has enough socialpoliticaleconomical power to shut you down and delineate the rightwrong permissibleforbidden discourse and its ensuing consequences ie who is an authorised and approved participant at the pc strongholds such as a tv debade and who are inadmissible at the pc sanctitude rites
you have the right to use words like fucking jew to my face and i then have the right to punch you in the face so your response to some words is physical violence tolerance would be better let them spout their nonsense and then tell them in no uncertain terms why they are wrong and a total moron
as a fairly well travelled person i find political correctness to be very much a fringe belief system primarily adhered to by a relatively significant percentage of members of a few western countries id be very surprised if these people made up as much as one tenth of the human race and probably a lot less thats not to say i think the world is full of crazy bigots but that the vast majority of the worlds population are shall we say unencumbered by the need to filter what comes out of their mouths britain is particularly big on this because of the ongoing trauma of postcolonial guilt that the left have particular affection for
it didnt
well that was interesting  mentions of pc of how it insists of how there is an agenda possibly a different one to the gay agenda how theres a pc lynch mob better than the real thing though i guess and then some excruciating diversion in to the emperors new clothes and then we learn that fgm isnt being confronted despite the mcgb only this week declaring it unislamic as i said interesting
without political correctness wed be back in the jim crow days or societally regressing to the bigoted attitudes shown by despotic medievalist and conservative authoritarian regimes where such bigotry is encouraged
only malebodied people are entitled to opinions or what on earth do you mean youre right i want to apologize for my thoughtless andwait doh well technically i was speaking to oldman and last time i checked my right hand will never be clean again he has balls
you know nothing absolutely nothing about the power of language if language didnt have such power we wouldnt be arguing about political correctness in language the funny thing is both sides are arguing the same thing that language has immense power to affect our power relationships its just that one side wants to moderate and modulate those relationships via language and the other wants to reassert them constantly apart from that its the same position language worksnow i dont know if you are a white guy but i will assume you are you dont carry a history of having pejorative language used to describe you i note you omitted the word nigger from your history of the language in one sentence funny that whiteoid gt whitey gt white gt english brit gt person of colordoes that work does that shed any light language moves on not because we are policed but because we know within ourselves that some language has passed on is no longer acceptable as slavery passed on as sending children up chimneys passed on as putting lepers in colonies passed on as locking lunatics up in asylums and going to gawk at them passed on language moves with the times as do our actions
but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone reality inverted today one cannot even criticise ideologies without being branded a bigot by some self righteous dogooding moron stephen fry stephen fry felt the wrath of this lunacy last year and look at other parts of europe such as sweden with its controlled media where free speech is being suppressed at every opportunity be nice to see an article about that in the guardian an article about a real liberal cause because theres nothing liberal about limiting free speech
thats a specious viewpoint wishing to maintain an ethnic culture something the pc brigade gladly supports for indigenous people ethnic minorities etc is turned into heinous racism when white people who are the indigenous peoples of great britain the danes want to maintain their ethnic danish culture they dont see why they should sell it out to the pc brigades endless mantra that multiculturalism is good for every nation everywhere all the time are the danes all racists for refusing to shred their national culture the way other countries have in service to a specious and rigid ideology do people whose families have been in dorset for  years have some moral obligation to relinquish their local identities because some guardian columnist whose family has been here less than  years wants a piece of it
be nice and people will be nice to you that doesnt follow you should be nice to people becuase you want to be nice not because you want them to be nice or so its been said here at cif
excellent article i watched the vile tory fabricant newsnight interview in disgust and severely felt like punching his misogynistic face
pcism although widely presented to be a pinko staple is foremost a neoliberal doctrine and social control apparatus yes absolutely
yes but most people with serious concerns about immigration are bigots and closet racists they just get upset about being told they are such because they lack the honesty to be upfront about it so you think anyone who has concerns about immigration is racist thenyou think its just about race and nothing to do with huge pressure on public services not a particularly clever view to have is it i bet youre one of those delusional unite against fascism people who goes round telling anyone who has different views to yours that theyre a bigot
of course language was used to demean people with afflictions it still is only now you get slapped down for trying to publicly humiliate the disabled and any other previously persecuted groups the fact is that your whing is that of a spolt brat who being prevented from torturing small animals decides to take this resentment out on the nearest available vulnerable group you obviously dont see the difference you claim that persecuted groups demanded a change in language but that isnt true yes it is all progress has been pushed through by those suffering worst under the status quo history is not made by sects in basements though they often try to reverfse it as with the sects in tabloid newsdesks perverting the languae oin an industrial scale the absurdity of your reactionary squeal is that this demonic plot you propose has had no effect on freedom of thought or discourse since the term pc was coined all it has done is throw some specific usages of a few derelict slurs on the bonfire and give bigots and racists less room to manouevre which was long overduie youll be saying next that to address an adult black man as boy is not offensive would you do that in new york say nothing offensive about the word boy surely who could object to that only someone whose identity is conditioned by the racism inherent in the use i can see you dont understand that either as for the damage done to the language by reactionary hatespeech lets take the desgtruction of another word for boy chav here is a perfectly inoffensive useful multipurpose word which was poisoned to print money pc doesnt make easy headline writing that is its only crime
i agree with this post gibsons father was a well known holocaust denier so there is some ugly family history here i doubt oldmans jabs were on quite the same level
all zionists are jews i dont think thats true at all there are a lot of fundamentalist christians who are zionists because they think that all jews must return to israel to fulfill a biblical prophecy
only if you are an idiot rightwinger cultural marxism is about the people having control of culture and not allowing either the state or a small number of influential people dictating culture you do understand that if you follow marx to the letter you end up with no state at all marx believed that to get rid of the state you needed it to first ensure that it took away the power of the wealthy elite you do know that libertarianism was actually leftwing and based on socialism its not that crackpot rightwing feeble minded version in the us
what he said people need to take a joke that racist and homophobic words dont matter thats what you and the article have said though youve not completely ed him yourself
theres many things i agree with in the article re pc but lola has taken what oldman actually said that much out of context the sun would be proud which is shameful really
i would stay up all night recommending your post
the way political correctness insists we skirt around particular words is bad enough as if the words themselves are somehow inately offensive which is ridiculous where afro americans have adopted nigger as a hypocoristic im not sure what actual benefit afro americans derived from the forced migration of the term negro to afro american beyond three redundant syllables but the political correctness agenda goes well beyond policing word usage its a platform for putting all cultural constructs on a level playing field where even manifestly inferior cultural practices are afforded equal respect this is for instance why there has been great reluctance to confront fgm for fear of branding from the pc lynch mob of being racist or why we see the contradictions of fundamentalist medieval belief systems with western values being constantly given a free pass the problem for politcal correctness is that public debate has moved on the pc emperor has been exposed of having no clothes it will never again have the power it once did to beat up on points of view it would rather silence than engage with
well said
the tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum in this instance two white rich powerful men whove done extremely well in the film industry i think its because they havent had to work everyday of their working lives for ordinary wages and a small pension after  years they now choose to work not for money but for status or prestige so they might not work for  or  years or they might take jobs on after they are pensioners just for the sheer hell of it pampered self absorbed theyve managed to work up a grievance out of nothing
im not making a point about anything it was a genuine question
i happen to agree with oldman on the pc front the truth is there wouldnt be so much rising resistance to political correctness if it hadnt conversely served served to cut off any opinion or dialogue that didnt hew to its rigid doctrinaire ideology discussions about immigration come to mind as a perfect example of an arena in which there was only one correct opinion despite the fact that it has been abundantly clear that many people in britain had been unhappy with the pace and level of such immigration for a long time those opinions have been condescended to jeered at the racist card pulled at every juncture the little england and kipper card and the bbc acknowledged refusing to air the publics ambivalences about immigration for fear of being called racist is it any wonder that an infuriated backlash arose
firstly in the dambusters the n word was the name of guy gibsons dog and the last time it was broadcast there were no cuts so you are factually incorrect in any case i think most reasonable people would consider it inappropriate today to name a dog the n word because it is black you are welcome to try and argue that such a state of affairs and the context of carol thatchers remark was that she referred to a black tennis player from france as that froggy golliwog guy again you are welcome to defend this finally you are of course to be congratulated on your ingenious wordplay but it falls down where anyone with a working knowledge of the language understands that being intolerant per se and tolerating absolutely everything are not the only options some things should not be tolerated thats not the same as being intolerant
agreed its like the term islamophobia so basically anyone who criticises islam must have some sort of phobia about the religion then i mean how insulting and patronizing is that all it is is a term designed to shut down any criticism of islam its one of the many reason why people think political correctnesses has gone too far and now its merely a form of censorship
living hell because thats exactly what happens not an exaggeration at all
if you honestly believe the differences between the sexes have been eliminated through language or otherwise youre living in a dreamworld of course i dont believe that nor did i claim it what i said was that pc language was an attempt to obscure these differences and delegitimise talking about them like all attempts to shut down the free discussion of ideas it is unworthy of respect and again i have no desire to demean anyone on the basis of their medical conditions race gender or sexual orientation what i insist on though is the right to discuss issues related to these areas in plain clear english with no restrictions on genuine exploration of the truth it is precisely this the limiting of the ability to openly and clearly explore the truth that is the true and intended purpose the pc project
yasmin ab says extremely hateful things about the white working class that would have her done for hate crimes if she chose to say the black working class she endlessly spreads antibritish nonsense whilst enjoying all the rights and freedoms britain provides her in contradistinction to amins uganda where she fled from and the subcontinent where she chose not to go hypocritical nonsense notice too that when appalling crimes are committed she says nothing but goes bananas when rod liddle et al say unpc things about them ie liddles language offends her far more than brutal violent crimes i agree fabricant was a fool for saying what he did and would never condone it but lets not lose sight of yabs appallingly offensive record too
political correctness is a straw concept used on the right to blame the left for their feelings of discomfort about using bigoted language in a social milieu that no longer accepts it no ones policing their language its just one more scene in their conservative oppreshun passion play someone can say any slur they like as far as im concerned it gives me excellent fair warning as to what sort of person they are and i can act accordingly
thats actually a big difference between dialects of english in american english cunt as an insult is gendered female in british english its genderneutral and in australian english its gendered male the macquarie dictionary defines it as a despicable man
that is insane nobody commes out with an antisemitic or racist diatribe as blockegt one drunken mistakemore like they speak honestly when drunk or angry but cant face that its unacceptable
oh come on this is the guardian those questions will make their heads explode
yes but most people with serious concerns about immigration are bigots and closet racists they just get upset about being told they are such because they lack the honesty to be upfront about it its like that old mantra im not a racist but always to be followed by a load ofracism people are sensitive about the word they feel its bad but nevertheless still hold the actual beliefs that lie behind it its as if they feel the malice is somehow confined to the word itself and not the emotion that it describes be out and proud and honest by the way what the hell has health and safety got to do with it has someone suggested youre racist for using a broken ladder lately or are you just trying to cover every dumb cliche in one go
yes that is a problem i dont think though its an integral part of pc but rather the worst excesses of it or a misuse of it like anything its not always going to be without problem or misuse what i have noticed though is that its often but not exclusively from notional supporters rather than the minority themselves that go in for the kill about this that said its a balance for instance from a gay perspective being called a fag or poof or hearing someone use the word gay as a slur isnt as bad as being beaten up or losing a job through discrimination at the same time id like to feel that if i heard someone use it i could object without it being seen as attempting to police their language for that reason i will try to listen when its something that directly concerns them and they object
a favourite of mine was from laos it translated as russian ladybottom so i learned the laos for not russian not american not french im english and everyone was fine again
the tide is turning greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum in some cases sadly it is because they do not believe in greater equality or human rights
i personally do not think the c word or the d word are inherently sexist unlike the n word but i really do wish people would stop glossing over racist diatribes as poorly expressed the guy expressed himself exactly as he meant to as a miserable guttersnipe the best thing we can say about gary oldman is that his low intelligence means that he has a dreadful paucity of language such that when he wants to insult someone his brain is only able to reach for the nearest slur rather than articulating something a bit more specific or heaven forbid creative the less sympathetic view is that when he disagrees with someone he sees that disagreement as inherently due to their inferior characteristics of race gender or homosexuality
most people dont thats why what he said was so ridiculous
i dont much mind the pc brigades efforts when theyre tinged with sanity mostly theyre not and here are just two of them first a word in itself cannot be racist or sexist or anything else unless it is in a context that makes it unacceptable for this reason dubbing the codeword for the successful  dambusters raid with something else in a film made  years ago is just stupid it was n i g g e r incidentally similarly the bbc ejected carol thatcher because she used the goiwog word no context needed instant expulsion secondly the pc brigade dont seem to understand the delicious irony of their mantra intolerance will not be tolerated
surpluspop was banned for his ridiculous post but d michael rivas wasnt why maybe his elaborate jewish conspiracy theory was just articulated better
 greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right quite why this should leave so many seething and feeling victimised is a conundrum you could start to unravel your conundrum by considering these questions a look up and ponder the meaning of the word equality how can there be a greater or lesser amount of equality b who grants this right to greater equality and how do they do it
whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense pc language is widely viewed as an encroachment on individual freedom in this sense the persistent rightwing offensive on the concept has won out plain wrong pcism although widely presented to be a pinko staple is foremost a neoliberal doctrine and social control apparatus the identity discourse and its ensuing policy runs against class consciousness or even against social policies such as the universal welfare state in practice by elevating some identities to be deities does the writer really believe that a nigerian person is offended being called the n word which is identical with herhis nationalityidentity would mrs lola okolosies oversensitiveness towards antisemitism extend to include muslims the pc army signals out less strong and connected groups or if it is a must identities bashing muslim preachers or describing she or he you do not agree with as terrorist is allowed since these are not a part of the cuddling pets of the pc arm of the identity politics hq homosexuality must strictly neither be contested nor even debated yet scroungers skivers or endorsing policies that expel people due to origin ethnicity roma or certain immigrants generally are perfectly kosher not the forbidden halal of course in short the identity politics and its ensuing discourse have nothing to do with the political left moreover disguising its political struggle under the pretext of a certified or an imprimatur language proves mainly its enormous social power and capital its disregard to leftist values such as universalism or equality its political ends by hugging certain identities while objecting others furthermore the pc police are the foot soldiers of the well off middle class neoliberal who try to disguise their struggle with their opponents behind a superior moral values to muddle its real will to more power and influence
the sad part is the guardianistas actually view orwell as a culture hero despite invoking many of the tactics of the totalitarian government orwell created there are so many real problems to solve and going after guys like gibson and oldman no matter how odious their beliefs may be strikes me as at the very least utterly pointless and at worst an attempt to browbeat people
the sole point about political correctness is that in effect you are saying to others look i am more sensitive than you are i am more civilised more sophisticated am capable of more sympathy and kindness more analytical empathy i am superior to you in that i am more sensitive to the nuances of language and behaviouretc etc its now very common to hear people say im rather offended by that as if that gives them certain rights its actually nothing moreits simply a whine its no more than a whine i find that offensive it has no meaning it has no purpose it has no reason to be respected as a phrase i am offended by that well so fucking what stephen fry
i think that its important to differentiate between hate speech and irony mr g oldman may have been taking the mickey a little in his mimicking of what happened to m gibson after his outbursts i worry that m gibson meant what he said but in the case of oldman this is irony and description thus its probably fair to say that he should not be chastised in the same way that m gibson more rightly was brought to task
i thought a road safety officer was part of the police force gah yearns for the s
and should not be taken as some political point why not because you say so you seriously think four eyes has the same history and implications as the nword wow
what never seems to be acknowledged in these arguments is that there are two distinct elements involved  holding a morally questionable andor discriminatory opinion people being offended by that opinion censoring offensive language may go some way to solving the second of these problems but does nothing to fundamentally change the opinions which led to the language being used in the first place the words are merely symptoms of a deeper disease they need treating but until a cure is found they will just keep coming back
grins
i guess none of the guardian writers have ever read george orwell and those of us who have can only but weep
well he also suggested that what mel gibson and alec baldwin said was what we all say most people complaining about the politically correct brigade seems to have neglected that little tidbit yes thank you gary cannot hide behind me on this one im afraid i do not do what he suggests
thank you that was niggling me too
thats one of my favorite lee es his story about the guy getting upset at muslim women at an exercise class is great too its political correctness gone mad stew
who are you arguing withwho said youll never hear a black man or jew making jokes about other races i dont think ive ever heard anyone say such a thing if you want to be passiveaggressive you should at least make it slightly clearer who you are being passiveaggressive to
yup good manners are simply good manners but what happens with pc is that it goes beyond good manners its about control of languagea as a form of thoughtpolicingb as you say here a lazy way of pretending to be an activist or ally when really its just flattering the ego and spoiling for a fight a substitute for actually doing anything about injustices as i said ive seen a lot of stupidity about language policing on disability issues when people are facing benefit cuts and atos and other crap that is killing people its poor priorities but as you say it allows people to bask in selfrighteousness and selfappointed superiority even though it does nothing to help in real terms telling someone you cant say someone suffers from x condition the word suffers is unpc does nothing to help and may be in complete denial of the fact that the person in question is actually suffering that fact doesnt change just because you are not allowed to use to word
well thats one i did notice however that most of them arent in english
but that means that you are intolerant yourself you cant see the difference between being intolerant of ethnic minorities and being intolerant of intolerance
why the hell do people persist in interviewing actors anyway what do they expectthe definition of an actor is someone who needs someone else to tell them exactly what to say theyre sonorous echochambers an interview with one is nearly always a wholly thankless waste of everbodys time and yet no other group of people are interviewed more often
what has really happened is that people have become sick and tired of the pc brigade using racism bigot and all the other terms as ways to beat into submission those with genuine concerns about immigration muslims etc along with the health and safety crowd its used as an excuse to do nothing or to simply censor anyone who doesnt go along with the political views at the time hence you get people like gordon brown calling an old woman a bigot because she felt uneasy at the amount of foreigners arriving herefreedom especially of speech is a two way street and its always going to upset someone
yes i doif we are talking about dick and women sometimes tohow very gender prochoice of meand sometimes i call mencunts also so you see we really have gone full circle
i didnt know free speech was a rubric i took it as a foundation of liberal democracy
no he retweeted it stupid yes but he didnt actually say it
language was used to demean people with afflictions which were not medically understood or culturally tolerated the perennial and pointless assertion of the pc pedant of course language was used to demean people with afflictions it still is pc hasnt and cannot change that indeed it has made it easier for someone who wants to demean someone else by multiplying the offensive power of words we are not supposed to use negrogtblackgtafrican americangtperson of color negro was never an offensive word martin luther king used it himself in his famous speeches but the pc brigade have made it so they will probably want to censor kings i have a dream speech next crippledgthandicappedgt disabledgtother abled do you really think anything is achieved by this endless chain of euphemisms there was never anything intrinsically demeaning in the word cripple but by insisting we use a euphemism the pc brigade are actually saying that being crippled isdemeaning i will not subscribe to that insult you claim that persecuted groups demanded a change in language but that isnt true all that happened is that a small number of people inside and out of these groups saw a way of getting political notoriety by pushing these issues
i dont think it is cognitive dissonance as our language and behaviour has become externally policed so has what used be considered good manners declined what was a personal quality politeness became seen as political poliical correctness i dont think it really helped anything
comedy is not language designed to construct reality its language designed to tease out of us what makes us anxious in reality laughter is an adaption its what happens when our anxiety is unwarranted false alarm were all bread to be hyperactively anxious towards issues ongenderrace etc comedy teases our anxieties about these issues to generate laughter
forbid as in you will get censored or even your life will be made a living hell
david niven was brought up in a different era so of course it would not apply i have read the full report of what gary oldman was trying to say and he as far as i can see was pointing out the sheer hypocrisy of the pc brigadehe was only saying what the majority of us think you can not demand respect it has to be earned bringing in laws to say otherwise only makes people hold those laws in contempt whingeing about the world owes you this and that is a sure fire route for lack of respect
no free society has to tolerate the intolerant but that means that you are intolerant yourself
oh i wasnt saying you were wrong i was just pointing out the nonsense of people saying political correctness gone mad when all thats required of them is to treat other people with respect
cultural marxism is actually closer to a libertarian view of what culture should be cultural marxism is vernacular shorthand for the power prejudice mindset the view that women cant be sexist only white people can be racist etc theres nothing remotely libertarian about it
the first paragraph of this article takes every single e out of context to make it look as dreadful as possible reminds me of those theatre es where the review says this play is crass and useless on every conceivable level despite a formidable performance from x who tries and fails to rescue it from artistic oblivion and the poster says a formidable perfomance from x

amazing the concept of a truly accidental fart i mean or is it just my arsehole that doesnt behave like that and provides me with a clear option of pushing it out or holding it in rather than just expelling itself of its own accord indeed my orifice also provides further finetuning sub options such as push out loudly and proudly or slip out quietly sneakily even the option to let out a little taster so to speak for further evaluation and then a secondary decision as to whether to proceed or hold

i am a very proud yorkshireman and regularly use the word love when talking to women if any women asked me not to call her that then would respect her wishes and not use it while speaking to herhaving said that in the  years i have called women love nobody has ever been offended by it and asked me not to say it

i think passive aggressive offencetaking should be recognised as a form of abusive behaviour its rife in the uk these days people offended before you even open your mouth you get warnings in public places now offensive behaviour will be prosecuted you havent even said anything and theyre threatening you im offended by that so in short i hate this nonsense
i really dont see how calling someone a girl is bad in any way that calling someone a boy isnt workplace context or not

oh come on theyre being nice i think hun is kind of charming unless said in a patronising voice of course at which point it becomes the most annoying word in the world that doesnt end in splaining
this should be considered a semantic problem before a feminist one and in that respect the author seems to be straying out of their depth its probably a pretty complicated and loaded topic even for linguists and sociologists better to try and understand people and holistic behaviour while you are with them rather than dissecting their likely nebulous use of individual words in hindsight its analysis paralysis which is looking like an inherent intellectual problem for millennials which i can attest to being just under 
i suppose you no longer go on a girls night out you know maybe its a metaphor rather than supposed to be taken literally my sister mum and aunt went on a girls day out champers on the roof of john lewis and a nice meal somewhere they must have hated it if only they hadnt referred to themselves as girls when none of them are a day under 
the one thing ive noticed about all the newspaper articles that have appeared recently on the subject of harassment and language is that at some point these focus on the age of the actual or imagined perpetrator the one stereotype that connects all these contributions is that of the old man does this mean that attentions of young men are ok andor that younger men are somehow more attuned to female sensitivities or this just as much an ageist as it is a feminist issue
indeed the voices of those first brave victims have now been completely drowned out by pointless feminist semantics
this article is doing a big disservice to the important issues of sexism male dominance etc just this week i have been addressed as love my love and darling this by young or youngish females while i am a very mature male it seems amusing to me if anything
thats alright im fairly selective too
i thought the idea was that we shouldnt take offence when people address us with informal terms

agreed hun is the worst whatever sex you are
yes i agree context is key which obviously includes class age and regional culture i think it ok for very elderly people to use informal terms that people may object to their peers or younger people using i dont think many professional younger women would resent a man in his s calling them dear sweetheart or love even in a doctorpatient type relationship with the woman being the doctor but they might not want to hear it from a peer and certainly not a fellow professional which i can understand the issue is different for women because they so often struggle to be taken seriously
i have now reached an age at which my genuine absentminded reference to women i know well and much younger women who are often friends of my children and whose names i have forgotten as darling is taken for precisely the friendly and reassuring greeting intended of course i know the problems but i think most people can judge the intention by the tone and body language of the user
i hate this nonsense
that use of ladies wouldnt have gone down well in an all boys comp
i think youve hit the nail on the head if a guy selling me stuff in the market says love or sweetheart it doesnt matter however if my boss calls me sweetheart or love that is definitely an im putting you in your place title
my dad was born as bred in derry as was my mother and he called her wee girl all his life
hang on a minute can i also object to being called babe hon or the latest incarnation presch by women i am a middle aged man with a taste for beer i am neither a babe a hon and i am most definitely not precious no matter how many times the female till operators at the supermarket try to tell me i am it really really pisses me off
while teaching i used ladies regardless of their age girls always made me think of st trinians they used guys to each other when talking in groups i copied it after a while and it seemed to be ok
what if its a gay strip club
you certainly have a right not to be referred to as girl if you wish but by what right are you precluding other women from that term who dont mind it
 of the time when someone says love darling etc no malice is intended this rises closer to  of the time when someone says boys or girls however i suspect malice is very much intended virtually every time people take choose to take offence at these terms
how rude there are so many out there who wish take offence because they consider themselves to be partentities multientities or of course nonentities 
that is unusual
and your point is
times have changedsome like to be called shirley
love the ting tings 
ah so you are a young person and dont call him mate
thats the one we live in
context is everything
wasssheonaboutso it goes
a south african coastal city
you can always take offence retrospectively for publicity in the newspapers
thanks for articulating something that bothers me too i am a woman have been since i was  in a work context i find it insulting to be called a girl this is because of the way it reinforces stereotypes and the power differential i dont object to my friends calling me anything they want i love being called petal by the barrista at my local cafe
i like girls
how would the author react to being referred to by friendly people as my lover in cornwall duck in the midlands or hen in scotland
up until the last month ive been living in a lincolnshire mod house some of the houses had been sold off so there were civilians and military living side by side while walking my dog i would normally get a greeting of some sort accompanied by being looked in the eye as i believe is normal when speaking to a fellow human being unless my husband was with me and then i received nothing as if i didnt exist this i find appalling behaviour as im not his property i am a person
im old enough now that i can refer to all all totty as sweatheart
when i was a little girl my mother wouldnt let me play with prams and dolls so i would avoid being brainwashed this was in the s i am so glad her plan didnt work as my three children have given me by far the most satisfaction in my life however i do what most would consider to be a mans job anyone can call me girl princess love i dont care it doesnt say anything about me it says something about them in the uk there is nothing holding women back except women themselves also in living memory one of my dear friends was turned away from a bed and breakfast in blackpool because he was black the owner was quite clear on that and so off he went one of my relatives who is gay and grew up in the seventies was unable to tell anyone he was gay until he was in his forties in comparison to that being called love once in a blue moon is hardly traumatic cant we girls just be amused rather than offended by these terms of endearment the younger generations dont really do it anyway so its as if we are getting righteously offended while we still have the chance to before we run out of time
terms of endearment please this is trivial in light of what has been going on rape forcible confinement gross indecency that is the kind of stuff we have several hollywood figures accused of these are quite simply violent crimes not harassment or careless language arent you writing about a scratch when we have gaping wounds
gendered power differentials im pretty sure women can pronounce the word girl too
do they have to stand up when you come in the room
or being a guy called guy
any meeting thats addressed by managers as guys should in fairness be addressed as dolls the next time
dark like black black black blaak
i still dont want to get into a mindset where i cut myself off from saying according to this girl im friends with or whatever to casual acquaintances im actually pretty close to that mindset as it is as i move in pretty liberal circles
excuse me
some people carry that look off very nicely
im very selective in my choice of words i get the feeling i wouldnt even acknowledge you if i met you sorry
blibble
and im not your lady 
its not nice its dark
mate mate im not your mate sniff
context is king lets say with people who know you well where theres no mistake about the intent then its ok
its all very well adding a  to your name but you are fooling noone time on your hands eh
if its the only way women are referred to its a problem its a knotty problem too it is potentially dismissive and patronising but equally girl love etc are also terms used naturally without any intentional loading in many parts of the country maybe less so in middle class circles perhaps in norfolk as a man if i shop somewhere like the market in norwich being called my darling moi dahlin by women who work some of the stalls is a nice part of the day thank yuh mdahlin its lovely to hear the men tend to say my man or boy the latter being more familiar and could be offensive if used out of turn
or broad
its only just begun the twitterati have only just discovered their power to extract apologies and precipitate punishments for almost anything they begin to shriek about
almost seems like a psychological outlet to me
misandrism everywhere poor blokes im hoping they wont mind me calling them that had to really think before commenting on this because as a woman i dont really want to be associated with it in any way
i can assure you that the middleaged women in my office still refer to each other as girls but ive not heard a man use it about them
im not on a pc smartphone mate its 
yes and then we can look forward to many more teachers being suspended or sacked or otherwise hung out to dry because they used a term of address that has lasted thousands of years before suddenly becoming taboo because of  smallminded cretins on twitter this stuff is dangerous be careful anyone can find themselves victims of hate these days no matter ho ardently you aspire to the pc standard now even germaine greer is not permitted to speak her mind
irate most of this is people taking the piss out of the pc gone mad duffers or just having a laugh unconnected to rebeccas article which is nice enough if a little anodyne
because thats the american usage as a student in london in the s i remember being irked by us school girls we had groups stay in our halls during the summer refer to each other as guys inevitably it made its way here years later
im also offended when people use my name to call me by i find that given my frame of mind sometimes it jars against my subconscious gender i wish people would start to refer to me as oh great nonsexed ruler of the potato people
the most derogatory comments ive had have been from other women if a man calls me a tart hes just inaccurate if a woman calls me a skinny bitch theres something nastier at work here in devon good luck with the vernacular lover and my andsome which is quite charming from either sex
censorship below the line here is noticeable by its absence this is very encouraging to see hopefully a sign that a corner has been turned
comments here will close shortly many thanks for your contributions
i was there too and it just is true and to my mind a very valuable attitude misogynists love establishing rules about the differences between men and women as they can provide all sorts of useful reasons to continue to exclude women in various ways and preserve great chunks of experience for men only but divide up humans in any way even ability to bear children and both sides will contain men and women both when west point academy was investigated after the first female recruits emerged more dead than alive it was concluded not that the institution was antifemale but that it was inhumane the men were suffering just as much
yes because if someone says something is good or bad its totally unclear whether thats their opinion unless they tell you next time someone tells me this cheesecake is really good i will shout in your opinion
they is specifically used when youre talking about an unknown person or a hypothetical person who could be either gender the old way to do this was to say he which is pretty sexist to avoid that you have to say they or end up with really uncomfortable phrasing like he or she will worry about which pronoun she or he should use when he or she meets her or his friends
unless of course youre american in which case fanny is your arse indeed but she specified british english
there i agree less every time ive seen mansplain actually used its meant you are a man and i am a woman you have disagreed with me therefore you are a bad person and should be ashamed of yourself but see above re this not trumping constant casual sexism that tends to assume men must be in positions of authority
no i think theyre different issues we have a history of using words that shame women sexually slut slag even bimbo to an extent male shaming tends more towards suggesting youre insufficiently manly man up and so on gendered language has been an issue forever its generally harmed women more insults are less important than the way we tend to say he to refer to a hypothetical person in any role that doesnt involve parenthood or housekeeping my objections to mansplain are completely separate from this i apologise if i created the impression i was saying this term outweighs other uses of language against women it doesnt i just cant stand hypocrisy and people who talk about mansplaining typically tend to claim theyre opposed to sexism even as they use a sexist epithet to try to shame men into silence i fully accept that this is a pet peeve of mine not a huge social issue
the person using the word mansplaining is very often the victim of the mansplaining behaviour as it very often demonstrates the disrespect for women and their knowledge and is an active attempt tt to put the woman in their place ie inferior to men
seriously i had no idea i have to say i like that version better
so all the decades ive been exposed to gendered language demeaning women the casual everyday sexist language the people using that language were consciously promoting sexismor it it more that now there are some commonuse words describing men in less that positive terms gendered language becomes an issue
perhaps we should have another word for mansplaininghow about patronising or does thats etymology come from patron which stems from paternalisnt our language already full of these words their exact usage changes and over time they lose their single sex connotations or they drift in and out of usage there is a distinct possibility that words such as manflu will become just a cold that is being over egged for all people women will be guilty of mansplaining and a sheo will become a boss who isnt all blokey and testosterone fuelled regardless of their chromosomeslanguage is about communication and as long as both parties get the meaning does it matter that much if its originally a male or female term
well if shed shown you her fanny it certainly wouldnt have been her vagina that you saw brief lesson in female biology required
maybe its a shame you said that without adding in my opinion in my opinion
true true and i believe prior to these meanings it was an innocent shortening of frances
it can be childishly amusing for british people watching american tvfilms when the word is used
im american and i had no idea that fanny was used to mean py
toilet loo wc public convenience or probably totally challenging in the current genderbattle era gents and ladies a bathroom in the uk has a toilet a sink and a bath and perhaps a shower or bidet too all together in the same roomeuphemisms are also possible like cloakroom and theres the craziest restroom where there is no bed or sofa
there is two creation tales in genesis one of them says male and female he created them
fanny is the gold standard by which all other names are measured
seashell concha is slang for vagina in spanish too
patriarchy is misleading since it seems to imply the possibility somewhere in some time of a matriarchy which never existed anywhere on this planet since the dawn of mankind no more than among apes and very seldom among mammals
very confusing for foreigners the first time i happened to meet it in a us feminist blog i thought first that my sight was worse than i knew it to be and then that it was a mere mistyping i cant get used to it why for gods sake have now he or she become inconvenient this from a person me who has always felt somehow androgynous
the female version of willy is flower or is that just a scottish thing
its a shame you said that because it was actually a very good article for once
i just read the first paragraph of this and i thought ive never ever heard anybody in the real world ever use any of those terms because you just need to hear any them once to know that the person using them is by definition a complete twathead or any genderfree equivalent you prefer
foof
very nice thanks for the reminder your ever faithful mr pego
ok take a deep breath what is wrong with plain english words like penis and vagina just ask any group of young women or girls what they call it and you will get just as many euphemisms for vagina as men or boys have for penis my teenage grandaughters have settled on hoohoo im not sure about the spelling
i think i may have made the mistake of telling her i was a good listener once the lengths some will go to in order to find love bow your head in shame
foof or pandoras box if you want an interesting conversation
woooooooooooooooosh extra big woosh for you no i think i understood the point the author is asserting that men can be shamed by accusations of manwhatevering i disagree with that point no amount of calling me a manterrupter or mansplainer would shame me in the slightest

allow me to womansplain the problem with gendered language never trust an article that feels the need to start with its own ironically referenced get out clause
what i hear commonly in thailand is chang noi baby elephant and hoy seashell works for them
in our house its mrs b who does all the mansplaining now theres a gender conundrum that takes some womansplaining
i think dislike and contempt for modern feminism is a little more widespread than you think often among women who have woken up and realised that men are not in fact to blame for everything
i sympathise hard to win these days whoever you vote for its increasingly a choice between a front bottom and an arse hole
it really doesnt matter we need jobs
good point we should aim for a more general phrase which applies to either case which rules out shaven haven i suppose sideways smile would fit here rather nicely sorry bit of an unintentional double entendre there 
my parents always used bits for both boys and girls nongendered they were clearly way ahead of the curve
switzerland 
to be fair it does say widely used but i reckon fanny fits the description
all to your credit my friend professional offencetakers are everywhere these days and not that it matters a jot but im white well actually ive never been that white must have been a naughty spaniard in the family somewhere no reference to them on ancestrycouk though and these days thanks to an increasingly uneven distribution of melanin im like a patchwork of all shades of pink and what mrs bs interior designer refers to as neutral tones when hes trying to add a few hundred quid to the soft furnishings bill
to me lady garden is only really applicable once theres grass on the pitch
well if confirmation bias is based upon consistent evidence that was one example of many then yes
she even talks in her sleep theres a song about this
gay could be used for a woman too but lesbian cant for a man so the commenter is correct
if a singular they is good enough for shakespeare its good enough for me
um so very sorry to disagree but here in rural lincolnshire my female friends do actually use that word often to men in the pub nice of you to explain to everyone that isnt the case though
huh i guess we need a new pronoun for fannybaws now
fud is probably a bit too rude
yeah agreed lady garden sounds wellmanicured amp fragrant
i e ms ruth davidson thats the difference between our two parties labour is still fumbling with its flies while the tories are enjoying their postcoital cigarette after withdrawing our massive johnson
i think ill wooooosh myself
john thomas was and still is by older men quite widely used but i dont think lady jane caught on so to speak
i still giggle when i recall how herstory foundered on the rock of hersterical in punch mag
i dont think sexists get less sexist they just use the language more carefully they say woman but think girl like the racists james baldwin referred to decades ago as saying negro and thinking nigger i think pc has its place in written language particularly in newspapers but writers always find an excuse to express themselves in streettalk the irony here is that this newspaper which has spearheaded the practice of examining and parsing every phrase using a style guide to pre and proscribe publishes anglosaxon filth regularly far more than any other newspaper and i have always been of the opinion that is the outlet and a sub or even unconscious railing against the pc that must otherwise inform their prose
youre the one who loves making sweeping unsubstantiated negative comments about people why dont you offer us the benefit of your experience
i like lady garden just because it sounds so prim and proper ive also heard foofoo
and as for  british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina i can think of several but will mention only trumps favourite word for that both maligned and worshipped organ pussy is not a nonsexual usage of the word i refer you to the very comments by trump that you mention fanny is though its basically equivalent to willy
it says that british english lacks an equivalent word though which fanny is
theres something about this article that suggests that the writer really means english language when she writes language occasionally means sex when she says gender though not always though most of the times he uses gender correctly ironically unlike almost all her guardian colleagues and has not studied inflected including gendered as english is not languages into which category most european languages fall the words she uses at examples of gendered language are used only in social media blogs other such trivia they are not in general use nor could ever be they are ephemeral and as for  british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina i can think of several but will mention only trumps favourite word for that both maligned and worshipped organ i did not know that jane austen used they as a neutral pronoun and if this adds legitimacy to the usage good for both of them a writer i used to like david lindsey once attempted to enter the nonsexed word ae as a substitute for he and she he didnt get very far with it either but her aim to fix the usages she mentions is silly such neologisms have the habit of fixing themselves by going out of fashion where they belong
excellent post
could have been my grandmother she was welltravelled
its not what you say that matters but what you mean i remember a description of a man as someone who would pronounce the word negro with three gs and i get what that says about someone if your language isnt always gender genderorientation or race aware its probably not because youre a bigot but because youre not up to speed with changes in language use im black and i work with someone who describes black people as coloured i should be annoyed but i know its his ignorance and a wish not to be racistill take offence when offence is meant not when someones trying and failing to avoid offence
much of this is feminisms fault naturally agreed
getting back to willies and fannies when i was a child my mother used neither she used to say john thomas and lady jane referencing the bookof the same title by d h lawrence i have no idea how common that usage was however
no that possibility is clearly not an option the fault could only ever lie with someone or everyone else 
pc run amok i as a liberal am heartily sick of all this genderspeak
the examples in this piece are puzzling its objectively untrue to claim that boss or ceo are gendered ive had male and female bosses i would refer to them as my boss not bossette not chief executive officeresse mankind is problematic boss and ceo are not the fact that women are underrepresented at board level is a social and economic problem not a linguistic one as many have pointed out fanny is pretty much an exact equivalent of willy same level of offensiveness none same level of sexual connotation none they even both make me snigger exactly the same amount lots though i suppose that says more about how juvenile i can be very i happen to think political correctness is predominantly a good thing it makes sense to avoid language that causes reasonable offence but sometimes i think these other debates about everyday language should hurricanes have genderneutral names should we call boats she make perfectly decent people feel alienated without getting near whats actually important i say this for entirely practical reasons is this going to win the debate is it going to make sexists less sexist it seems to me to be counterproductive and make people even more entrenched theres all kinds of gender inequality the vast majority of which disadvantages women this other stuff is a sideshow
thought it was just me
which actually was sometimes people do stuff without realising their doing it maybe you talk incessantly without letting your male friends get a word in edgeways and then accuse them of manterrupting when they try to tell a story and you dont realise that you are doing it you might be in denial about that
fair comment but your name made me laugh out loud
my experience is that whatever its etymology it is generally used to demean all types of feminism to the point that it has become meaningless rant i do think miike should have that conversation if only to stop his young relatives from coming over as crass losers
i dont think im a sexist i quite like most people really and when you get down to it on the whole most people are largely the same however i dont understand a fucking thing in this article i will almost certainly use the wrong words in the wrong context maybe i should just try harder or be better but that ignores the great underlying problem with sexism in  language has been coopted by a number of people across the political spectrum who use it to reenforce the opinions they already hold
mahdawi what is it with the growing popularity of overtly gendered neologisms english is an endlessly flexible language people making genderpuns eg herstory gaydar brocialism too many journos trying to be the next rebecca mansplain solnit
female homosexuals have their own word but male homosexuals dont gays
i quite like hoohar in both senses
language is important it shapes thought
is that why when people become adults there are so many pricks in volvos
finally we are here now the war is on language itself i have long suspected that the latest of the feminisms has taken a poststructual turn and with that the fight or struggle watching my language here has come to its terminus there is no more inequality between the sexes the war on language confirms it for those who claim to he left i feel for you because the left has long stopped being one
when my younger brother and sister were still quite small our mother took them on an outing with a friend of hers and her two little girls of similar age there was a rainstorm and they all got wet and cold and were put into a hot bath together where of course they began to compare their equipment the two other girls parents were both medicos so they knew all the right words and duly informed my younger siblings that little boys have penises and little girls have volvos
in the uk over in trumpland fanny means something else
meantime back in the real world
i used to go to lectures on this in the salways the same pronouns are neutral until you change them and all hell breaks losenothing is ever neutral
my main problem is the conflation of the two accusing someone of mansplaining is a silencing tactic that has the audacity to make it sound as if the silencer is the victim of the silenced in which respect it is very much like feminazi which is used to make it sound like anyone sticking up for feminism must be a bully
words such as girlboss and manspreading have gone from making an important point to reinforcing the differences between men and women no they never made important points they were always just silly nonsense
to further clarify if someone bangs on about feminazis we may safely assume they are no fan of gender equality whereas mansplain undermines the drive for equality by being used hypocritically
i dont think it takes a lot of analysis to come to the conclusion that i dont like being called dave because it isnt my name and i always introduce myself as david so it is presumptive and rude to do so
i can understand the sentiment of the article fancy going through life being called bloke
first world
my god i bet they were glad when you left
ive heard this kind of thing said elsewhere they wouldnt refer to a bunch of older men as boys but that is simply nonsensical it may depend on locality but boy can be quite commonly used to refer a man where im from even if they are older than the person saying it this article is of course doing its job to ignite irate comments like this so well done
i used to avoid calling women ladies until a young woman pointed out to me that i used the term gentleman as a description of a man with an admirable character and that she took the term lady as having the same complimentary implication ive used that form of address ever since ie thanks ladies to those who have served me in a cafe
are you psychic how do you know this
apparently ladies and gentlemen will no longer do when addressing a mixedsex group being insufficiently genderneutral
if its any help i have
it is but as i said its much easier to control your own feelings because its very unlikely that the world is going to change to a standard that youre happy with but if someone is trying to patronise you then they are doing it for a reason they probably see you as an enemy and personally id rather know who my enemies are which isnt going to happen if they are polite to my face
that sort of thing is out and out bigotry its damning that its put behind a protective barrier where it cannot be criticised
hen senga
personally ive given up and just call everyone entity that pretty much covers everything anyone has ever tried to identify as man woman dog rock etc
great examples but i do not think any of the examples from either of us can trump this expose of shocking racismhttpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreeaugadvertisingracismmeerkats
come to leeds everybodys a love
i shall make sure not to say anything endearing to you if we ever meet
male friends of mine are fed up with other blokes assuming it is ok to call them mate i should think so an overt expression of the constant desire to mate with ones colleagues is harassment pure and simple
in that instance i did not mind being called girl or even princess the suggestion that his uttering of the words girl and princess in this situation was unobjectionable is offensive problematic and dangerous even if you personally were not offended like a victim cannot exonerate her perpetrator from his most perpetrators are men crime your acceptance of one of means by which the patriarchy operates does not make it ok though good up to this point the last paragraph of this article ruins it and renders its net effect gendered power differentials unfavourable
my apologies i shall sack myself immediately
really thick stupid people have a right to be offended too you know
are we reading different posts because the answer is most definitely within the question that i read ie the question from theardis i meant what term do you use to get the attention of a group within a classthe answer within the questionattention class
just read  for the first time in a decade interesting principles in newspeak and the eradication of language lets follow our literary example and just call each other comrade then we cant offend each other on gender issues regardless of the over precious or not sensibilities of the comrade we are addressing must admit though i would feel a helluva lot more offended on many other issues should something like this come to pass
true all different ages in my office but the women often refer to us as the boys
i wonder if the guardian is happy to generate comments on hadley freemans article for instance there she proposes that men need to be banned from the workplace i suppose the only thing we can assume is that the guardian literally detests men
my nmissis used to lead a team of outdoor instructors who she used to call knobheads none of them took offence
id say get off your pc and get out more
really not just in the workplace but always i really dont want to live a completely anodyne life on the offchance that some hypersensitive person might take offence at me saying something entirely reasonable
its also entirely our choice whether or not we patronise and belittle people so rather than foisting on them the choice of whether or not to be annoyed or upset we could just be respectful of each other
yes well said the only acceptable term of address for anyone is comrade
yes another revolutionary idea maybe males and females actually like each other and generally get on just fine heretical i know 
im only ever called madam i must have a grim stern face and dont look like a love or princess at all or its just recognition that im  i must say i prefer madam i feel old school bossy and i quite enjoy that
it was not went on all over the place
ps i used to have a female boss with a team of male staff who she always called my boys none of us took offence
telling you what to do were
all these things are in the eye of the beholder which is where they reasonably should be lets try to avoid compiling a pc manual of permitted forms of address
fwiw im with ms nicholson on this one yes its true some women refer to each other as girls from time to time but its equally true that it can be construed as and is often used as a dismissive term for an adult female and in some cases a male of any age always stick to straightforward descriptions that cant be misconstrued even if the intent is completely innocent
love the sarcasm
yeah fair enough on things like love darling princess etc i dont like being called any of those either theyre pretty gruesome in my view one of the girls one of the guys seems fine but i guess its all a matter of personal taste but regardless of taste we also need to relax a little and stop being so offended by every other little fcking thing perhaps we should allow ourselves to get offended by more important things
no i think lemmy just dyed his
its moving slowly towards shaved heads and boiler suits for all
curiously i find hello ladies doesnt work with women and suprise bitches doesnt work with men
its not all feminists im a feminist and dont care what i get called as long as im not expected to answer
i guess you totally missed the point boy
it was the funniest thing that happened to me all week not hard to believe
the article came to a quite nice conclusion that she didnt mind being called princess on at least one occasion call me love girl princess however and ill summon up my feminist hordes and make a real pc song and dance bah
to answer the headline when feminists choose to whinge about it
no there really isnt
victim culture if we blame others for how we feel then we never have to take responsibility for ourselves
 i had some work to do at an mod site at lunchtime i was given a ticket with which i could exchange for a meal in the canteen there was a queue of servicemen at the servery when it moved along the chappie in front of me asked for some baked beans on his pie and mash the girl behind the counter spooned some beens onto his pie he looked at his pie and said is that all the beans i get you fg tart the girl behind the counter laughed and put more beans on his pie the chappies behind me and in front all laughed too it seems that misogyny is alive and well in certain organisations even today 
utter peevishness by this writer im north of  and love being referred to as a girl i also live in an area where females are frequently referred to as pet flower sweetheart and hinny etc i dont take offence at any of them in fact i find them rather endearing it takes a special kind of joyless guardian journo to take offence where none is intended
it always sounds cheesy and sad its like saying gents ive never heard anyone call a group of men or women ladies or gents without sounding like a wanker irrespective of gender its cheesy and embarrassing like something david brent would say
i think your comment is going to offend some feminists
by that time face to face communication will be a thing of the past and autocorrect will immediately erase any gendered terms used online
you choose to be be annoyed by something why not choose a different feeling
i think girls and boys are just americanisms that have crept into the language arent they and i think you shot yourself in the foot with the dad dance line bit gender specific age stereotypical disrespectful 
and she knows the context of comments made to others by others how exactly
drear person please watch your languageoh person of indeterminate gender
if youre trying the get the attention of a particular group within a class you wouldnt say mates or loves would you how would that group know you were referring to them youd say something which let them know who you were talking to like all those sitting near the window
i really cant see the problem here isnt girls the equivalent of boys lads or even chaps and fellas despite appearances most of us have never really grown up anyway and if youre like me still think youre some ridiculously young age girls and boys is probably quite an accurate description
its actually impossible to argue against being labelled as patronising like being accused of being argumentative
and no doubt be told that scalping was a myth
saw this years ago in the porter cottage on sharrow vale road when a male and female couple of freshers were waiting to be served when the barman asked the girl ha see what i did there what do you want love he was treated to a mad aggressive tirade from this charming home counties female as to what a sexist pig he was he bore this entirely stoically then turned to the bloke and said what about you love she had no idea that her world view was not universal and was stunned marvellous to witness
oh they do the late great lemmy said hed never be old enough for greywhite hair he was  or  when he died with coal black hair
you read articles like this and all they do is perpetuate the stereotype that women are all selfabsorbed emotional messes it really doesnt do feminism any favours or maybe this is what passes for feminism these days get some perspective girl
that is fine it was worth it
or come to think of it this one which is essentially the same articlehttpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreefebdontcallmebabeonthebus
may you too be forever young and the author in the name of magnanimity
oh do lighten up rebecca why do feminists always take offence when none is intended
its only annoying if you choose to be annoyed by it much easier to take control of your feelings than expect others to because this is a diverse world with  billion people and a lot of them are going to do things that annoy you but its your choice to be annoyed by it
because most of the topics relating to gender relations recently have been on the metoo scandal and opening comments runs a massive risk of people in the comments either making unproven allegations or naming people youre not legally allowed to name in the paper
thats pretty good but you do realise someone will be along to complain about your terminology
i think its a regional thing im so used to mate from living down south a long time that i often call my wife mate
tolerably well old bean tolerably welland you
perhaps you could point out what in my post is chauvinistic or are you just throwing mud now pathetic
tbh that is entirely her fault if you start out with some mild outrage and a clickbait headline to draw people in then dont be surprised if people assume that your article isnt going to wind up being at least partially well rounded i mean what exactly has anyone gained from this piece some self proclaimed feminists will stop at nothing to find something to be offended about
welcome to the no fun zone communication by semaphore only please
ive already done that one see above there may be a copyright problem
i consider myself a feminist however i dont limit my ideas to my own peer group
i think there does have to be a logical reason for finding out why something bothers you if you dont want to be bothered by it because in the real world you will have to deal with people that bother you because  billion people arent all going to know what does and doesnt bother youso its much easier to take control of your feelings than expect the world to know youre feeling

oh no it doesntwhat planet are you from ive known lots of decent chaps refer to the ladies but ive also known a lot of sour pusses who love to stand aside and gripe later about ordinary people nowadays they post it on here
when i read stuff like this i feel like handing in my liberal badge and becoming a right wing tosspot
my youngest sibling does not like being called girl or love when i asked them why they replied pfalze i am a fat bloke with long hair cant they see past the hair ps he does have his fathers hair
damn just when you get used to one thing 
thats a bit presumptive you should refer to her as natasha devon the person or a person called natasha devon
yep it definitely does
given what she writes and the self description as a feminist then i fear that opening the mind is not on the agenda
indeed context requires interpretation and while i feel she made a valid point she perhaps overreacted to his use of girls in that particular situation
if you bit id probably tell you to piss off if you said please dont call me that id say ok sorry and move on
better than sperm donors
my lover not love in brissle surely
ireland where girls get called lads 
take the nword i might as well have written nigger because everyone knows that what it stands for it is just a word and only has the meaning that its context gives it now if used in the way described by stcenturylipogripe where everyone uses these epithets in a friendly manner then the word in that context does not have the cultural and historical baggage so often associated with it therefore not racist
agreedand i wouldnt concede at the very least myself ill stick to it is right to be right i wont budge an inch in response to those saying oh so you think youre so much better just because youre moral and all which is all they are saying really
do you call men by that word
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone does it i think it reveals that oldman is a pillock nothing more nobody in the uk shares those opinions its just that the us is backward in this respect
i like political correctness to the extent that i just want everyone to be nice to each other and dont really see an issue with not using language that offends others and certainly if someone tells me something is offensive then ill try not to use the same term in the future id agree though that there are those who take delight in attacking people for what they say even if its inadvertent this is particularly the case on twitter when theyll someone with their polite request that the person stop using that word particularly if they dont like that person to begin with its a lazy way of pretending to be an activist or ally when really its just flattering the ego and spoiling for a fight
gary oldman is a legend
so you have never said something that someone else may be offended by how do you know that
i object to the use of the word journalist to describe james delingpole
he was pretty badass in die hard too oh wrong actorthey all look the fecking same to me
thats your interpretation even if youre right lolas claim that many in positions of wealth power and influence continue to say whatever they damn well please would still be wrong oldman had to apologise however sincere so we dont live in a society where he can say whatever he damn well pleases
there is far too much focus on indirect interpretationor hidden meaningif i call a woman a cuntwhich i very rarely do just for the record its because she is onethere is nothing sexist about it as after all she is completely entitled to call me a dick words only have special powers if we give them to them if people want to make a big deal out of something they willlike this articlegary oldman may not have expressed himself in the best way but i still dont think he will deserve the over the top backlash coming his way from an overly sensitive society begging for righteousness
i think you need a dictionary so you can look up the word forbids
greater equality is not a sufferance but a human right we are all equally capable of not taking offence 
the view of political correctness as humourless language policing is generally accurate it goes beyond simply trying to convince people to have good manners into policing in some quarters its basically a substitute for doing anything practical or a mask for a sense of powerlessness arranging deckchairs on the titanic it used to be called ideologically sound language in the ss i recall as a student being on the committee of an amnesty group dominated by  individuals who spent more time in the meetings worrying about genderinclusiveness in the newsletter going out to members than about the kosovan prisoners who should have been the main focus it can be used to bully within minority groups imposing a certain view of for example disability congenitally disabled people say its wrong to talk about being confined to a wheelchair because to them its a liberating way of getting about but to those who havent always been wheelchair users it may indeed seem confining why should their perception of it be treated as unacceptable its as if there is only one permissible way of viewing the situation which has to be imposed even when other people may not share it meanwhile benefits are being cut people abused in real life but some think its a great victory if they can police the language of people who are actually on the same side i get pretty miffed about this because i have several close friends and family members with various disabilities
i meant to add thanks for adding that parallax
one of the worst aspects of political correctness is that it forbids one from saying things that are very likely true and should really be said but one dare not say them
political correctness as humourless language policing is an idea so normalised that blatantly racist sexist ableist and homophobic slurs can be protected under the rubric of free speech no free speech says you cannot be prevented from saying these things it does not mean you are protected from any response and yes i believe that people have a right to say any stupid thing they want just as others have a right to point out that stupidity it really bothers me when journalists have such a wrong idea of what free speech means
oldmans comments are bizarre and certainly merit a robust response this article may be such response but i could not for the life of me understand what is meant by believing in equality and the fundamental changes that are required to realise it means working on ourselves as individuals at the level of language and the institutions that sustain our unequal societysimply minding your words isnt enough and when we say it is we leave the values of the term open to lip servicemoments where the veneer of tolerance and respect are unmasked should be viewed as useful instances for reflection could the writer please explain in simpler terms
you have the right to use words like fucking jew to my face and i then have the right to punch you in the face deal i mean you should be prepared to suffer the consequences of your actions right that is freedom freedom to act but also freedom to suffer the consequences because with freedom comes responsibility
yes but in this context theyre not the same thing though are they oldman was suggesting that it was hypocritical for people to claim they have never said anything abusive that could offend certain people he was not making slurs against a group of people based on their ethnicity or gender per se it is not the same as desecrating graves and daubing racists abuse all over the place and to suggest that it is trivialises the latter
intent matters is the two word summary of what oldman was trying to say and hes right its not appropriate or clever to use overtly rude language but someone who says something offensive out of spontaneous anger or drunkenness is not so bad as someone who does so out of hatred but intent is largely meaningless to the person on the receiving end of the slur or attack and if ones intention is benign its easily solved by apologising rather than trying to excuse what youve said if you think theres nothing to apologise for that suggests the issue of intent isnt as clear cut
i dont dismiss it out of hand if thats what you mean i take the time to try to understand it and make an informed decision based on it pros and cons he has good points and bad ones
to be politically correct is to be right or at the very least to be politically correct means showing basic human decency
i simply do not believe that anyone has gone their entire lives without uttering something someone would find offensive whether through anger jest or too much booze
i guess i simply dont understand the need for an agenda in this instance considering what he said was wrong to begin with no further sensation was needed apparently it was a nine hour interview and lots was left out even if thats the case im not sure what could be added to take away from some of those answers
if you honestly believe the differences between the sexes have been eliminated through language or otherwise youre living in a dreamworld youre half right in that banning the various slurs that you typed out here wont end racism sexism transphobia or any other ist or ism youre so keen to defend but at the same time screaming from the mountain tops that you should be allowed to use these words at all cost especially above the feelings of vulnerable groups affected by these kinds of slurs doesnt exactly help bring about love peace or understanding either
i like a drink as well as the next man as long as the next man isnt mel gibson ricky gervais
bigotry is in fancy the pc brigade only focuses on some religions and some groups the hypocrisy is breathtaking here in comments the scots nationalists call people white settlers which implies that people dont have equal rights in their own country they use the same invective about english which could never be said about jews the hatreds spewed on immigrants are over looked because its acceptable to hate immigrants in the pc world and muslims are regularly slandered as some universal demons yet speaking about the jewish power elites that dominate american finance and media is a sin the pc brigade are sycophants to power they do nothing for bigotry it just reincarnates in to the latest fashion gary oldman took on the power elites and had to grovel whereas hacking at the weak has aways been pc
next youll be calling a road safety officer a lollipop lady you must be from the th century
i think the balls he was speaking of were metaphorical for more examples of this popular metaphor listen to bon scottera acdc
pc had overall been a good thing but unfortunately its now led to us living in a society where were not allowed to criticise things that are blatantly wrong because we might offend an individual or a certain group of people the are certain religious that we cant say a bad word about because were called racists and bigots by people like laurie penny
language has the power to construct reality which is why political correctness seeks to narrow the language of acceptable debate political correctness is not about the banning of gratuitously offensive jokes its about the control of people thoughts its about herding people into particular thought systems and keeping them there what oldman said was factually correct but still he has been forced to issue a grovelling apology for stating a fact that political correctness
gary oldman said those words yes but we should never let the facts get in the way of the agenda this is the grauniad after all
here she goes again defining what is right for everyone and what we should believe rubbish the condescending nature of lola is so annoying
well im going to exercise that freedom of speech and say that everyone who voted for ukip is selfish and racisti may or may not believe thisyou cant have it both ways you dont get to whinge about politcial correctness and then complain about what other people say and if the best thing you can say about your speech is that its not illegal then perhaps you should think twice before saying italso were british not american so we dont have a right to free speech enshrined in a constitutionyou get to say whatever you want but that applies to other people too
when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots i subscribe to the louis ck school on the word faggot lta hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuotajrtywgthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuotajrtyw warning contains the word faggot
whos we because i havent when i get very angry at people i find that asshole does the trick
was oldman intoxicated at the time like gibson
i was wondering why gary oldman was groveling so pathetically on jimmy kimmel last night
not sure of the point of all this oldman is an actor he acts perhaps mozart beethoven picasso goethe tolstoy bach shakespeare plato wittgenstein turner olivier dickens marquez orwell etc etc all once expressed an opinion somewhere that we might have found politically distasteful which isnt pertinent to them doing the thing they are percieved to have been good at is it
nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive by the same token when people use nonpc words and dare i say it jokes it does not mean that they are biggots etc
sometimes humour derives from offence stereotyping its a sheltered environment that is never exposed to this you can poke fun at something without necessarily believing it im not a big fan of mel gibson and i think what he said was disgraceful but i wont presume to know his views based on the little information i have
i think theres obviously merit in the idea that people shouldnt be deliberately rude to one another shouldnt need a special name really but i think it seriously undermines the idea that there are a lot of people whose interest really is in language policing i can go on tumblr right now and find any number of people who think calling someone an idiot is being ableist or that implying women have vaginas is offending trans people intent matters is the two word summary of what oldman was trying to say and hes right its not appropriate or clever to use overtly rude language but someone who says something offensive out of spontaneous anger or drunkenness is not so bad as someone who does so out of hatred
but freedom is not absolute your freedom ends when it impinges on others freedom
huh the amount of time i spend on the internet arguing with people and ive never heard of that before guess something good did finally come out of this
there were similar bleatings of outrage from a certain set of privileged gender normative journalists when they all rallied together in defence of the infamously transphobic julie burchill article that aired in the observer one of her defenders who argued that even someone with obnoxious views should be allowed the inalienable right to be published in a newspaper happened to be the editor of the jewish chronicle this then caused me to wonder what his reaction would be if vile holocaust revisionist david irving were to approach him with an article for publication in the jc
i find what gary oldman said utterly repellent and the whole sorry incident is a disgrace its hubris gone mad and shame on him but i dont need lola to inform me that this is the case i know this is the case and i teach my kids that this behaviour is immoral and utterly unacceptable yet people make mistakes get drunk get angry get pissed off get into fights hurt people divorce scream get drunk on flights are unstable have affairs shout scream cry and laugh and unfortunately make bad mistakes in life lola its called being imperfect so please try not to be so pious in every single article you write do you have to judge all the time every one who makes a bloody fool of themselves and its all a question of judgement yes hes wrong yes hes a bloody fool yes he deserves to feel guilty and shameful but that has nothiong to do with pc he was wrong full stop
admit it pc is just code for getting me and my mates into power you dont even have to be a member of the said minority you merely have to speak on behalf of them how you act as a medium for a whole race for example is a matter of debate this hampers any nonsanctioned opposition because they havent checked their privilege for all of liblabcons bleating about lack of whoever is in power theyre as white and middle class as ever and so it shall remain a couple of token minorities will of course slip through but come back when one holds a great office of state
people get narked when the minority group can use the word but they cant they find it controlling that certain words which i acknowledge whole heartedly has power should be deemed unacceptable to be said by them but not by another in comparing two groups go is complaining that celebrities are held to higher standard than others eg jews can say the yword but he cant black people can say the nword but he cant the average joe in the street can say these words without their whole career being tarnished and crashing because of pc one off the cuff remark when drunk angry or frustrated shouldnt be the ending of a career or indeed making one a social pariah
its called atl trolling
insults made when drunk is normally because alcohol brings out your true character best to drink in moderation or go on the wagon then
well done on labelling him a racist despite not actually knowing whether or not he is which proves his point perfectly
political correctness has become just another power game the righteousness of the superior thinkers  years ago as an adolescent in gb it used to be the middle class vs the poor churchgoers vs the non churchgoers north vs south and yesmen vs women normal society versus gays black vs white left thinkers vs right lets keep the status quo and unable to think groups have been formed to protect the rights of these people intellectuals spend time effort and money to defend them if our education system churches and other religious groups had taught us to respect each other irrespective of our beliefs sexual tendencies intellectual or financial level in society we would have fewer problems than we have now but there will be always somebody who will want to play the power game and consider themselves superior for whatever reason
i dont know about mel he got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things i havent gaz
who is we all leaves out of this oldman i have never used racially offensive language in three decades of being on this earth it wasnt particularly difficult to do
nowadays the irreflective use of these terms sexism racism etc is often the sign of an individual who hasnt thought an issue through a charitable way of describing a moron love it
funny that they are both notable for being conservatives in industries where its the norm to be liberal i wonder what gary middleagedmans politics are
the point he was making is that being angry means you lash out and try to use hurtful words to do so the words are meant to be hurtful but it doesnt mean you are a racistits the anger that should be recognised and seen for what it is the words are just a weapon and shouldnt be seen as the hidden beliefs of the person saying them
ps voltaire didnt say that he said something similar but not that just fyi
why on earth would you say what you dont mean thats the racists defence plus it was a rant about jews i doubt he didnt believe it
gary oldman is a wanker
where do you work i can genuinely say i dont hear racist anti semetic language on a daily basis if oldman is complaining that being a celebrity brings greater media focus than being an average joe well how has he not realised that and what exactly is wrong with that
its like to exercise my right to offend by pointing out that youre a bigoted numskull by the way
i doubt they could but lets face it in the long list of things that oldman got wrong in that interview thats the least of the things he should worry about
whys that is it offensive to women
comedy is not language designed to construct reality its language designed to tease out of us what makes us anxious in reality laughter is an adaption its what happens when our anxiety is unwarranted false alarm were all bread to be hyperactively anxious towards issues ongenderrace etc comedy teases our anxieties about these issues to generate laughter
one problem is that the backlash against pc has been extended to good manners and what used to be thought of as british values some of which are now placed under the pc umbrella and attacked
i dont think avoiding using racial slurs to refer to people is humourless language policing
language has the power to construct reality no it does not
question is why does the media treat what actors say good or bad with anymore weight than that of anyone else this nonsense about pc behaviour is more about people liking to feel superior by condemning others when they have probably committed similar acts
could jon stewart really get away with saying thatdidnt bill maher lose his show at one point due to saying something considered unacceptable about the  hijackers not being cowards
fair enough but i am in total agreement with her and even i thought the way she expressed what he said was unfair on him besides im not sure now that she does accurately reflect him  there was certainly more nuance or maybe even just more pc language in what he said as i said i just dont think it was necessary
i dont see why some people dont understand thisleast of all oldman free speech does not mean speech wont have consequences oldman seems to argue with people reacting negatively to abusive speech but that is their right in a free society
ah ok no problem
yes there isyour post
perhaps you could recommend some good guy nazi films theres nothing intellectual about calling someone a fking ct and while one is entitled to views and perspective one does not necessarily have the right to express it verbal assault is a crime under the public order act  the crime and disorder act  and the criminal justice act  thank you google
liberty and free speech does not dictate that you can say what you want without people reacting negatively to them or it being consequence free quite too many are happy to forget that with freedom comes responsibility
i will buy a copy of playboy and judge for myself in the privacy of the shed
yeah and that sentiment is wrong but this blog is making it sound like he wanted to run down canal street yelling that and even then the baldwin e is more likely hes defending the guy for yelling at a pap which i can almost understand hes just defending the wrong person again i agree that what he said was totally wrong but this article isnt addressing what he actually said which is why i object to it
yep we love that shit
before you open your dumb mouth next time check to see if you own a pair of balls first only malebodied people are entitled to opinions or what on earth do you mean
bollox if you use racial insults youre a racist plain and simple obviously you reach for that as you see it as a negative i dont think its possible to be racially abusive towards someone and not be a racist yourself a racist in denial
oh what if i say one thing and people i dont know on the other side of the world think i mean another what poor people how could i possibly contribute to their sadness
its not really about swearing though is it its about the fact that their is institutionalized imbalances of power
he never actually apologised to the gays
because the media and those of us who consume that media encourage them to think that acquired situational narcissism i believe is the term its our fault really we do it to them im being serious not sarcastic
we all know that a film critic might review a new film with the words this incredible pile of garbage couldnt hit an unmissable target with a perfect weapon and the only words that make it onto the poster will be incredible unmissable and perfect so it is with journalists taking words out of context frankly oldman should have known better
here is what gary oldman said i dont know about mel he got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things were all fucking hypocrites thats what i think about it the policeman who arrested him has never used the word nigger or that fucking jew im being brutally honest here its the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy or maybe i should strike that and say the n word and the f word though there are two f words now there is more and here is the complete interview to for context httpwwwplayboycomplaygroundviewgaryoldmanplayboyinterview
i dunno plenty of people would understand if you referred to someone as wideeyes in china
hollywoods no country for old man not starring gary oldman
have a recommend
yea but lets invent our own instead of some american tv watchers hand me down
okay okaycant an angry white male even have a moment of rage without the bloody word police nitpicking over a word i have no option but todelete my account
always use guys hey guys i brought in cake hey guys anything for the agenda have thought about it only recently as maybe a problem should check my privilege as a white female part time office workerhate the word people the word guys feels organic so i still use it if anyone can suggest a better catchall term that feels normal would love to hear it
i love german
surely guys for a mixed group is just an abbreviation and balance can be regained by a return to the full phrase guys and dolls as long as it isnt guys and gals
feminism has run out of things to accuse men of when it gets to the point that you can no longer use the word guys without offending someone if you want to stop being gender specific youll need to find another word for feminism personally i prefer equalism which is the espoused aim of feminism without the gender specific terminology
this is one of the most stupid issues guardian has ever covered like your my newspaper of choice but you waste way too many column inches covering ridiculous sociological trivia why because its trendy in all my years of work ive never heard complaint from male or female about the term guys being used genderneutrally who cares one the main features of language is that it is constantly mutating thats why we dont speak the english of shakespeares day you guys should ban any job applicants with sociology degrees in their resumes stupid science which changes its core canon every  years because people dont bother to validate their theories using scientific method ghastly
of all the bloody causes morrison could find to support and spearhead what a waste i cannot help but feel this guy has chosen and is riding the horse pc to be flavor of the month thought the other finalists deserved the australian of the year rather than morrison just been proven correct havent heard boo from him all year and now this bullshit
everyone in thailand calls me coon brian a bit off i always think
doubleplus good one approval plus two
dont really know what is more frightening the fact that you believe that women continue to be erased from everything or the fact that  people at the time of me posting this have agreed with you but you dont actually believe women are being erased from everything because all evidence actually points to the contrary so one wonders what your agenda is here to be perfectly honest
being offended by the term guys how about the incessant use of the words awesome totally and like soooo 
i am female so hi ladies absolutely fine with me hi guys also fine with me my point is that to me hi guys is simply used as a greeting thats how i use it when i say it i am not making a specific reference to the sex of the person or the group of people i am addressing
youve pretty much posted exactly the same thing multiple times in the comments btl here do you have anything to actually add to the discussion without playing the victim if this is the depth of the feminist argument is it any wonder that nobody takes your cause seriously anymore
the image that springs to mind is a vet talking about to a group of animalshumans are animals so it is fine to call human females females the sentence the bitches are restless today puts me in mind of a vet talking about dogs the sentence the queens have their claws out today puts me in mind of a vet talking about cats
male and female denote sexes not genders most comments that are called sexist are in fact genderist not sexist
but that meant something ie dont slouch in listen up the up is redundant i do seem to remember hearing that it was a military thing about barking a command with a plosive if thats the correct term ending so that it would attract greater attention whatever i find it annoying
or even less genderpolitically using ladies to take the mick out of the term guys as in ladies guys whatever people basically
you clearly dont understand but i dont think there is much point in continuing this conversation and so i will leave it to you to make the last comment but if as i suspect you have nothing worthwhile to say i suggest you keep schtum
a hole in thier donkey
not whining insulting
those who complain are just the usual immature pc crowdthey can be safely ignored
better to whine about your own existence than to constantly whine online about what other people post
why not
its from victorian schooling everybody listen and sit up
i find it is only gentlemen with african heritage who call me boss and i find it uncomfortable almost as though they said massa id prefer the word chap although in bristol the other day the lady behind the counter was calling all the men luvver not ideal either but acceptable locally
the guidance video looks like a perfect tongueincheek parody right down to the mad unblinking stare of the presenter with friends like this feminism doesnt need enemies
morning tosspots
every body has one
im just glad that we have removed so many problems from our collective lives that the use of a particular word deserves a newspaper article now there is no more fgm daughter burning freedom denial marital rape et al we can concentrate on the real problem of someone using the words guys as a gender neutral term in the office well done
well life would be simple if people like you stopped making it complicated with your way says about words if we all went mute i bet youd find a way of being offended by how someone looked at you if you want to be offended by words go for you life because its your choice i choose not to be because i have more important things in my life to be concerned with
i dont know any feminist female actors who would prefer to be called actresses
i enjoy the nuances of language and find it interesting how words that were once used freely get swept underground others quarantined for a few decades but i dont like banning words unless they are outright offensive because it limits communication restricts meaning starves sentences of information guys to me brings to mind an image of young people mostly teenage males or a bit older partner brings to mind a professional relationship or makes me think the person wishes to hide their gender of their girlfriend or husband in shops i dislike being called sir and would prefer nothing or if anything mate mister and if an older woman dearat work i still use morning everyone how are you all
ja das ist ein guyswagon guys folks you people come on linguistic determinism is a dubious idea language is often a type of fashion increasingly so it seems at the moment perhaps it has been changing faster due to electronic communication tv and those fast moving temporary labour supplies necessary for those that say guys to us as a lingua franca in addressing a captive audience it is often the case that a collective appellation is not required in japanese many sentences are constructed where it can be be assumed that you are talking collectively to others or about yourself merely by context and the words used international comparative analysis ikimasho lets go in anglo saxon puffa jacket neocon control freak speak ok guys we should really be going now in the accent of sarah palin scary in russian poyekhali lets go discussions like this are probably more at home in the why oh why language maven right wing pressmost of it
you need to ask whether they selfidentify as a guy
just realised i should have read this before submitting and realising that i used realised too many times
i hear guys hospital thought about changing their name but then realised that they realised they had real work to do that took precedence over wasting everyones time
except thats not what checking ones privilege is all about its not about considering the opinions of people with different backgrounds its about stopping yourself and saying because of my background i dont have a right to an opinion on this or because of my background my opinion is worth less than someone elses which is really bizarre and so wrongheaded
yes it does the image that springs to mind is a vet talking about to a group of animals
when you start complaining that someone referred to you and your friends as guys its time to take stock of your life amp do something productive with your time
that is german were volk is a singular collective noun in english folk or folks are interchangeable to refer to a group of people although folks is more syrupy so probably sounds incorrect to southern english ears i think the reason we dont have folks law or folks dancing is it just sounds clumsy
is assholes gender neutral enough for the pc brigade
nailed it
yes but if feminists are saying they want gender specific words and not be lumped in with men the word actress is already gender specific the word midwife is gender specific and there has been no suggestion that they should be called midspouses is waitress now taboo the funny thing is that in spain new feminine form words are being constantly invented where previously there was no feminine form words like jueza jefa capataza concejala spanish women are happier with these terms so why arent actresses happy to be actresses your logic is no logic at all its a false syllogism
scuse me while i kiss this guy
that this bellend is australian of the year is a sure sign of the decline of oncegreat nation mick dundee must be spinning in his grave
i pointed out during childbirth when my wife complained about the pain that shed never experienced pain like being punched in the balls she told me that if i didnt shut the fuck up id be experiencing it again in the near future imagine the furore if id offered to pull the equivalent of five bags of sugar out of her vagina and give her  stitches next time she made a joke about it not being as bad as childbirth when i was in pain how is that equality is there any justice in the world
ah come on i assume his tongue was slightly in cheek when he wrote that but as much as the term makes my teeth grate its no bad thing for anyone to consider how other people with a different background to you might think about something 
it is increasingly prevalent in bars and restaurants i was recently out with my parents both in their mids and the barman and waitress welcomed them with hi guys and what can i get you guys it made me cringe every time they said it as with anything its about the context and audience and i would suggest that addressing pensioners as guys is inappropriate
yea but thats the point it didnt used to be
i would prefer folks i know its a bit hokey and inner obama but it just sounds a bit less of a hey yea lets all play at being americans
i do use and i am a womanbut yes well over 
and you get to whine constantly online about how hard it is being a white man doubly so for an ablebodied straight white man
tish and pish to thatif i want to daub humorous slogans in excrement on peoples cars then i will and i dont care what the so called pc brigade say about it 
yep interesting i never use it but i always thought it was more like an attempt to unalphamale the relationship with friends like stop pretending youre cliche toug guys were together kind of thing though as some comments say it depends on the tone and context
yoemitesamuel didnt say it shouldnt matter to anyone they said it shouldnt be important to anyone which is fair enough there are undoubtedly more important things than this in anyones life change a word and you change the meaning of what is being said alright guys crap i mean folks 
feminist writer and activist beatrix campbell is more critical of guys shes also critical of entirely fabricated stories of satanic ritual abuse so its worth taking her views with a pinch of salt and by taking her views with a pinch of salt i mean completely disregard her views
how about good morning teamworked for me for many a year
why is this an issue again i got lost with all the pointlessness of it all
looking at your posting history you seem to only ever post on this sort of topic you are far more interested in this than most i mean about  posts on womenonly glasto when theres starvation and treatable diseases to worry about why
i dont know about other people but guys is used as an inclusive word no one thinks it is only men
this is all getting a bit much for me i thought gender was now a matter of choice anyway rather than something as old fashioned as biological differences so how do you tell who you are addressing 
can someone please tell me what word to use dudes no waygirls and boys seems like talking to school kidsladies and gents too formalpeople what i use currently doesnt really sound great either lets make this positive suggestions please
i have to say i always see folks as a heternormative blokes thing you rarely hear women using it i assume its usually said with the background of invoking involves a male world view i also assume anyone saying it is probably at least  its one of those pieces of vocabulary you can date people on
thats because nobody ever uses it do they ive been here  years and not heard it you call you male bosses girls where
you just need to find a feminist and ask them if youre still white and male if you are still white and male you can relax knowing that youre privileged privileged means you get to work more hours see the kids less be more stressed and die younger
this doubleplus bad me hurty think think
the thing i dont like is when men in shops call me boss i only came in for a carton of ribena i cant handle that level of responsibility
its also annoying because folk is already plural and doesnt need the s old folks home requires an apostrophe
but people doesnt solve this linguistic problem espacially when its listen up people whats up got to do with it
is checking ones privilege something which i should be doing on a daily basis or more or less frequently does anyone have any tips on how i can incorporate this into my daily routine
guys is fine i use it all the time at work and socially i got told off here a few months ago for referring to a girls night out because my female friends and i are obviously not girls anymore language is a minefield
feminist writer and activist beatrix campbell is more critical of guys given her history beatrix campbell should not be listened to
of course guys is sexist and often deeply and gratuitously offensive perhaps especially to those who have fought long and hard to get away from the not very funny man embraces woman school of thought my wife has a badge which says i am not a guy which she wears proudly particularly in restaurants when she points it out she often gets im so sorry madam quite right use of folks works and is fine
these types of articles make my old brain hurt really bad just refer to everyone as you stupid ratfaced gitproblem solved
and yet now the pc term for actress is actor where is the logic in that the logic is that we dont say doctresses or poetesses
it shouldnt matter to anyone really you do understand the concepts of individuality and independent thought dont you just because you dont think it shouldnt matter it doesnt follow that it wont matter to someone i was at a talk last week when david morrison was asked about this because it had been in the press that day some people in the audience agreed with him some didnt its just part of a discussion all he was asking people to do was think about the words they use and yet here in this comments section we have at least two people who have stated that words have no power now thats worrying to me at least
females sounds stupid to me
ive worked in teamsoffices full of women before and the group has been addressed as ladies or whatever even though i was present is it really that big a deal chill outlad
oh sorry that was intended for mitch
me where did i say i represented every woman
i havent been able to watch the video but i think the general issue is that girls is infantalising grown women whereas bloke simply means man
so many men complaining you cant say these days and then those who talk about how the meaning and use of language has changed so we should just go along with it yes it might have changed or is that your excuse today so say whatever you want when youre in your own home and with your friends but when youre in a public or work environment change your behaviour and have a little respect its 
give me strength
why not call everyone sheila
i removed it from my lexicon id love to know how they managed that as every time i try and remove the words berk and pillock from mine articles like this undo all my good work
theyre really not thats an incredibly simplistic thing to say
no it wasnt was it
words are harmless its us that allow them to hurt
meh
theres roughly  million females in australia can the female gender please decide on a single word that you all want to be addressed with i would suggest females would be most appropriate good evening females and good evening guys
being called ladies is considered by men as derogatory and a joke i love being spoken for
whether you should or not i have no idea you clearly do though because you keep coming back to me like youre on a bit of elastic my advice is you do yourself a favour and walk away with whats left of your dignity
surely calling people gents is ok because it could also mean gentlewomennot when i chose which toilet to go in
when i were a lad you werent supposed to swear in front of girls now apparently its offensive to say girls
ditto for buddy
me and my sister always absolutely hate being called guys so the title of this article really made us laugh though the reason why he hate it is when walking into a super preppy shop such as holliester being welcomed hi guys is just super annoying its also grating because theres just something annoying about a boy calling you a guy idk it just is not for pc reasons though its just a little irritation we have
you underestimate the ability of some people to become offended in fact im offended you dont realise they can so easily become offended how offensive
ive just been listening to a trucker song about how you cant say good buddy now 
just call them all females even transgender women are female cant go wrong
im not sure that i understand this a right to be offended what exactly is that
no people are allowed to shit its their right its a basic human need the right platform for shitting is toilets people are allowed to say what they want red carpet platforms shouldnt be rolled out for anti intelligence paedophile praising trolls at universities to spread hate they still free to go their to study and learn
who apart from you is suggesting that certain people should not exist have a look on twitter or failing that the picture at the top of the article
difficult if it happens to you constantly
someone being insensitive is the least of my worries its the hypocrisy that concerns me the same people who talk the loudest shit freedom of speech are nowhere to be found whenever anyone on the opposite is being silenced for even sticking to the subject matter instead of indulging in provocative insults stop taking ownership on freedom of speech if youre not prepared to defend the right of your opponent to express him or herself the national anthem citizens being made liable for policing costs in nonviolent protests the last one to defend it hypocrite cowards crying wolf when censorship occurs while you kept your mouth shut when others needed you no sympathy whatsoever
this research was thoroughly shredded below the line when that article was published this paper really has to raise its standards on this sort of thing and not use shoddy research merely because it happens to reinforce the papers prejudices these are opinion pieces not news the clue my little agitated right winger is in the title of this section opinion
check out what happened at berkeley recently with the black bloc
unlike the genuinely worrying authoritarianism of theresa mays government which is backed up with political power censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger  examples of this governments genuinely worrying authoritarianism please it genuinely doesnt worry me for example  as for censorship of the left being a paper tiger it has actually been enshrined in the supposed consensus of political correctness and in newspapers like the guardian for yonks that its now endemic in universities and university student union politics is symptomatic intellectual fashions tend to originate and develop in universities naturally enough but with universities having begun to emerge from the bankrupt marxistleftist orthodoxy of the last decades students are now being protected from ideas as if they were kindergarten kids who must be safeguarded from strange men
the politicians pander to the immigration minority just as a point of accuracy opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the overwhelming majority of the public want immigration significantly reduced you or i might not agree with public opinion on this but to pretend its a minority is simply untrue
parenting isnt easy and theres no one true path how could there be were all individual people so were all individual parents but insults dont improve relationships i think that can be safely said and poor relationships between parents and offspring cause all manner of emotional problems but if we are going to use the term snowflake to describe the easily upset might it not be applied to those who are offended by foreign speech eg nigel farage dark skin the smell of spices sari shops and the like
if however i call moroccans scum as geert wilders did it is more than offensive it is an invitation to harm moroccans so long as youre willing to apply that line of reasoning to what everyone says then there would not be as many objections the sad truth is that many people operate a do as i say not as i do policy where its okay to call certain groups of people scum or to talk about killing all of them suddenly being ironic makes it all okay
hate crime law is not supposed to protect people from being hated its designed to keep peoples hatred buried in their own mind where it belongs and they can anguish and suffer over it all they like
i really do try and try to stop but its a cultural thing and so i should be left to manspread in peace some twerk i find this offensive and think it is belittles women but i leave them to it so leave me to my manspreading 
one particular theory is pretty meaningless especially considering that most left wing groups hate each other profoundly which is in its self an indication that many strands of the left arent good at accepting differences of opinion
offence can only be caused if someone allows themselves to feel offence observing the words without feeling them is a great tactic mindfulness is a great tool to avoid sensitive little flower syndrome because the revulsion that some call offence is merely a reflection a kneejerk reaction to their own inner landscape many offended people are angry anger is caused by fear what are those who take offence so readily specifically afraid of
a small subjection of the left one can also find that on the right as well but for whatever reason the right as a whole are less keen to identify themselves based on the worst elements of those who vaguely share their politics and indulge in less hand wringing
vital indeedwe shold pair oopi have recently started a campaign to remove the letter u gross i hate typing it from the english langage doo to its obvios demeaning implications in reference to the female reproductive system and the ad hoc way it can be inserted into virtally any word symbolic of the neoconservative attitoode towards women and their role in society
the dog had got old it was incontinent and the owner had decided he couldnt afford the vet s bill like you i find these actions to be those of someone from a different planet
you know deep down that there is no comparison
you dont have the right to not be offended
to what extent do we have a personal duty to consider the impact of our words on other people great question abi
no i dont mean that i know plenty of people who i know for a fact arent racist homophobic etc but still dislike political correctness you need to grasp that disliking political correctness doesnt automatically make you a bigot
sorry i have never resorted to abuse simply because someone doesnt agree with me everyone on here has an opinion which they are entitled to but that doesnt mean you have to resort to abuse
we saw this recently with the whole is it okay to punch a nazi debacle and the riots by students at uc berkley even worse less than a century ago we saw how the concept of merely having a hateful ideology allowed us to slaughter hundreds of thousands of nazis with impunity what were we thinking please think your views through more carefully language has power you will never ever get the world to agree that physical violence against extremists isnt sometimes justified because very deep in our bones we know it is and it can also be borne out by reasoning
definitely i have a strong dislike for many different ideologies but if they were noplatformed id be one of the first to call out the bullshit for what it is
the question is of course should free speech be absolute in my opinion it should not be
it is funny that those who claim that they should have the right to offend would be the first to shout out their opposition to a male nudist walking to a primary school naked to pick up their children a far right writer advocating sex between older men and boys and men groping their wives or daughters double standards or just claiming for themselves the right to besexist racist or simply obnoxious
i find it offensive that a group of women should have pandered to a mind set which can refer to women as maidens as spotless virginity was a prized asset it carries suggestions of people as commodities
although it was historic comments that did for him and ironically comments that reflect similar arguments that have been made in this paper he wasnt shown up for his views being wrong although i think they are but socially unacceptable amongst the wrong group ie his supporters
another piece of research found that girls as young as six believe intellectual brilliance is a male trait actually it didnt it showed within margin of error that girls were equally likely to associate brilliance with males as with females it was the boys that were biased towards males just because the girls were less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender than boys were doesnt necessarily mean they associate it more with males
i would suggest the way to stop the altright getting more and more offensive is simply to stop being offended
unfortunately i fell for it five minutes of my life lost forever 
perhaps its because in this country a sort of unreflective conservatism is the default attitude to life hence all the concern about finding the centre in politics the safely normal casual lowlevel racism for example goes largely unrecognised as such because theres nothing particularly threatening about it its just part of the common currency of being traditionally english once you realise this of course its not so easy to play the game and people find you odd and embarrassing if you object
ive also heard q in lgbtq to be questioning rather than queer so i dont think theres a consensus about q
clooney can say what he likes however i have a right to say that i do not believe that him using his celeb status as to gain advantage on a political platform is good for democracy shapiro is a political journalist and not an actor or singer who uses politics for career enhancement
words can do spectacular harm you say something to someone enough and theyll start to believe it there are types of harm that arent physical as the many examples above point out
then its just a suggestion that we should be nicer to one another a commonplace piece of advice that has been expressed untold billions of times before so why pay someone to write such a banal article and why should we waste any time reading it
bugger the microaggression i prefer macroaggression any day of the week
no you are correct about his plea people plead guilty when they know they will definitely be convicted in order to receive a lesser sentence that was the case in staceys situation albeit without receiving much credit for it when sentence was passed stacey broke the law as it stands im not disputing that in the slightest i am simply stating that people can indeed be sent to prison for expressing a thoroughly unpleasant opinion not necessarily a threat as you originally implied
what are the selfish needs of the young and how exactly has the education system pandered to them and id always assumed snowflake means more in the way of youre a special snowflake
northlondonhousewife you are missing my point hostility is a very strong and active current in human affairs it causes huge levels of suffering most of it easily avoidable we could do something about this but of course we never will whilst we shelter behind denial and naivety
you come from a social group which is continually denigrated a brexit voter
every couple of weeks another article will be published railing against campus noplatforming there is nothing wrong with railing against the policy of noplatforming those who seek to deny others a democratic and lawful freedom of expression should be attacked leftwingers policing language and proclaiming pompously how vital it is that we should be free to offend something you clearly practise yourself miss wilkinson many brexiters especially those who have served their country in the armed forces will have no doubt been offended by your assertion that only remainers could be described as patriotic your point of view is offensive to many but i would not noplatform you for it because nobody has the right not to be offended while we recognise that free speech should be a protected right to what extent do we have a personal duty to consider the impact of our words on other people i agree but the question has to be asked do you as a journalist whose views here and on twitter always ask that question of yourself just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should thats up to the individual choice of the actor but is probably a more important question than the few words you have allocated to it would suggest
but when people start to use words differently or introduce them to contexts they did not used to be in i think the people the word is being used to describe should be able to point it out and be listened to if they dont want that word to change to cover them how does that work in the real world how could someone use the word queer to designate some gay men but not others especially given that some gay men deliberately use the word to designate gay men in general as is their right that use clearly has nothing in common with the way it was previously used by homophobes the intention behind it is completely different that is why as i said it is importance to show some tolerance and to judge peoples words on the basis of peoples intentions
i know quite a good joke about thor puncline is well i can hardly thit down
free speech that praises paedophilia there is a line red carpets shouldnt be rolled out for such speakers
you mean look im not being racist but ive nothing against gays but
i dont think its selfevident that speech does not and cannot cause harm nor that any concept becomes settled particularly as our ability to obtain greater evidence develops anyway whats wrong with intimidation or shaming by speech if speech causes no harm this seems inconsistent if speech causes no harm then the backlash is merely due to not liking what is said not any larger considerations
hes just exercising his freedom of speech that seems to bother you somewhat
how is this comment in any way relevant to this discussion who apart from you is suggesting that certain people should not exist or did saying that make you feel good virtuous and important
i dont believe in sexism woman may not be perfectible but nor is she incorrigible neither education works wonders thank you for giving me the biggest chuckle of the morning thus far
just because you have the right to thinksay what you like it doesnt mean that anyone has any responsibility to host it universities are a special case as i explain here
youre right that its in part down to whether or not one is prepared to learn the skills but numerous studies have also proven that ones perception of ones abilities which are informed by stereotypes affects ones ability to do them tell a group of girls that girls in general perform worse at maths and they will do worse in a maths test than a control group who arent told this etc
 its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged  do you have the statistics on that i dont buy it besides look at all the offensive messages from anonymous trolls being political incorrect and not putting your name under it is even worse
could do whats your excuse
you wont get any hate most people on the g agree with you dont selfmartyrise dude p well if youre such a freedom fighter i hope youll support any type of free speech coming from anyone no matter the subject matter good luck with the internal contradictions of that
in this country people are free to say and think whatever they like they just may be challenged on it or not given a megaphone to amplify it by people who disagree no ones freedom of speech is being curtailed whatsoever the only issue is people on the extreme sides of the argument who are used to being able to spout their opinions as gospel without interference getting upset when they are told to shut the hell up
superb point but community standards must be upheld thus shortly this post must be removed for the good of the nation
i think what people want here is consistency either it must be ok to offend anybody or nobody at all this is only workable and fair if everybody starts out and steps out into the world on a level playing field but they dont if inequality and disadvantage exists for whole groups of people based on their gender age skin colour ethnicity sexuality etcv then it is quite right that marginalised and disadvantaged groups should not be further marginalised and disadvantaged by the cruel and judgemental words and deeds of others it is also right that when people act in a way that disadvantages or marginalises members those groups we can call them what we like because they have chosen their words whereas those they denigrate have not chosen their age skin colour etc
do they riot and stop the leftwingers from speaking at universities though we have this weird situation where the left have the best politics and the most contemptible tactics what happened to the marketplace of ideas
where is the virtue in arbitrarily treating them identically because that is equality do we need another reason
i didnt say ban them just that charisma is dangerous
interesting argument but theres no way of answering your question since we have no idea how bad the situation would be without these laws there are plenty of other factors that account for the rise of intolerance do you really think society would be a better place if say extremist muslim clerics were free to openly preach death to the west in public areas i agree that hate speech is poorly understood as a concept but that doesnt mean we should ditch it completely all of our ways of managing behaviour require arbitrary lines you could equally ask what constitutes selfdefence when it comes to violence this comes up in in courts of law all the time does the other person have to attack first what if theyre waving a knife around and acting erratically but what if they say they just happened to be holding a knife for illustrative purposes and dont think they were acting erratically then theres the whole question of what constitutes a violation of free speech in the first place interrupting people cutting them off on your own show inviting them and then disinviting them to speak at your local theatre drowning them out through a louder soundsystem these arent simple questions
it wasnt censorship that lost milo yiannopolous his book deal and got him sacked from breitbart and rejected by the cpac it was letting him speak freely until he was exposed if you drive bad ideas underground they will fester and rise again more extreme and dangerous you can only truly fight bad ideas with good ideas that means listening to people you disgree with
freedom of speech is the right to be offended the alternative is trump 
there are plenty of people on this very section of this very thread who clearly disagree with you about the merits of political correctness do you want to say to them that theyre against gay rights and gender equality or do real people suddenly pose too much of a problem when they dont fit your abstract stereotype
the difference is that much of the pc debate is social and not as scientific as the shape of the planet to use your other point if there was a university debate on the shape of the planet then a flatearther absolutely should be invited otherwise if its all scientists saying the world is round why bother with the debate at all that is many peoples view on the whole noplatforming thing and the more it goes on the more i agree
while there is a debate to be had this badly written and badly argued sixthform piece contributes nothing whenever a writer advocates a limitation to free speech they should set out their reasoning
maybe he just closed his eyes
restaurants have a code of conduct if you shit on their tables you get kicked out universities have a code of conduct if you say offensive dumb trolling shit you get kicked out universities arent restaurants they are required by uk law to protect the free speech of their members and of any speakers invited by their members the relevant uk law is in the education no  act  where s says every individual and body of persons concerned in the government of any establishment to which this section applies shall take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members students and employees of the establishment and for visiting speakers  the duty imposed by subsection  above includes in particular the duty to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that the use of any premises of the establishment is not denied to any individual or body of persons on any ground connected withathe beliefs or views of that individual or of any member of that body orbthe policy or objectives of that body in other words the university has a duty to ensure that any of its members can invite whomsoever they wish to speak on the universitys premises regardless of the views to be expressed this right of their members to invite speakers is an entirely separate question from the matter of speakers invited by the institution itself as an institution
why is consistency so important different groups of people have different concerns and challenges where is the virtue in arbitrarily treating them identically and yes i would say society has on the whole become a great deal more tolerant since we started openly making each other aware of the impact of our words its only really a bitter little rump of people who resent the arbitrary social power that hegemony gave them being taken away that are causing the problem
to what extent do we have a personal duty to consider the impact of our words on other people according to longstanding tradition everybody has a moral duty to consider the likely effect on others of what they say or do what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbour the difficult question is how far and by what means can you enforce your morality on other people
my  year old daughter thinks i am just fantastic 
but you cant legislate against a smirk or a knowing glance or a subtle piece of innuendo though can you when you start policing language to this extent people will find clever ways of communicating prejudice without using the spoken word the victim is stung harder and excluded even more the most vicious piece of bullying ive ever witnessed was from a group of female teachers on an anti bullying awareness course picking on another colleague 
and you cant beat the hard left by becoming like them either they are two cheeks of an authoritarian arse i always wonder whether people who post nonsense like this consider even for a second whether they should check truthfulness of what they are about to say radical leftwing political theory heralded by anarchism is the definition of antiauthoritarianism
positive amp negative freedoms are a banality primarily because theyre binary conceptsim admittedly vociferous amp im not of the laissezfaire libertarian john stuart mills softlysoftly approach either reality has become mistened by the think tanks of pink fluffy clouds of wrapping our humanistic sense of being in abstract jadednessthe brighton set as i call them will always head for that corner of towie amp all things plasticated amp pseudo avoiding fake due to its current fad of associated meaningidentity has been something of a barolo that rather than be weakened amp blanded by proscriptive journalism just like the nebbiolo grapes that are ripened with increasingly unctuous flavour in the mists of the northern italian foothills identity becomes a powerful tannic monster this is how i perceive the status quo of protest politics alt right or the popularist nationalist movementthese are a mere newfanglement of binary reflectionism through a modern interpretation of the old unionist movements percieved in a reverse psychological perspectivewe need not judge whats offensive or inoffensive because thats the whole point of the reciprocity of a democracy in ongoing reflective practice how does one know through blind ignorance alone that what theyre saying is harmful or notthe reality is that if you want to be blinkered by a fog of wrapping nature in a cotton wool of humanism is that youll crash into something amp eventually amp get hurtwe need to be true engaging amp not be passive otherwise we wont value the feelings we have that are associated to our emotions that help form our identitywe are what we speak
sure and then lets play that game where we join an extreme rightwing internet forum and egg them on until an immigrant or a proimmigration mp is violently attacked and some religious texts contain literal hate speech and exhortations to violence exhortations that are actually heeded and carried out from time to time surely these texts should be banned as well as rightwing hate speech people calling for restrictions on what ideas and speech are allowed might not like the outcome if these restrictions were implemented evenhandedly
thats a true libertarians view the regressive left will hate you for it
they have lost control of the narrative deep down they know it but are completely incapable of admitting it to themselves
as my gran used to say its nice to be nice as my old boss used to say no need to be an asshole all your life
i think when people use words to try to argue for a debate for free speech whilst simultaneously shutting that debate down i think it is fair to regard that as orwellian you dont i do not care
horrible ones
the concepts we are discussing here are not new they have been discussed to death since the time of the enlightenment that is why they are selfevident the only thing that changed is that some have tried to reframe the debate in the last coupled of decades to fit their view of the world and they intimidated everybody else with shaming tactics etc to shut up now this does not work anymore hence the backlash
this argument about the right to do whatever you want was put forward as a reason why the smoking ban was wrong we shouldnt be telling smokers what to do poor snowflakes and nonsmokers had to just tolerate their smoke even though the stuff is toxic and leads to thousand of deaths in nonsmokers every year i am not making that figure up check out official numbers this argument was wrong as the john stuart mill response demonstrates we have many laws which restrict peoples freedom drink driving is the main one why arent people allowed to drink and drive its not because they might harm themselves its because they might cause harm to others likewise you arent allowed to blast out loud music at am because you will be depriving other people of sleep there is nothing wrong with articulating an alternative viewpoint but hurling abuse at someone is not a viewpoint nor is it exercising free speech its just malicious behaviour piers morgan is a classic case in point his tirade against the womens march wasnt him expressing an alternative view otherwise he would have talked about how trump would be great for women how the laws he had signed that week was not harmful or discriminatory or whatever thats not what he was doing what he did was call the marchers names and belittle their legitimate concerns no one is entitled to shriek meaningless insults at another person or try to intimidate them into silence in the same way that a smoker is not entitled to poison the nonsmokers around them freedom is not an absolute otherwise why do we have laws against murder when others are being harmed
i dont think you can dismiss the importance of censorship for instance myself and a group of likeminded people who have probably annoyed you by talking loudly in a restaurant recently have after two years fierce debate drafted a motion to the oed to get the exclamation mark censured as an aggressive and overtlyphallocentric perpetuator of the patriarchal schism vital work im sure youll agree and its not like its distracted us from anything important happening in politics in the last year or so
this is a wellwritten well reasoned article and i agree that what is termed political correctness is often just being a decent human to those around you surely most of us can get on board with that anyone that has a real problem with that is clearly a bit of a dick and wont be coming to my birthday party quite frankly the problem that people who advocate these issues have is that they allow their legitimate concerns to be clouded with frivolities and the quest to find offence where none exists it makes them look ridiculous and allows bigots to tar all campaigners for more inclusive society with the same brush a particularly egregious example of this appeared on these pages not so long ago attacking an emoji an emoji as a cause of suffering ms wilkinson wrote that and in doing so did her debating position a real disservice
so a singledout transgender student at the uni they attend is the same as the us president being mocked on tv a practice that has been going on since there is television i guess context doesnt matter at all then
oooohhh you said his genderhatecrime
attempts to stop people speaking at universities are usually the work of tiny minority exercising their right to free speech usually the speaker turns up amp goes ahead to  students amp a dog holding up placards outside
words do no physical harm the roots of soviet communism hitlers reich and islamic fundamentalism prove you are demonstrably wrong about that
historically men and women have been oppressed in many western democracies only the very wealthy had voting rights some countries gave men the vote after women got it the idea of the wealthy white straight male is only true for a small number many of us can name these billionaires millionaires and members of the nobility everyone else male and female outside of that group has little or no influence or power this was what the union movement set out to address the dissolution of that movement coincided with the rise of political correctness and progressive politics leaving the majority of men voiceless stereotyped as the centre of power when in fact they were overworked underpaid and maltreated class privileged is a key phrase here because many progressives have set the bar too low only very few extremely wealthy men and women may i add can be called classprivileged that earmark of the gfc driving the middle class down the class ladder means that even if you consider yourself middle class you may not be any more the idea that middle class white males have any power or clout is now poppycock the oppressed men and women of our society are a very large group indeed not just the minorities championed by progressives but also everyday people who would once have been considered the majority they may be straight white and male but they are oppressed with just as much of a heavy hand as any minority group these are the tradesmen who are paid minimum wage their wives with university degrees on parttime contracts their kids who work in fast food restaurants is the writer of this column saying these people have white privilege or class privilege neither training nor education has made a difference to their lives the wages are still low the conditions they work and live in are still bad progressives need to understand that singling out one person from a room of the oppressed and saying that they are special is not going to make any friends
yes it is quite bizarre how people are reluctant to accept that men and women are actually different my wife is a very intelligent highly capable woman who has run her own business and worked at senior management level for several large corporates she is highly qualified and went to a very good university when she is driving and we for example approach the m she might ask which way do i go and i might say were heading west that i have learnt means nothing to her she does lot live in a world where she is aware of her orientation i do most women are like her most men are like me why that is i have no idea but it is most certainly the case she could not read a map to save her life
oh be quiet
thor is objectively a legend and nobody could seriously argue that point however i have no time for jupiter or mars who are  year old fake news items
what had the dog done that was so wrong so foul that it warranted such treatment i cant fathom why a nail in the head was not sufficient punishment no you must then bury it alive causing pain visibleaudible agonies is not a natural phenomenon thus it baffles the spirit to know such behaviour occurs when the poor dog was yelping in confused betrayed horror as the nail tip pierced its skull why did neither man cease and desist there must and in most is a natural compassionate mechanism that kicks in great savagery greatly bewilders me but i end up thinking about the bloody why so deeply i make myself cry
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged well yes because thats the group that certain leftwingers constantly attack and blame for everything if youre going to demonise innocent people of course theyre going to object im in favour of political correctness by the way but that should mean not attacking me for being white and male just as it means not attacking others for their race or gender
the alt right isnt very happy with the freedom to offend when its them being offended we get a lot of offended brexiters victim signalling like mad that some nasty liberal has annoyed them
everyone should be free to say and think whatever they like there should be no crimes against what people think and say short of inciting violence against a personpeople of course that does not mean if they want to live in a civilised society that they should why is this concept so difficult to grasp for some people
well this is an interesting comment considering that the dm is running a piece from trevor philips httpwwwdailymailcoukdebatearticlepoliticalcorrectnessgonemadwritestrevorphillipshtml
the problem is the whinging demands that others use their made up garbage terminology um no thanks deal with it i see no whinging demands except from the likes of you who go out of your way to be offended by the fact that other people use these terms whiny fucking rightwingers you cant open a window without them complaining that its normal and natural for windows to stay closed
because its a label some stick on others without their permission often in a slightly scornful way that is all
im of the left and none of these words are part of my vocabulary nor are triggered safe space and the like the word bullshit is though
its not moral relativism so much as reality relativism
if others dont understand our theories then we need to explain them better if others have a flawed opinion then we need to give them the chance to change it it sounds a little bit as if you hold your opinions as absolute truth like a religion that might be why you talk about potential converts as well i dont think thats something that the left should be doing in my understanding the left champions the values of the enlightenment enlightenment is a persons emergence from their selfimposed immaturity immaturity is the inability to use ones own understanding without the guidance of another so guiding someone elses understanding to what you think is the absolute truth is not an enlightened approach the enlightened approach is to engage in rational debate trusting that your position will win out because it is more convincing than the others of course no one needs to respects opinions that bluntly deny facts such as people claiming that racism or sexism no longer exist also a commitment to basic human rights is nonnegotiable apart from that though regarding more specific claims about gender etc one has to accept that other people might hold different viewpoints might use different language etc it is through engaging with such people that everyone involved including me is encouraged to use their reason question their opinions and refine and strengthen them not through devaluing others because they are too stupid or evil to see the light men will of their own accord gradually work their way out of barbarism so long as artificial measures are not deliberately adopted to keep them in it kant what is enlightenment 
the progressives always looking out for another soul to add to the victim hood list
oh dear i think that by and large nature has already demarcated women in a rather definitive and emphatic way anatomically whatever language leftists prefer to adopt among themselves what next must we refer to flying birds out of special consideration for emus jeez anatomically trans women are much closer to cis women than men for christs sake im not going to go round referring to people who are blatantly women as men just because ideologues like you cant grasp the idea that someone can cross from one to the other
will the left never learn
its like that white women in americawho indentifies as blackshe says race is a political label and doesnt existso gender doesnt existrace doesnt existwhat the fuck does exist anymoremoral relativism is a cancer
she was accused of and of equivocating over the fact that trans women are women maybe she could see the point from more than one side and recognised its not a all or nothing answer but perhaps has nuance applying a bit of thought to the issue rather than holding and entrenched view on one extreme or the other
hmm that was actually true too about someone i knew as a teenager who wore them might be a doctor by now too
i wish to retain my right to make an internal distinction between born women and transexual women i a world where we are permanently told to embrace how different we are here we are not to go figure
before there was needlessly obfuscatory language there were other terms available to all common courtesy civility kindness to give ourselves degrees in linguistics in order to point out the failings of others does not contribute to advancing any one of our causes robert hughes said political correctness is a way of seizing the moral high ground without having to do any of the work any term or terms which serves as a way to constantly point out your own virtue in contrast to some other person or party is kind of dubious imo
thats a big straw churchill youve just constructed there are some perfectly valid criticisms that can be leveled at churchill just as there are against lenin but context is always important its a mistake to embody your hopes or fears in any individual as power seldom exists in a vacuum
some people still havent worked this out
youre 
you feel she wanted to add the words our dear leader and teacher before lenin
think your less privileged than me eh starts to saw own head off
in some ways the lefts insistence on using complicated terms to define the world is a reaction to the fact that it is politically marginalised rubbish this was about for as long as i can remember even when the left were not long out of power and were still on the left its happened as the left became focused on middle class interests only and is completely in line with s academic bullshit the left dont need to stop it with this shit because it confuses the stupid they need to stop it because its stupid
i completely agree
i am certain that there is also subtle racism coming from those shouting the loudest about racism in other people see here for an example httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrrbxzgwcdgs
a kind of gender privilege which is probably not recognised at all by the cis women who clean the guardians offices when everyone else has gone home
well illustrated some of that had never occurred to me i see cultural appropriation as racist though not deserving of the same treatment say as the forty some rockets in edinburgh on saturday impact not intent and all that
the lefts great moral strength used to be its absolute commitment to treat and give a voice to all in society equally equality of opportunity equality of esteem the only moral strength the left ever had was wages hours conditions housing and health care the rest is ersatz bullshit the rope with which the left is hanging itself gloriously
gtgtfor the answer we can turn to leninltlt as soon as you find yourself referencing dictators who oversaw regimes which caused the death of millions you should probably hit delete
he was not as bad as hitler by the time he died he was considerably worse than hitler was at the same point in history
the regressive left strikes again
something along the lines of considering yourself to be female in personality or mind as distinct from being physically female
the human race has decided to self destruct using politics religion and stupidity as the weapons of self infliction its nobodys fault with everyone blaming everyone elseheyits everybodys fault we all contribute to the insanity the right blames the left christians blame the muslims blah blah blah we all suckand when or if we decide to all get along because were all on this small planet together we will implode and its happening as i write
how then to ensure that leftwing politics remain accessible without neutralising the ability of our movement to identify oppression it would be useful to have a recognized central authority assign privilege scores that can be used in everyday political discussion for example my privilege score is  points below yours so you should be respectful shut up and listen to me
i think if youve lived in the world as a man with the privileges that the world accords to men and then sort of change gender its difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning as a woman and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are jenni murray said something similar however did a transwoman really live as a man
lol
the bankruptcy of identity politics is highlighted by the fact that noone bothers to interrogate adichies underlying claim that to be male is automatically to be privileged instead preferring to have an entirely selfreferencing spat about language orthodoxy
so basically youve learned nothing from what people even people who could be sympathisers are telling you exactly
in many important ways the experiences of everyone overlaps with everyone
we just need to explain
my eightyear old daughter used the phrase microaggression yesterday i am going to parents evening in a minute and will be asking her teacher who exactly put this language into her head i am not willing to have my children politically indoctrinated by zealot teachers
equivocating over the fact that trans women are women she didnt seem to think it was a fact at all
mansplaining transphobia islamophobia intersectionality privilege reparations diversity cultural appropriation ditch it all it is divisive and used to shut down debate and discussion shouting your opponent down does not actually win the debate
its just a highbrow way of saying personal anecdote an attempt to get people to listen and believe
i dont believe anyone is saying you cannot call yourself a woman
well thats true of everyone no its not think of it like the intolerance that existed and still exists for some regarding different religions or the complete lack some people cant stand the idea of people converting to other faiths or just leaving there are plenty of people out there that disagree with this position and are happy enough to let people believe whatever they like why should anyone be accepting of racism who gets to decide what is racist some people view cultural appropriation as a form of racism others dont there are some things that are plainly just bigotry and should be opposed who gets to decide what it bigotry and what isnt should we bring back blasphemy laws
why do we not take her words at face value and perhaps even listen to them what you appear not to understand is that adichie is prey to incorrect thoughts she needs to be put in a study group where she can be corrected its an irony almost certainly lost on ohagan that she es lenin approvingly in this article
this conversation will close shortly thank you for your contributions
simply making shit up isnt education or philosophy neither is constant whinging demands that people believe your garbage mock footy all you like its brought a hell of a lot more happiness and friendship to billions of humans than every single bit of whinging identity politics put together ever has
i see it as people wanting a cause to fight i would say we the west is fairly liberal and gender neutral having changed a great deal in recent times yet people want to find a cause where they are on the side of the moral good and need an enemy to fight to prove the cause invent the enemy and build the cause
ringfence cis women oh dear i think that by and large nature has already demarcated women in a rather definitive and emphatic way anatomically whatever language leftists prefer to adopt among themselves what next must we refer to flying birds out of special consideration for emus jeez
how then to ensure that leftwing politics remain accessible without neutralising the ability of our movement to identify oppression for the answer we can turn to lenin this is a bit like john mcdonnell throwing the copy of the little red book across the despatch box even if you think its going to be helpful just dont do it
the whole point of the left is to be different from the ordinary and there was me thinking that the left was meant to be the home of the masses the proletariat the humble worker by definition the ordinary manwomantransetc individual maybe that explains the lack of political success the left doesnt want to be ordinary it doesnt want to be of the massesim not sure lenin would agree though
i reject it too i dont identify with sex stereotypes geez
the left now is middle class dominated narrow minded to alternative views incredibly pious pretty rude pretty out of touch and pretty self centred language is part of the problem but the bigger issue is that its only interested in talking to itself
more or less hilarious is their code word for totally distressing as far as i can gather
if it has come from chemistry i think its as simple as cis is the opposite of trans
exactly another labour lurch to the right after a brief stint at kidding on at being left loses them members whodathunkit not discriminating against trans women or people of colour does not turn off the kinds of people who want to use slurs to describe people they were never winnable
education philosophy all such crap why doesnt everyone just pay the landlord with all the money the boss paid you waste the lonely remaining moments watching the footy and agree with murdoch that we should pay less tax instead of less rent
i will support it so long as it has the moral high ground interesting who defines what feminism is and who it is for is germaine greer not a feminist any more
almost certainly not
im not totally sure what gaslighting is so please bring me up to speed on that i can only guess as to how you mean it the question of if a trans person is a woman depends on how you define being a woman people can have different opinions on the answer to that calling that opinion bigoted or an abuse is ridiculous
ancient rome cisalpine gaul and transalpine not exactly common parlance though is it
make that attitude
well i have a couple of degrees in engineering and a degree in classics i struggle with the language and having tried to read about intersectionality and giving up having lost the will to live i came to the conclusion that it takes a special kind of mind to keep on ploughing through it still it takes all types etc
mus it is all about the lefts ability to build a movement
the only latitude that will be changed by reducing the term woman to a set of sexist stereotypes and gender roles is that sexism will increase
 hilarious videos of animals being torturedwait seriously
exactly another labour lurch to the right after a brief stint at kidding on at being left loses them members whodathunkit not discriminating against trans women or people of colour does not turn off the kinds of people who want to use slurs to describe people they were never winnable
words such as intersectionality alienated women like us aka women from low income backgrounds i like reading these intelligent articles but i think youve confused aka also known as and ie for example
growing up as a man doesnt give you male privilege finally someone acknowledges it
the analogy doesnt work black and asian women are female cis is a made up term meant to denote a female who identifies with the gender assigned to her at birth this statement is a nonsense what does it even mean it sounds pretty sexist to me what woman identifies with gendered sex roles and stereotypes
do you really believe the experiences of your average woman and transwoman are similar im not sure they are
however do their experiences overlap in a way that is pertinent to the tenets of feminism yes if you believe that feminism in any way relates to equality
im not sure that it is merely a problem of the internet left the problem is inherent in identity politics of whatever stripe if people are encouraged to believe that their politics should be a function of some arbitrary protected characteristic then there will necessarily be political conflict between the different group identities and there is nothing like a good infight for the left what is more identity politics is self defeating if people keep saying that sharing a characteristic determines a common interest and that interest is different from all those that do not share it then there is a chance that everyone else might believe them could you get more divisive
they can call themselves whatever they want call themselves the great god marmaduke for all i care the problem is the whinging demands that others use their made up garbage terminology um no thanks deal with it
i voted remain but i frequently find myself defending brexiters from the astonishing hatred posted on here
on the one hand you have the lamentable daily mail and its moronic fixation with ample cleavage and hilarious videos of animals being torturedon the other you have the guardian which mixes the occasionally enlightening article with barrages of absolutely offthechart batshitcrazinessis there a newspaper for sane people anywhere
a discussion so far up it own xxsx using made up language and politics and stances its just a laugh really when you stand back and read what they are arguing about i guess it passes the time but its not clever its not academic its not of any value
the arc of moral courage appears to be at an intersectionwhich of these words might be befuddling and to whom httpwwwbirminghamacukdocumentscollegeartslawcorpusconferencearchivespaperpdf
oh i get it this was published four days early by mistake doh
but we can blame churchill for the weather which caused the bengal famine though apparently oh look somebody has implied that churchill was a genocidal dictator another of the lefts language orthodoxies is that anyone who disagrees is a fascist nazi etc and that churchill used chemical weapons tier gas frequently used against rioters not agent orange as is implied
and the underground buses and cars i presume the protestor is planning to walk to work in future
this article attempts to rationalise orwellian word mangling theres a sense of  prophesy so by limiting language or its use you can take away all those nasty thoughtsthe ugly ambiguous humanly flawed ones that amount to other peoples opinions why isnt the white woman who identifies as black as worthy of having her identity respected as a trans woman and why cant i as a white male legitimately sneer at the term cis oh i can thats ok then
it depends how the navel identifies
we dont need to abandon our language because it isnt instantly recognisable to most people we just need to explain it so basically youve learned nothing from what people even people who could be sympathisers are telling you if plan a doesnt work youre going to give them some more plan a language orthodoxy is just a device to allow the incrowd who understand the jargon to demonstrate how superior they are to the masses who dont but instead of saying teach us please oh great ones the bulk of the population just switches off the identity politics lefts problem is then that it thinks the problem lies with the population rather than itself
decided to look up cis definitions according to merriam webster it relates to chemistry as follows characterized by having certain atoms or groups of atoms on the same side of the longitudinal axis of a double bond or of the plane of a ring in a molecule cisgender same source someone whose internal sense of gender corresponds with the sex the person was identified as having at birth the origin of the term cis derives from latin meaning on this side so you could be cis about all sorts of things from supporting spurs to voting remain i have to admit that the chemistry definition was less than illuminating for me
a look at those lefties telling us what words were allowed to use thought police pc gone mad b sorry you arent allowed to call yourself a woman because ive decided looking like one and having a vagina isnt good enough
true i dont identify with the sex stereotypes imposed onto females im not a masochist
no a feminist wouldnt know a joke if it grabbed them etc etc
similarly cis is a useful shorthand word to name a kind of gender privilege which is barely recognised in mainstream culture as even existing probably because it doesnt exist people who have no problem with the gender they were assigned at birth are not gender privileged theyre just statistically normal by a huge margin transgender people do have problems with the gender they were assigned at birth but there is no logical way this can imply that nontransgender people are beneficiaries of some sort of privilege
oh so are you one of the yeah but hitler built loads of roads and got everyone into work brigade
im an organic chemist cis and trans are geometric isomers of alkenes or cycloalkanes as far as im concerned
yes thats the reclamation i mentioned anyone explicitly outside those groups using that language would find out pretty quickly that it is unacceptable
the left that ohagan refers to here is not a homogenous group or movement from my perspective she seems to be referring to a mediaoriented culturebased clique with little or no political awareness or ideology beyond a desire to fit in with an obnoxious sounding clique
it is a bullshit word that should be ignored
i think she should change her name to chimawomanda ngozi adichie she doesnt know what its like to live as a man so her name should reflect that
agree i am not stupid but couldnt fathom a word she was saying how on earth are labour and the left supposed to win back the working classes when they speak such twaddle as this
ok heres a choice for you you can have beethovens fifth hamlet the long goodbye owen jones or richard littlejohn and bertrand russell ill have the flushing toilet modern dentistry penicillin the eradication of polio and the mri scanner oh yes and a mclaren s is that all right
all the great structures of the world are brought to you by the engineer the great silent comedian buster keaton was inspired by the art of engineering what a narrow view
hilarious buttoo many people such as university dons take this kind of stuff all too seriously they need to be laughed at hard not pussyfooted around
its supposed to mean anyone who identifies with the gender thy were assigned at birth whatever that means why are you struggling with it am i superintelligent or something i wasnt aware of this word until about five years ago i learned what it meant understood that i myself come under that definition and moved on i dont see why its so difficult
thank you very much
better than any other time in history given what we are being allowed to do through the meeting on non authoritarian minds in the past we always were what others told us we were without our consent where perhaps our lords and masters have woken up to the fact happier people are more productive people and in general nicer to each other
even superhuman lizard overlords cant be everywhere
still better than its
how about femininemasculine nouns such as actoractress priestpriestess princeprincess etc where there are no neutral alternatives it would be sexist to adopt the masculine versions so perhaps they should all be called actresses priestesses and princesses regardless of gender if there was a real need to differentiate one could precede the term with a qualifier such as man or male so that for example one would refer to man priestesses in the same manner that the press currently refer to women priests not that such qualifiers should be routinely used why should schoolkids need to know that male queen henry viiis six spouses were all women
are you taking the piss
thats showing them
me hey wheres greg fellow office drone they went to a meeting now did my fellow office drone mean that one person greg went to a meeting or that greg and the other people in the department all went to a meeting a very poor example to the extent of being entirely irrelevant unless greg is an exotically named woman we know hes a he so your fellow drone can say he without offending anyone or being unclear had the drone spoken thus in the conversation they could only have been being deliberately difficult perhaps because of your history of throwing daft examples into conversations
interesting after reading all your responses to my assertions i must conclude you are in fact childish
in your example greg is a specific singular male therefore it would still be perfectly acceptable to refer to him as he i read the article as suggesting using they for nonspecific people who could possibly be either gender ie where is the receptionist they have gone to a meeting
grammarly is just that close to grammatical but not quite
ironically or is it paradoxically or counterfactually i cant remember any more old english had a genderless word for a person man wer was the word for man and wif for woman this persists in both dutch and german where man is often used in he sense that the queen uses one perhaps there is an old english version of she but i am not within reach of my old english grammar book thank you national trust in dutch there is hij and zij for he and she but it is completely normal to use ze for genderless reference which is the word for they interestingly dutch has two genders common for both he and she and neuter for it compare with der die das in german but although there is a common definite article for what were masculine and feminine nouns the genders are still there you have to remember that a court gives her judgment something that would catch out the unwary foreigner but gender isnt difficult to determine in german alles das schwierig ist ist feminin i am told
to take one of many absurd examples an angel is always masculine der engel even when itshe is quite clearly female my favourite is girl which for some reason takes the neuter instead of the feminine so instead of the immediately logical die mädchen the correct is das mädchen gives a whole different spin on being an it girl
mom has harry done their homework dad they has
erm hasnt they as a genderless singular been in use for years anyway eg whens the tech support engineer getting here theyll be here soon i dont know about anyone else but ive always used they to refer to any subject in such a sentence where i dont know their gender
i think shakespear would agree because he never used heshe in a sentence
i dont see the point of blaming english for being clearafter all how good is it for iranian women and society that persian is a genderless languagewhat wrongs are there in saying if john or may comes they will want to play tennis rather than the sort of silly if john or may comes heesh will want to play tennis rather than something wrong with english there may well be something rather wrong with the head of a selected few among their most graceful users
i hate to be pedantic but what you are saying is incorrect its the number 
look at his pic definately a fella in fact he looks like me with a little head
is it sexist to assume every actress is an actor
have artificial languages like esperan to solved the problem if so we could all learn that
i think it means to modify the meaning not the form the form of either word can change to agree with the other according to the rules of the language it works one way round in english and the other in french
my expresses many many relationships my father for example also has nothing to do with possession
makes sense
i run up against this problem quite regularly they singular needs a reflexive singular pronoun to go with it themself would fit the bill but it is not yet in general use so were stuck with themselves eg if anyone singular needs to lift a heavy object they genderless singular should not try to do so by themselves aargh plural themself wrong
sheeheee and i am not kidding and stuff grammarly which wants me to use are instead of am and further stuff grammarly which doesnt like my second sentence either
german is better as there is also neuter
are you a teachers you seam like onei actually think it is important to know who is teaching your kids more information is generally good my german speaking kids were very confused when they didnt know if they had a new man or woman teacherbtw their is no reason to write heshe this is easily dealt with we need to learn to live with diversity rather than hide from it diversity in all of its colours otherwise we become just numbers but perhaps that is the agenda of some
an astonishingly lazy piece of journalism someone got paid for this seriously like many commenting here ive been using they for years its wellestablished good practice in technical authoring training design etc etc etc 
we have already reached the point where preferring he to they in contexts where they sounds natural is almost always interpreted as linguistic preciosity or a signal of conservatism rather than evidence of educational attainment or careful language use
and this is an english problemwhat you mean all the romance languages like french spanish etc dont have this issue ermmm think maybe a linguistics course is called for darlin 
dear person your gender does not concern us person is a horrendously sexist term surely it should be peroffspring
ouch my ears bleed just hearing that
dear mrhumbug have you read the article it is about using a pronoun which is usually thought of as plural to refer a singular indeterminate genderyou insist on using this as an opportunity to make snide comments about feminism the mere acknowledgment of the existence of biological sexes is sexism which are completely irrelevant and nonsensical this is not clever it is insulting and worse boring
the problem with they as a singular is that the word already has a common useas a plural its not difficult to imagine scenarios where a listener wont be able to tell whether the speaker is talking about one person or multiple people lets say i walk into an office where greg and several other people in the department im part of are all away from their desks me hey wheres gregfellow office drone they went to a meeting now did my fellow office drone mean that one person greg went to a meeting or that greg and the other people in the department all went to a meeting this is relevant because if the entire group went to a meeting thats a sign that perhaps my forgetful butt is supposed to be there too so now i have to ask followup questions and communication is made less clear and efficient i dont have a problem with the idea of a genderneutral pronoun but this particular solution just creates new problems and i dont give a rats about chauncer or coleridge im more concerned about everyday general usage we either need a new word or a simpler solution just use the genderless singular pronoun we have already it it would be no more difficult to remove the convention that we dont use it for people actually we do already for babies whose sex isnt known yet than to get everyone to start using they as a singular and using it or a new word instead would be much clearer
i hope everyone has done its homework no dont think so
i like it they is cool too it feels like a collectiveofprogression when used in this inclusive fashion
they is also widely used in the us to refer to a customer etc eg if a customer comes in show them the sale items using him or her would sound bizarre in that context unless the shop catered exclusively to men or women and even then it would not be wrong to say them
thought so very good 
they is plural it is both singular and simpler and more appropriate
i agree ive honestly never heard anyone use anything but they in sentences like that
it wastes its not its intellect sorry to be fussy 
it does sound like correct usage to use male and female pronouns when you are referring to a specific person whose gender identity is clearly male or female however it is increasingly the case that they is used for specific persons who are clearly nonbinary or prefer to be referred to as they
i do agree with the plurality issue context would sort it yes but english doesnt tend to be too contextdependent as other languages are so relying on context might be unusual for this particular word but as with many words popular use would change its meaning im sure
ah now here is a topic to make cif go ballistic you are making an aesthetic judgement they is ugly and dressing it up as a moral judgement on those of us who disagree using they is lazy you are telling people who use theythem as indeterminate singular that they sound stupid even though this usage is found in chaucer shakespeare and austen do they sound stupid too the argument against theythem stems from a desire for authority in language which runs counter to its perpetual development more specifically the condemnation of theythem originates in the inappropriate application of logic by prescriptive grammarians mainly in the th century i think repetition of that doctrine by schools over the years has led to the belief that there is something unnatural about the use of theythem in the singular but language is not logical in this sense by the same token should we not also insist on using thee thy and thine or would you argue that those disappeared before english reached its perfection at some point in the th century is english handicapped because it does not have a plural indefinite article nor distinguish singular and plural in definite articles what about the rapidly changing use of prepositions when should we fix them in stone in the end these are matters of aesthetics style and clarity all of which are enmeshed with social class i find him or her wordy and inelegant you find they in the singular ugly thats fine but please dont condemn me for being incorrect and lazy because i dont conform to the rules you have chosen to foist on others i also believe that the singular use of theythem is much more common than pedants would like to accept oh someone is at the door tell them to go awaydo you really use him or her instead of them in that instance

i am beginning to think undiagnosed autism is more prevelent in the adult population than first thought given some of the comment being made in relation to this story people are just seeing what pertains to them they are viewing the idea from their own perspective not that of the society of which they are part
ive always thought that the my in my partner indicated that the person is in a relationship with the speaker rather than is possessed by them if you dont want to signal any relationship dont designate them other than by their name

re rabid the new oxford dictionary of english  gives the example rabid feminists but the publishers have made amends in the oxford advanced learners dictionary  rabid rightwing fanatics the rabid tabloid press a rabid dog
i used it in a recent publication when discussing a nonbinary person personally i find it comes across very unnatural and clumsy im much more in favour of a new pronoun such as the one used by greg egan ve ver vem when referring to someone without the use of gender

why is this supposed to be something new i thought they used as a singular had been around for ages and was perfectly acceptable english even the writer of the article es shakespeare and jane austen
ok they it is not gratuitously discriminating is in my view and practice more important than current grammar now for the next challenge lets find a word that describes a relationship without implying possession as in my partner any suggestions please
and to be equally blunt not a single person outside a university or tumblr will use this term so you may as well just belt up about itits a lovely day go enjoy the fresh air and sunshine
i adopted this usage for unspecified singulars years ago and its not uncommon this piece does seem a little cooked up and it fails to mention the pioneering work of dale spender in this arena she published man made language  years ago
instead of using language to accurately express what we wish to convey how about we jump up and down grunting and pointing until they get a vague notion of what were trying to communicate that way theres no possible risk of offending someone because theyll never really be sure of what we said
no rights as a non binary identity despite the fact the nhs is promoting it which means non binaries are forced to identify as their birth sex despite the fact many have undergone various levels of transition neutralising we call it but with the acceptance of non binary may come with many benefits as it exists as place between places a buffer zone for those that dont quite fit in where it might even come to pass the allowance of it as an alternative gender identity may even cause the nhs to save money through not having to offer transition services through people being allowed to be comfortable in their recognised identity as regards maternity leave fathers will always be fathers and mothers will always be mothers that is biology and cant be altered but it doesnt mean those of whom are fathers or mothers have to identify as men and women respectively for sex is not gender nor is it gender identity for all
mr starifa
in german there is a word which is used in a similar way to one as in one can do whatever it is man which is distinct from mann which in english means man it is very commonly used and lacks the snooty associations of the english alternative the associated possessive pronoun is masculine in german grammatical genders do not always work in accordance with human gender for example both girl mädchen and miss fräulein are neuter because of the dimunitive ending maybe one should stick with one
how do you pronounce it
some person also needs to point out to the americans that iran and iraq are not pronounced like they were apple products
i think you mean this one who describes theyself or possibly themself as a you dreadful sexist neanderthal monster
no reason why something once plural should be restricted forever to being used as a plural when the secondperson singular was thou you was strictly plural

if a person is neither male or female invent a new word let trans people decide how are we supposed to know someone is trans its not obvious or written on foreheads why they you is more adaptable

many languages have noun classes categorizing nouns into different classes that are treated grammatically different the genders in many european languages are such noun classes but those languages tend to have at most  such classes normally designated masculine feminine and where it exists neutral some languages have many more for example swahili has  noun classes
ive started using she its strangely satisfying
who the hell is they
we should perhaps send them a few copies of fowlers modern english usage
thank you for insulting my language you should let shakespeare know
i suppose you dont use the lazy i and still stick to ic do you still insist the secondperson singular is thou and dismiss the use of singular you as lazy
you hadnt heard about the referendum or the american elections then
because of the nature of grammatical gender in spanish for example i doubt very much whether this discussion would even take place if the the guardian was operating out of madrid i think that was my point a complete overhaul of a language that is otherwise upheld as examplary would be required and that just isnt going to happen see the german orthography reform the result is a selective correctness which is just silly and about the article i honestly cant remember a time when they wasnt used a nongender specific pronoun
i disagree but thanks for your amazing insight and contribution it really made me think
way to be condescending sexist and wrong all in one short sentence you should try imagining life as mrstarifa in a world where you can get killed ridiculed and discriminated against just for that extra s in your name you are clearly not a very bright boy
we live happily with you as singular and plural so i dont think this will be any different personally ive used it for years and as an efl teacher even teach it to my students

and this just sounds stupid is exactly the problem people have had specifically gendered language habits ingrained into them to the point of actual repulsion at their refusal put bluntly get the fuck over it
it may not be a perfect solution but it does help in many circumstances way better than saying he or she all the way through a document
tumblr
to be fair to berry i dont think she actually wrote that sentence the captions headlines etc are as i understand it written by the subeditor who also linked to the wrong video they included one of obama praising the eu rather than one of maria munir saying that she was nonbinary
what are people supposed to do who speak and write in grammatical gender languages do they have to continue being sexists
incidentally as the writer mentions german is the writer sorry not aware that girls and unmarried women are neuter whereas men are always male
i used to enjoy barmaids if only it had been they
one word i have started using recently is themself spellchecks hate it although some dictionaries say its ok
one pronoun to represent masculine feminine and neuter genders is it necessary to replace the pronouns being used now to think of they as a singular representative goes against the conscience of all genders the matter does not concern english alone as a language the classical languages of the world and their grammarians had understandably standardised pronouns and the pattern of verb forms that need to define the pronouns the modern age recognition accorded to feminism and the legitimacy accorded to lgbt in certain countries need not necessarily influence linguists of different languages to usher in new age pronouns the matter is best left to the evolution of languagesthemselves
yes chair has another meaning a couple in fact but that isnt as a replacement for chairman or chairwoman just for a professorship in a university those who use chair in the sense of chairman or chairwoman particularly when they actually know the sex of the person concerned are just being pc in my opinion and im rarely that
what is it about gender being specified every time a person is mentioned that makes ballads poems and novels exciting to you  i dont think youve really thought this through properly
at least in english we dont have genderised plural pronouns as they do in other latin languages because the whole idea of gender in language is wrong some things have real gender that is they are male or female and trans for the pcists here but for most nouns they are just type  and type  in french for instance victime is a feminine noun so that if a plane crashed with  men and one woman killed the victims would still be elles collectively
whenever you hear a man say that a sexist phenomenon or relic doesnt matter what they mean is whenever you hear a woman say thatwhat they mean is would you be happy if i were to autocratically decree the real meaning of what you say no then dont do it to others
with respect you ms the pointwith any plural of course its they its when its singular and indefinite sex that the question arises
how can you be an authoritywhat about she try that  sshhee
by people you mean wankers thanks i would never ever ever call anyone ms a ridiculous feminist invention which i am old enough to remember if i needed to address an unknown woman that is couldnt say mrs or miss x then id say madam
by people you mean wankers thats not a nice way to talk about my grandmother lots of women dont like ms lots of women are happy to announce to the world their marital status your attitude is really really deplorable
it matters because a lot of men and some women are heavily invested in the idea that men are neutral human beings and women are a deviation from the norm oh dear i think you need to get out more
singular they has a long and illustrious heritagehere are three examples from shakespearegod send every one their hearts desire much ado about nothing act iii scene  theres not a man i meet but doth salute meas if i were their wellacquainted friend a comedy of errors act iv scene  arise one knocks hark how they knock romeo and juliet act iii scene  and a list of examples of from jane austens writingsbrace yourself there are an awful lot of themhttpcrossmytcomhclinghebrausthlishtml
what about she is that beyond the pale
neutral gender and genderneutral is the same thing nope in terms of nouns there are in many languages at all times and in english only through the retention of the pronoun it three genders applicable the male gender the female gender and the neutral gender he she and it any noun will be one of those three genders for example in german the noun for lake and sea is the same see but a lake is masculine der see and the sea is feminine die see in english this doesnt exist for all nouns but we retain the distinction when referring to people and objects objects generally are treated as the neutral gender it but not always whereas people are assigned their actual gender otherwise the gender of nouns is moreorless nonexistent in english however what we are looking for here or at least what we are discussing is a genderneutral word that can be applied to people either male or female not a word to refer to those nouns that are of the neutral gender ie objects so it doesnt work
its not so much a whole article on the passive voice but one point of many in politics and the english language
its what i call an idiot flag
barrow persons
that seems to be about the alphabet rather than the language itself perhaps im misunderstanding it
indeed people are getting angry about the campaigners trying to bring it in i dont think its the same i wouldnt say those campaigning for change are angry as such just frustrated i read about a nursery school in sweden that was going to treat children genderneutrally and use a genderneutral pronoun and in the articles comments thread there were people getting very worked up claiming that the place would be damaging and traumatic to children
what dogmatic gender politics you do know were talking about harman dont you
soldier is a gender neutral word but i still think of men because the reality is that most soldiers are men bear in mind that men at war was my example not one from the original research
good workaround two fine alternatives that everyone can agree on the difficulty normally comes of course when you want to say more for example here i might then say they were wearing a yellow raincoat and a big hat i couldnt even work out their gender from their clothes or the shape of their body suddenly the alternatives start to sound really strange you wouldnt normally repeat a full noun phrase such as the person so much instead wed get to hear a reduced noun phrase and in this case its pronouns but anyway its still personal taste and this particular example is probably uncommon its based on an actual reallife occurrence though the funny thing is that everyone on this thread will now suddenly start seeing and hearing the singular they being used all over the place
that sentence is correct a lot is a singular thing and so it is correct to say here is a lot of people alternatively i could have said there are many people
strange i use they and assumed that this was commonly regarded as the correct way of doing things the phrase he or she is just mealy mouthed and clumsy and to use he when referring to a female or a group containing females is apart from anything else inaccurate
have you read nineteen eightyfour didnt it come top in a list of books most people claimed to have read but in fact hadnt httpwwwtheguardiancombooksbooksblogsephaveyoueverliedaboutabook

ok kiz uniformity within the house means less work for editors and people outside have a measure of freedom but you will agree that one or two reservations are possible absolute uniformity in behaviour among the citizenry would make things easier for the police too while such a state of affairs is one that nobody wants as for those who are not journalists well the freedom of a freelance writer to write english as he learned it in school is today curtailed in all probability he will be subject to inhouse rules or his text will be amended with oxford commas aggressively deleted and their inserted where the writer has used his i have nothing against the autonomous evolution of a language and we have to accept it in any case what i oppose is the authoritarianism of those who wish to hurry evolution in a certain direction
femail please please tell me that is just a typo
soldier is a gender neutral word but i still think of men because the reality is that most soldiers are men warfare is a completely different word it refers to the act that soldiers carry out and then i think of the consequencies of that action as well as the people doing it
no thanks for clarifying
i seem to remember it being trendy in germany to say frau meint instead of man meint there being two v similar but different words in german mann meaning male person and man meaning one a la princess anne frau of course means female person please tell me they have stopped doing this
what does it say about the french that they seem happy with madame and mademoiselle mademoiselle no longer appears on government forms there is now a campaign by some women to bring it back plus ça change
anglers fish with rods fishermen and fisherladies fish with nets
dear citizen citizen was used both by soviet officialdom grazhdanin and the original tv batman gentlemen with a footnote that one uses the particle man in its original germanic sense to mean human being appalacian english has a neutral possessive hit usually used for animals of indeterminate gender all of which are more strained and unnatural than the authors suggestion im sticking with they
using she instead of they is a bit whiny in itself no
the common usage is now could care less its perhaps a common usage but its not yet the common usage
lionel  october  pm  ive no idea the only newspaper style guide ive looked at is the graun but unless youre a journalist your point has little relevance for you as you are not dictated to by the house styles of any publishing entity that publishing entities give their staff style guides is entirely understandable and very helpful as it saves confusion for writers and less work for eds
yes that bit and then i pointed out that james thurber a hugely accomplished writer who worked for the new yorker when harold ross was editing it a copy of fowlers modern english usage in either hand thought that his or her coat was a bit precious and pedantic coming from a victorianera schoolmarm
bojangles
it is not being taken away what an absurd thing to say not quite true in my opinion for example how many papers would allow you to use the oxford comma if you were on the staff
lionel  october  pm  you dont have to so no need for the melodrama
exactly choice you do have that choice but to be honest reading your other comments you dont seem so keen for other people to exercise their choice
zhrskih  october  pm  one small step for a man a giant leap for humanity
mancuniensis  october  pm  it is still in common usage but plenty of people including me think it sexist and use other words instead i have that choice
but they is becoming more and more common and has been an entirely acceptable alternative for yonks maybe so but im not a yonk and have no intention of becoming one
they has a longer history as a gender neutral singular pronoun than he something introduced in the th century in an attempt to change the status quo three centuries later both are still in use and both acceptable under the status quo you seem to be advocating for even with all those nasty innovators trying to stamp its use out or claim its some modern pc nonsense
meh
i cant stand the use of he as gender neutral because clearly its not i dont know what the latin term might be for an argument that is from one side but thats what this is i wonder how you would respond to the following i cant stand the use of they as number neutral because clearly its not
the traditional remedy still advocated by many armchair grammarians has been to treat everyone as if they were male and use he to cover both or resort to clumsy constructions such as he or she or hisher that bit
lionel  october  pm  it is not being taken away what an absurd thing to say the generic he is still used by plenty of dinosaurs but they is becoming more and more common and has been an entirely acceptable alternative for yonks
thank you the doors over there
bonechina  october  pm  yes it does actually because marsh really is an excellent writer on language issues extremely sensible very erudite and very interesting
but you would admit that mankind is in common use and not generally regarded as sexist
tcrislington  october  pm  no you are stating that it simply feels wrong as a fact that applies to everyone when you mean just you its your opinionit simply feels entirely natural to me
mrtarifa  october  pm  your entire post is a master class in the art of the non sequitur
mancuniensis  october  pm  no i use humanity because to my mind it denotes all humans human is gender nonspecific manmankind are not
term for a female fisherman fisheresss term for a mixedgender group of people who fish anglers
troedchwitharfon  october  pm  nope its changed the common usage is now could care less to mean couldnt care less i used it quite deliberatelyi love english usage or american in this instance its potty
the ugly thing about your argument is simply this david that you are in favour of depriving the lover of english of an option he or she used to have when i was a child back in the th century if you like i was taught that the gender of he and his etc depends on context in one case masculine in another neutral it was my option to adhere to this convention or to drop it i was free to say he or she and to adopt the rest of the english today used in newspapers fused participles included if i wanted to but today that freedom is being taken away we havent yet reached the stage at which a contributor to cif will be hunted down by the authorities and incarcerated if he writes for example everyone will be required to have his own notebook but we are headed that way and when it happens it will be consistent with the general drift toward outright suppression that is today visible around us
yorkerbouncer  october  pm  youd have a point if this was a feminist blog its a language blog david writes about english usage so it would be flat out weird if he started writing about the issue of abortion in el salvador you could go and suggest the topic to jane martinson over on the womens blog if you like see life and style pages under womenhope this helps
so you wouldnt say mankind to describe the lot of us
mrtarifa  october  pm  no not every he or she the generic he or she whoever comes in next he or she will be given a prize this is very awkward language the way round it is to use they
skipissatan where it mangles language shouldnt that be mangles or womangles
mancuniensis  october  pm  know it doesnt at all because this is an obsolete meaning of the word beware of false etymology or youll be telling me that dilapidated means taking the stones out nextthe meaning of the word man in english is for the male person and even when it is used as the generic term for everyone or humanity people still think of menlanguage is a way of describing how we think when i want to describe all people i dont use the word man becuase that is not what it denotes to me so i use words that i think appropriate lots of other people do the same thing and the language changes it then reflects the world we live in which is not norman
i think youll find that you couldnt care less
on the bbc website theres a story about women in el salvador going to prison because theyre deemed to have aborted children when theyve actually miscarried but the law does not allow exceptions meanwhile on one of the major news websites in the uk were debating whether using he is sexist do you ever wonder whether feminism has lost its way
marsh after ing a few lines from l carroll shakespeare thackeray the bible king james translation goes on to say if they can do it so can youbut i like other native english speakers already was doing it should i provide an opposing list of ations from those authors and would mr marsh accept it if i did the point is there are contexts where they sounds right even though we know we are talking about a single person other contexts where it does not and david marsh ought in my opinion to respect these factsit is sometimes better to be unfashionable but to write something that posterity will agree with and approve than to leap on every passing bandwagon
monarch indeed yes
knowing what we know now it is deliberately obtuse and obscure to call george elliot an author instead of an authoress and if you believe the gender of the writer does not inform their writing or is relevant to the reader and youre wrong about doctors on this page there is a lady doctor who states many of her patients ask for a lady doctor in certain circumstances how much simpler it would be if there were one word that replaced that clumsy construction
troedchwitharfon  october  pm  in greek theres a masculine and feminine form for dogs and cats i refer to my girl cat with the feminine form and a tom would get the masculine
i questioned whether given your examples they would have been well aware the word man was being used in a generic sense well again i havent read it so i cant be sure but id say that it would be easy to tell if they only used male images then you might think theyd interpreted the words that way but if they used predominantly male images then that would imply they were interpreting the words generically but being consciously or unconsciously influenced by the masculine noun thats pretty much what hofstadter meant when he talked about the slippery slope of sexism the masculine noun can slip back and forward between generic and specific but the feminine is always specific imagine theyd been asked to collect images on woman at war there would be no ambiguity at all
hurriedly and inadvertently installed their vaginas the wrong way round resulting in a backtofront bottom it must be friday afternoon
all of these terms have genderneutral equivalents though him her them his hers theirs man woman person the more interesting problem i think is in finding a gender neutral equivalent of sir madam when writing to someone of unknown gender ive always used dear sirmadam but a previous comment mentioned comrade which gives me an excellent idea dear comrade which has the bonus of annoying those on the right which is lets face it always satisfying
has anyone ever seen the simpsons episode called girls just want to have sums edna krabappel are you saying that men and women are identicalskinner oh no of course not women are unique in every waylindsey naegle now hes saying men and women arent equalskinner no no no its the differences of which there are none that makes the sameness exceptional just tell me what to say later skinner all i know is that no one is better than anyone else and everyone is the best at everything
peppermintish  october  pm  no of course not
the queen on first mention queen being her role not her title monarch
did you see the remarks atl about the traditional remedy still advocated by many armchair grammarians
certainly would have been very memorable
mrtarifa  october  pm  you wouldnt know even if they did keep the word authoress george elliott was an author but not a heand stating the sex of a person doing the job isnt really descriptive either or only in the most banal kind of way because generally speaking its not information thats pertinent if i need a doctor i dont care about their sex or gender only their skills
thanks for the reference to the research and yes youre right that these subjects can be interpreted differently but in many ways thats the entire point but in your post to which i replied you wrote those given the gendered subjects despite the fact that they were well aware the word man was being used in a generic sense used far more male images in their scrapbooks than the others i questioned whether given your examples they would have been well aware the word man was being used in a generic sense i can see the examples as being cases where one person might intend them to have the same meaning while others might interpret them differently so industrial man might be intended to mean looking at humans as industrial but might be taken to mean something more like a man male human who is industrial but that wouldnt be a case where they were well aware the word man was being used in a generic sense as intended all this reminds me of the pioneer plaques which showed a man with his hand raised in greeting while the woman just stood there
i have not come across it in the translation circles here in brussels but i will keep my eyes and ears open there is always a first time
but try talking about your cousins in english it will be assumed that you are talking about the male and female cousins when in other languages you could differentiate as you do with brothers and sistersin welsh its cefnder and cyfnitheralso in welsh dogs are masculine and cats femininechairs are feminine tables masculine etc etc
errrrrr because thats what the article is all about the author of winniethepooh thought he or she should be replaced by heesh
zhrskih  october  pm  its a common typo its probably just a typo i do wish people wouldnt correct typos its a comment forum not a bloody university
mancuniensis  october  pm  oh and the issue of the generic he as sexist language reinforcement most certainly does come up in efl circles both on the teaching and publishing side as many issues to do with usage linguistics and language development come up too
why not simply does everyone have their coat in that context
mancuniensis  october  pm  well you cant simply baldly state that the use of the generic isnt sexist using because i say so as the supporting evidencethere is plenty of evidence that the use of the generic he is not seen as gender nonspecific and that it actually favours attitudes to men and boysfinally the use of they as a generic doesnt only apply to legal documents i use it in all instances of language use formal informal written and spoken its a completely accepted usage and very common ive been using it since i was eleven as its easier
female and not a native speaker i cant be sure whether i was taught singular they at uni or not but i have no qualms whatsoever about using it and nobodys ever made a comment on it as long as your english is fine otherwise i dont see why people would assume its a mistakeon that topic its mistake for not as i will sometimes use he or she instead of they but never his or her instead of their that just becomes too clumsy
miss mrs and ms are all short for mistress which was and is the equivalent of mister by this logic i intend to simply call myself miss for the rest of my life makes things easier that said i worked as a receptionist once taking peoples details i would never had dared ask if a woman was miss or mrs unless she volunteered the information herself i wouldnt ask a man that sort of question after all so everyone i entered was all ms since thats the accepted neutral term only one person ever complained
can i recommend you twice 
or indeed thats one small step for me but a giant leap for all of us
yep monperson wifmon female person wapmon male person bloody norman invasion screwed up a perfectly good language
and certainly make matters obscure if a female author isnt described as an authoress how can we tell if evelyn waugh is male or female ditto actress poetess all useful words that are disappearing theyre not sexist theyre descriptive
i thought the suffix man meant person in anglosaxon that indefinite pronoun means one people they it does but unfortunately you wont get any recommends for pointing it out here because it tends to kybosh some of the arguments about sexist use of language
ok i got as far as there is a lot of people 
and that moonlanding how much more memorable still if neil had dared to say thats one small step for a person but a giant leap for personkind
why do we need to differentiate between the genderssexes anyway it is almost never relevant apart from to discriminate against women obviously this reminds me of an old eddie izzard sketch where he said that everything no matter how cool if you go too far becomes uncool smoking a cigarette cool smoking two cigarettes at once uncool or something like that similarly making pronouns genderindependent cool eliminating the possibility of gender differentiation uncool imagine im telling a story with a man and a woman in it how do i refer to one rather than the other without constantly using their names it becomes unwieldylike the americans say about freedom of speech the only solution to bad speech isnt to restrict free speech its more free speech similarly the solution here isnt to eliminate words but to find a word that expresses the precise idea were searching for and leaving the other words as they are to refer to their own ideas
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language absolute bollocks every word ed has had its meaning changed to the opposite of what it used to be there are others nice originally meant precise or neat silly used to mean happy blissful lucky or blessed from there it came to mean innocent or deserving of compassion only later mutating this sense of naive childishness into a more critical mocking term signifying ignorance feeblemindedness and foolish behaviour the meaning we know today for you
nope its from a greek word meaning finding out but nice try
me too rabid means mad dog to me and i suspect most other people too
why do you think that being a secretary was any easier before wwi than after if a job has status and a good wage then its a mans job once a woman starts doing it then it pays less offers less respect and its easy like teaching
in all the ancient mythologies i am familiar with a goddess is always ultimately subservient to god even my spell checker insists on a capital for god but does without on goddess i have just discovered i will happily stand corrected
grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens thats just plain silly men s and womens voices are different in pitch and timbre if youre being pejorative about someones voice you will use shrill about a woman and gruff about a man
oh ive given up on feminism im just rooting for equality these days
i must object that a publication of note would allow the use of the word actress it should be actor shame on the author and the grauniad
this wasnt done in his leisure time he gets paid for it
we seem to be passed that point in the uk though girls believe they are cleverer better behaved and try harder than boys from the age of four research suggests by the age of eight boys had also adopted these perceptions the study from the university of kent found
his story 
since men are still the prototype humans you dont need to modify words such as maintenance man chairman congressman janitor athlete president etc if the position comes with power and a good wage it needs a modification if a woman is doing it chairwoman congresswoman female janitor woman soldier etc if someone says jockey you picture a man if someone says boardmember you picture a man as for the curse of male violence the curse of female violence sounds awfully silly
i have a problem offered the word rabid i immediately thought of a dog with rabies does this mean that i am an caninist
in  it was a dictionary that made me aware of the ingrained prevalence of sexism while looking up a word while composing a letter i came across spinster the male equivalent being bachelor one of those words has more of a pejorative connotation than the other doesnt it there a other word pairs where the word assigned to a female role is more negative such as witch and wizard slut and stud bitch and dog etc if there was such a difference in words assigned to different ethnic groups thered be an uproar over it but sexism is so much part of our culture its relatively overlooked at the time there were no books i could find that objectively studied this phenomena but only biographical accounts of victims of sexism
good article but it doesnt reveal the sexism at the heart of our language which is itself a loaded and misleading metaphor it reveals a long history of cultural and deep psychological sexism that sexism isnt in the language as this article shows we make a habit of taking otherwise unloaded words innocent ones pure of heart and turning them to misogynistic purposes often within a generation or two the same is of course true of homophobia dont blame the language the problem is us
then stop speaking writing and reading english
i can explain to you that the guardian finds sexism and discrimination everywhere the way a schizophrenic hears voices all the time the only conclusion one can reach is that to eliminate sexism in the language we must return to prehistoric inarticulate grunting
a sex worker is not always a prostitute but a prostitute is always a sex worker that being said im all for calling a prostitute a prostitute
why does it matter whether or not the words are at the heart of the language the problem is that they exist and people incorporate them within their psyche
i havent heard male nurse or female doctor used in years
one could almost call it a tempest i hope your writing such as it is has been confined to sports reports or the pamphlets they give out at the dog pound
i think thats called a lobotomy
arent there occupations which are only masculine in french for which you also need to resort to that same awful expression what about ingénieur there is no ingénieuse
prostitute are is just a word sex worker sounds too clinical like the person hired to inflate penile balloon implants ill just go with my ladies of the evening thank you
editor would be sexist because ed is a mans name and they did use an editor from the th century
gt grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices gt not mensgtand why might that be its like asking why a violin can be squeaky but not a cello
and of course theres no sexist words in other languages what a load of crap about nothing
i think youre using an archaic definition of editor nowadays it refers to a political gatekeeper of a publications agenda
at least english doesnt have genderspecific articles as does spanish or german i sit on the chair its not a she or a he which is ridiculous to english speakers
not a linguist i see apparently not fluent in any other language that uses genders either
women out to have gt women ought to have this incompetence gives away daves gender to anyone with any shred of doubt
why are you saying that to you all iranians are the same racist
what gender is the word amoeba
for instance the only times ive heard words like hussy and madam being used it has almost always been women talking disparagingly about other women as in shes a proper little hussy etc i had a similar thought all the way through this article elsewhere we are constantly told and i have no reason to doubt this that women on the whole tend to have greater linguistic skill than men and this is often backed up by the idea that women are born with superior hardware for this purpose the wernicke and broca areas are apparently significantly better developed in women and these are associated with language skill also there is no doubt that in our very earliest years on average we male and female tend to be taught language more by by women than by menthen in whatever power struggle is ongoing between the sexes women out to have the advantage in the language area as the article points out human language is in large part a creation of its human speakers on the other hand perhaps one could argue that this skill advantage in language is what enabled women to talk david shariatmadari around to enlisting himself as a linguistic foot soldier for the female cause
and apologies for spelling mr shariatmadaris name wrong its been a long day and i fixed his name wrongly in my tired mind
peoples ability to even conceive sexist thoughts needs to be abolished all language should be agreeable with progressive ideals and all communication however expressed a reaffirmation of these ideals
thats the point there is no pejorative term for an unmarried man of marriageable age or older
what a thin article the whole case is based on a few words that are hardly used nowadays it would be a good idea if the guardian had someone who checks and appraises what its journalists write maybe we could call them an editor
i find a good screw more riveting
because there never was such a thing as a goddess
what do you think a hysterectomy is and the word hysterical was plenty pejorative it was probably some aggrieved bloke with wounded pride who first used emasculate in figurative rather than literal terms
the problem is that they are churning out clickbait we should ignore it but its unfair on younger readers who may be developing their critical faculties ive been there looking for sexism in the wrong places is unproductive who are they fooling
there certainly do seem to be a lot of words in english depicting women as shrews and harridans i wonder how much of this is historical and cultural during the middle ages when pilgrimages were the preferred means of recreational travel englishwomen were unwelcome on the continent according to william manchester in a world lit only by fire this was because they had the reputation of having the foulest mouths in christendom
oh no history just happens to have been predominantly malecentric and now we have the delicious luxury of applying stc standards to the language of people long dead huzzah
ive just spent the last hour discussing this article with my sorry about the possessive wife sorry about the gender specific term she is a language phd and whilst she advances the argument that in a patriarchal society language itself is inherently patriarchal she finds the conclusion expressed here a stretch at best her words not mine and in particular the contention that in terms of historical perspective the trend is negative david shadamartaris implication when relating language to social condition and i have to agree this implication is that the social condition of women has deteriorated in line with the meanings of the words surely the opposite is true women are no longer chattels have equal rights in law which was not the case in shakespearechaucers time can own property vote the same as men etc etc finally some of these words are a stretch at best if we are talking about modern english madam is inferior to sir hardly ever and in the overwhelming majority of cases has parity as a polite form of addresshussy or wench i have never heard these words used in any other context than ironic or historical fictiongovernor hasnt this become gender neutral in that the governor of eg north dakota arizona california etc is not assumed to be a man merely by the use of the term and could equally be a woman in short david shadamartari might well have a point but he hasnt illustrated or argued it well
well you might think that ensconced in some pretty little village in some remote part of the auld country where nothing much has changed since  or youre delusionary in the colonies the bachelor and spinsters balls as the more or less equivalent of debutante balls says otherwise further there is no sense in which bachelor connotes virgin in the same way as the etymology of maiden and maid carry
what a waste of time thinking about the ways in which women are oppressed through language we should just spend our time oppressing women instead
can someone explain why a selection of eight words most of which are not in common contemporary usage and none of which is free from a certain mustiness use almost any of them and you sound like grandma can be indicative of sexism at the heart of a language isnt it actually the case that after the usage of these words changed they dropped in popularity and what about bachelor are you seriously saying that outside reality tv it doesnt have a negative ring to it unless preceded by eligible
you know me so well and i imagine are never incorrect a perfect example of a thoroughly modern woman
lady macbeth called on spirits to unsex her ie make her less of a woman meaning strip her of compassion and gentleness emasculate tends to be used in the sense of becoming less masculine not less powerful the fact that there is not a precise pair of words doesnt seem to me to mean anything
rabid feminist yet another term that reveals the sexism at the heart of the english language
do you realise there is such a thing as a male prostitute
hooray someone with some sense
to describe a woman as a tart was to pay her a compliment in australia until a few decades ago in the late s it still meant she was a good sort in queensland
the progressive party was an independent party formed by former president teddy roosevelt in  it consisted of leftwing former republicans i suspect that democrats have resurrected the word progressive because todays republicans have been so successful at blackening the word liberal in the public arena in any case todays democrats are far more kindred to teddys progressive party than are todays rightwing republicans
referencing why use a noun as a verb when a satisfactory verbal form already exists ie refer if thats not quite what you meant whats wrong with plain simple mentioning
in which of these categories would you place the author
what youre really arguing for is newspeak this version of the english language is purged of words and expressions that convey undesirable meaning obviously you cant introduce it overnight it has to be done in stages but i dare say the party does have an implementation plan while were about it we can also purge history of undesirable references to people and events that wed rather forget about because they dont fit with contemporary orthodoxy
women have lots of natural power but men have created a society that tries to thwart it feminism simply calls for equal treatment a society that creates and maintains language to demean women does not represent equal worth or treatment for them this is not some kind of imagined oppression yes there are lots of nice roles for women these days in the west at least just as men have a nicer life in general in the west at present than they did in the past and we need to be thankful for that yet the psychological onslaught of sexism has not ceased

eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language at the heart of the english language seriously what rubbish the highly selective and narrow premise of this article illustrates again the petty extremes some will go to get in print the fact that it was published here demonstrates the unwillingness of the guardian to present a diverse view on anything shame on you guardian i love the guardian i despise singleminded leftysexism claptrap that makes  
very interesting idea id say that emasculation represents taking something from a man and feminization also applies to men i dont think i know of an equivalent to emasculation for women victorian anti feminists used to say that certain activities education sports owning property and voting would unsex women and in my youth after the victorian period a few people still talked about women losing their femininity as if theyd dropped it somewhere but thats an interesting contrast
these words are only hurtful if you choose to be hurt who would of thought bunch was so bad
true freedom and equality for women can only come with the abolition of religion and other superstitions that teach the superiority of men as part of universal order
or bachelarette
oh dear but what can you do about it
true in many ways but one example of the contrary in french we talk about un infirmier or une infirmière the collective when both genders are involved being les infirmiers whereas in english there is that awful expression male nurse as if a nurse should be female by default
mantra
when did the word sexism first come into usage that is the starting point for this discussion everything else in this article is just complaint after the fact its interesting sociology but proves very little
the point of emasculation is that you end up a woman its insulting to women yes
lets move to newspeak and erase these troublesome words
the words prostitute and mistress should be banned immediately should rent boy and toy boy be banned too how about lech creepy dirty old man
bachelor is not the counterpart to spinster its the counterpart to maiden or if you must old maid
heh shame you didnt use all gender specific terms there  and  are both gender neutral cad yes as its origin was neutral and now only is applied to men as for poofter it has always been an unpleasant way of describing a homosexual since its inception in the early s not quite the the same thing as the article is describing as most terms for non cishet persons of all genders are perjorative sadly
women treated badly throughout history kept in their place men need words to use to help treat women badly and keep them in their place maintain male dominance try looking at the mortal doctrines of the roman catholic and later protestant church the stricture of nosexbeforemarriage applied to both genders it prevented hordes of bastards and unmarried mothers being supported by church funds words used to control both women and men were around in the past the literarture is positively swamped with morality tales of men coming to a sticky end for promiscuitybad conduct swifts rake died alone and penniless insane from syphillisdon juan was dragged bodily down to hell by the outraged spirit of the father of one of his betrayed conquestscasanova died miserably alone exiled from his beloved venice your assertion holds no water whatsoever
thanks for this courteous response im sorry not to be clear by whataboutery i primarily meant the responses saying stuff like why arent you writing about a real problem such as x several people have pointed out that there are lists of pejorative terms for men but thats not an equivalent the pattern for women is for terms referring to both sexes becoming limited to females only and then becoming solely sexual in nature andor pejorative id be very interested to hear of any terms about men that went through the same processyour proposal is very interesting but i think we see some of that here the process described in the article shows women being described in primarily sexual and often pejorative ways which fulfill some peoples gender expectations
please be more specific as to what type of sexism the grauniad is finally tackling also tackling has such rugby and fishing connotations i protest at its use in this context
this would mean a man devoid of any honour who scrounges of his wife
right so according to you absolutely everyone who grew up through the fifties and sixties when sayings like the one i ed abounded are all mentally scared for life struggling to cope in the world and generally speaking just a bit off rubbish unwind yourself from the cotton wool utopian fairies are real world you in habit and smell the crap
you forgot dippy
the english language changes from the bottom up by usage a bunch of rabid feminists or out of work actresses is not going to change that
i am a woman of course i have been on the receiving end of abuse ive dished a bit back myself perhaps i learnt to deal with it and deflect it better without recourse to whinging
yes you do at the cricket a few years ago they used to refer to women who carried the trays of beers to the men yes i am serious beer wenches
and
great article thanks
a wench is something that turns the head of a dolt
the fact that emasculation is still a word thats in use is pretty misogynistic come to think of it in that there doesnt seem to be any equivalent concept for women theres no effemulation like emasculation in one sense means to deprive a man of strength and dignity to strip him of his basic authority and power right its why some douche bags will describe stay at home dads or househusbands as emasculated men a man apparently should be outearning his wife should be in charge of his household should be leaving the chores and childcare to the women in his life if he isnt doing these things his masculinity his identity as a man is called into question theres no proper allencompassing feminine version of emasculation thats in common usage because the idea that women have any dignity or strength to be deprived of in the first place doesnt exist as in how you weaken something thats already weak how could a woman possibly lose her dignity doing chores around the house when its supposed to be her job in the first place our language paints quite a bleak picture a lot of the time
none of the examples given seem to me to be so obviously sexist as the simple observation that of the various activities that men by being on average physically bigger faster and stronger are more suited to perform than women the negative ones tend to occur collocated with words for male as agent while the positive ones dont the curse of male violence ok but what happened to the blessing of male highway maintenance or male deep sea fishing try comparing google hit counts for those
women sometimes get both genders of an animal hurled at them a woman can be equally a bitch or a dog if a man is described as a dog it is often in a phrase which is in some way admiring such as he was a salty old sea dog whereas a woman who is a dog is of loose morals andor standards of cleanliness and presentation but youre only looking at one category of words if you look at words and phrases like x is a shit wanker full of shit wankstain bag of piss old fart they tend to be applied to men exclusively i cant think off the top of my head of female equivalents
i suppose quite a few other european languages with grammatical gender and feminine forms of most occupations with male mostly treated as default are arguably worse
regardless i wont share the guilt of things done centuries before i was born no ones asking you to just accept society has been unequal for as long as there has been society and that that must stop then wonder how something so much in societys dna can be reversed as fairly and justly to all concerned and as quickly as possible and finally accept that minor inconsistencies like a waitress being allowed to call you sweetheart but you cant reciprocate is really not all that important by comparison
shakespeare had a lot of negative words about debauched men but modern english has only held onto negative terms about women what like lad culture etc
matthew probably not not sure what would maybe nothing dyed in the wool maybe just give up
if a woman ever got to rule the roost at the bank of england you can be pretty sure she would call herself manager i suspect she would simply use the current title of governor in the same way that other professions are actively winding down the use of the female versions eg actor
you are an evil patriarchal monster you
which phrase more accurately reflects the world prostitute or sex worker i know which the guardian would prefer but alas thats not the reality of the world perjorative words however hurtful or offensive reflect a users attitudes and worldview and thereby give us an insight into their character
churl will that do
the only one i can think of is doña beatriz de la cueva de alvarado th century and she would have been addressed as gubernadora spanish feminine form but this probably translates to governor in english rather than governess interestingly the wikipedia articles address this very point and it appears that governess has not changed from its original meaning wikipediaorg governorwikipediaorg governess the writer of the guardian article piggybacked on someone elses work and neither factchecked nor contemplated before putting finger to key
are you not on the patriarchy mailing list
when the freedom to offend is a freedom to harm offence is taken if i dont choose to take it how can i be harmed
if you think you are justified in violently acting against people who hold opinions that you loathe then dont be surprised when they decide to act as or more violently against you
it was once now its been extended to shut down debate 
your two sentences are completely unconnected you imply theres nothing wrong with having fun depends what your idea of fun isthough i agree that wilkinsons rhetorical question is fatuous
nonsense
it is an example of the phenomenon of stereotype threat the point which seems to be lost on you is that the perpetuation of stereotypes has consequences for the stereotyped often negative for women poc often positive for men research the topic for more examples
my gripe is that badoffensive ideas are never allowed to be properly debated and shut down academically the liberal left have been too quick to shutdown debate and stick their fingers in their ears at the first sign of offence rather than actually challenge the view headon had the left had the sense to do this there would be a lot fewer protest votes as maybe more people would feel like their justified grievances were being listened to
i delight somewhat in being described as you people i would think it true to say that the regressive left might not be voluminous but what worries the likes of maher harris and to some degree myself comes down to i think to a the influential position of certain key speakers and b the lack of criticism afforded to their output from within the broader leftwing spherecommentary in the past decade i have found that the guardian can reliably publish an editorial or opinion piece at least every onetwo months which completely encompasses a headinthesand approach to theocracy all this does is give the right wing groups press online voices more and more reason to mistrust the presentday left and imagine themselves as the only ones who have any interest in maintaining aspects of western society trump says he is the only one who can save the us for example the hypocrisy of them doing this is simply overwhelming this is the same rightwing who declares judges the enemy of the people etc however such hypocrisy on the right doesnt change the fact that left wing voices we can call them regressive are making life hard for the left wing cause unnecessarily the classic example of recent times is corbyns friends in hamas comment part of the annoyance of this is that you know that the right wing press will be able to paint corbyn and mcdonnell as terrorist sympathisers for as long as they please corbyn is merely part of a wider movement in journalism and activisim on this front id agree it may not reach out beyond those with an interest in politics but it has political traction at the moment and thats annoying its annoying in part because surely it must end leftwing theocratic apologism under the guise of political correctness is unsustainable there are simply too many contradictions involved to maintain it the conversation must at some point move towards more consistent ground and away from the mere servicing of antiwestern rage
pathetic
thats amazing i had no idea i did buy art of the deal to see what the fuss is about i know i know i got a secondhand one and the main thing i was astonished about was the lack of content the font is huge the entire book is doublelinespaced and the margins are gigantic it genuinely resembles something from the largeprint section of the library if it was printed like a normal book it would barely be pamphletsize it is the absolute definition of fluffed cant help but see this as a good metaphor for the man himself
if adolf hadnt invaded russia or bombed britain his reich might still be in business
its amazing that after  years of political experimentation we just keep coming back to plato amp his philosopher kings but this is perhaps where we are going as direct democracy a la brexit is proof enough it doesnt work the opinion of the people is important but not paramount elected representatives pander to remain popular oligarchies oppress to retain powerwealthand so what are we left with
you claim to want to open debate but make sweeping baseless antileft assertions your agenda is showing the left are critical of islam because it is a religion religions are contrary to what is a general leftist outlook which is why blair cant be a socialist and a catholic the left oppose as they have always done discrimination against people based on colour creed or sex it is a right wing lie that the left are slavishly uncritical of these groups i will argue against islam but i wont vilify individuals for their beliefs you need to stop using such a broad brush with no paint on it
if you bothered to read my comment you will see that i quite clearly talked about not inciting violence against a certain personpeople i think openly expressing the view that jews should be gassed falls under that please read comments first before ignorantly responding to them
ok how would you argue that whites dont benefit now from slavery i dont really see why one should find that concept offensive my familys polish didnt benefit from slavery then but i do think i do now because i hold a priviledged place in society in part due to slavery doesnt in anyway make me responsible for slavery
words are bricks we use for building things
just because you have a right to act stupidly define stupidly please is there a universal definition that applies to all potential actions and words
in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians perhaps if you dropped your prejudices you would be more open to defending free speech this isnt a left right issue freedom of expression benefits us all george galloway came to my university last year to give a speech and as soon as he started talking a group of about  or  people got up and attempted to assault him thankfully he was unharmed although covered in the glitter bombs they threw at him george galloway isnt a rightwing politician nor is peter tatchell or germaine greer
suggests a complementary experiment if you tell a group of girls that girls in general perform better at maths how will they perform then
i disagree debate about immigration is pretty much shut down by accusations of xenophobia or even racism towards those who want to reduce it debate about immigration has never been shut down a minority of people think any criticism of migration is racist but they have never had enough influence to shut down the debate not all antiimmigration arguments are racist or xenophobic but all racists and xenophobes are antiimmigration it is therefore inevitable that in a discussion about immigration some racists and xenophobes will air racist and xenophobic views if you feel strongly that you have not been able to freely discuss immigration because of association with racists and xenophobes you should try distancing yourself from them the words foreigner and migrant are not controversial
if people are operating under different social conditions treating everyone consistently is unjust
sometimes kizbot you are a breath of fresh air
even if they never agree with a word he says a lot of people around here could benefit massively from reading some peter hitchens agree completely hes far too conservative not to mention religious for me but seriously smart makes cogent points and unrivalled on the subject of internecine leftist sectarian squabbles
has it ever occurred to you that the reason is quite simple yes there is always a market for lazy generalisation and sloppy thinking that plays to peoples base prejudice this kind of nonsense and worse was written long before political correctness existed the point is is they can still say it and no one stops them so the idea that there is no freedom of speech is plainly complete nonsense otherwise hopkins and mackenzie would be in gaol rather than collecting fat salaries
this is a good article on where to draw the line we dont want censorship but we also dont want kids harassed into suicide by verbal assaults based assumed homosexuality or the like words absolutely can and do harm
christ your arguments are so easily countered it is pathetic have you never thought about this topic before try reading the various debates then consider how you feel about them and then come back on here and try to mount a cogent argument
it does increasingly feel like if the th century was a fitful long haul war between the far left and right the st is shaping up to be a world champion title fight between hard headed no compromise authoritarians versus currently wishy washy unless they buck their ideas up liberals
well if you cant find them here i dont know where else to look
i couldnt agree more
sounds like youve not been anywhere near a university campus for a couple of decades just because there are white males in positions of power doesnt make it right to try and silence people
there is a perception classic weaselword formulation that always turns up in these sorts of discussions since nobody has actually been prevented from saying anything by political correctness you have to talk about perceptions and since you know nobody has actually been prevented from saying anything you cant even say that you are perceiving this you have to use the passive there is why not come out of linguistic hiding what is it specifically that you personally want to say or do that political correctness is stopping you from saying doing and what specifically do you think ought to be done to lift that hindrance
as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing id love to know who you are referring to there ordinary people across the country or a cross section of the social circle of abi wilkinson
every couple of weeks another article will be published railing against campus noplatforming people like milo and other conservativeright wing commentators argue that america has a free speech problem in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls what about people who agree and are able to express their agreement in a civil manner as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing yes until recently the culture wars and ideas of pcsjws were largely conducted online although season  of south park did explore these themes and since berkeley darth milo has not been out of the news berkeley was a tipping point and brought the extremes of the pc authoritarians to mainstream news  its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of pc authoritarians that threaten the constitutionally protected right to free speech at least in the usa that use violence to quash opinions from those they accuse of being fascist i cant claim to be a neutral voice on this issue no shit campaigners against political correctness tend to insist that offence is all were arguing about from their perspective requests to stop using gay as a pejorative or avoid jokes involving racial stereotypes are about nothing more than protecting the feelings of sensitive snowflakes no we dont its funny how people arguing against the antipc folk always use ridiculous examples to support their arguments antipc means being against the woman who gets into an uber and rails against the driver for having a hawaiian hula doll on his dashboard who accuses him of being racist and insensitive and who films it thinking she can get him fired because he comes off worse or the woman who was filming at a protest over the construction of a new police station and asks a random man for his name whilst filming him then goes berserk accusing him of sexual harassment because he said his name was hugh mungus yes at first this meant noplatforming but at berkeley we saw how the antifa protestors used violence arson riots and pepper spray to shut down milos talk so when their warnings come true its clear they had a point its really funny how people writing on this subject use the worst examples
you definitely made me laugh but it shouldnt be that some people are expected to be careful in what they say whilst others arent the left have decided that certain beliefs eg white people benefit now from slavery are fine despite them being extremely questionable and definitely offensive arguments about such beliefs are curtailed by other beliefs anyone attempting to do so is shut up by whines of white priviledge and whitesplaining so the entire situation means that nobody affected by these offensive concepts is listened to about their experiences or history unsurprisingly theres a certain amount of venom this double standard generates
did the far right start the debate and the left shut it down or did the far right grow because people wanted a discussion and the centre left shut it down genuine question would be interested in others views
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed another microaggression against white men very common by the left so its little wonder that they complain
if words had only one meaning they wouldnt be words i think terry eagleton said this or he was the first person i heard saying it and we constantly argue about their multiple and often contradictory meanings all political correctness should do is bring a bit of rigour to the discussion do you mean to suggest that women are less important than men are you implying the black people less important than white that one group are innately superior to another and if so on what basis these are reasonable questions the pervasive power of advertising is a lot more powerful and insidious than a suggestion that someone might be questioning your lazily held understandings the stereotypes of gender race and class not to mention body types appearance and attraction are overwhelming and unavoidable you cant escape the billboards but they are very rarely questioned or confronted again its about who owns the platform not whos on it 
are you part of a minority group if not how can you be certain that everyday racism does not exist
lots of people agree that political correctness is a fine thing
throughout history what has been defined as common decency has changed drastically declaring a belief that gay couples should have rights or that atheists should not be subject to religious intrusions at work would have been against the common decency for much of our recent history you cant leave this for the authorities to define you simply have to accept all language no matter how offensive short of harassment and incitement to violence
less than  you say well i wouldve thought its more than that but fair play more immigration it is
 fire in a crowded theatre hitchens had a nice response to that its worth reading the whole thing here but this is the relevant bit fire fire fire fire now youve heard it not shouted in a crowded theatre admittedly as i seem now to have shouted it in the hogwarts dining hall but the point is made everyone knows the fatuous verdict of the greatly overpraised justice oliver wendell holmes who when asked for an actual example of when it would be proper to limit speech or define it as an action gave that of shouting fire in a crowded theatre its very often forgotten what he was doing in that case was sending to prison a group of yiddish speaking socialists whose literature was printed in a language most americans couldnt read opposing mr wilsons participation in the first world war and the dragging of the united states into that sanguinary conflict which the yiddish speaking socialists had fled from russia to escape in fact it could be just as plausibly argued that the yiddish speaking socialists who were jailed by the excellent and greatly overpraised judge oliver wendell holmes were the real fire fighters were the ones shouting fire when there really was a fire in a very crowded theatre indeed and who is to decide well keep that question if you would
or go on a riot and stop you speaking at a university dont try to portray the opponents of discourse as the heroes
to e a guardian opinion piece from a few days ago a joke is never just a joke you see it always has consequences jokes help identify and solidify social divisions arwa mahdawi
strange i could have sworn there were numerous satirists on both uk and us tv shows i guess thats just an alternative fact
sadly thats not enough for some people i challenge anyone to read this article and not find it absurd httpmashablecomtransgenderallywordssnacmanpsqr
indeed bad manners
when the g originally reported it it was not as an opinion piece but as news
that doesnt wash how are teachers today meant to teach kids in school when the words used today will be found offensive tomorrow by some unaccountable arbiter of taste have you never been caught out really never
the author makes it pretty clear that as long as highprofile journos arent impacted by it then its totally fine and other people who have their careers destroyed as a direct result are irrelevant im sure that the authors profession has no bearing on this conclusion however as the author is white and classprivileged im sure she will agree that shes not allowed to have a valid opinion on the matter
no the left just wants people to be accountable for their comments if you make a racistsexisthomophobic comment in the name of free speech expect people to criticise said comment in the name of free speech
yes and that is all so called political correctness is nothing more than being civil
that should be feels like its been there forever
before putting any restrictions or control structures in place in areas such as freedom of speech first ask yourself  are there bigger and nastier bastards out there than me would i be happy with those bigger and nastier bastards hijacking the control structures i put in place and using them for their own purposes if the answer to both is yes than be very careful the best form of government would be a benevolent altruistic dictator however the answer to the questions above show why it is also the worst form of government
in this country people are free to say whatever they likethen why do overseas people try to go libel shopping in the uk its because they know courts will help punish and silence their adversaries if they manage to sue here
i dont understand why critising white europeans can be construed as racistit never used to be like that
yes and those people and theyre racists
but what if those opinions actually are racisthomophobicsexist heres the problem if you label people who actually are not those things what label will you give to people who actually are those things its the law of diminishing returns
i think these sorts of conventions are largely driven by leftwing student politicians every new generation of these people finds fault with the preexisting terminology perhaps because of the strange effect whereby anything that was there before you feels like its been there before you and feels the need to invent a new one
hmmm i cant give you a definite answer to that at the moment
assuming youre talking about the mail i believe that should be banned because its so factually inaccurate and written with such a clear agenda and distorted one sided narrative that its a clear case of false advertising not because i find their views offensive by all means be right wing if you want just dont write fiction and sell it as fact as for trawling the internet for comments its the right wing us government who are forcing people to show their social media history to officials at the borders and its a right wing uk government implementing the snoopers charter and is currently working on the digital economy bill those on the left are against all of the above
or as jimmy carr put it offense is taken not given what offends one person might not offend another which means the idea that something is offensive is entirely subjective and a matter of individual interpretation
there is a deliberate attempt from the far right to stoke hatred of muslims as a group the strategy of the left has been to jump uncritically to the defence of muslims and to silence any discussion of some real issues pertaining to the muslim population of the uk this is extremely shortsighted on the part of the left because it leads them down a blind alley of hypocrisy naivety and willful obtuseness im trying to find others who are interested in opening a new discourse that bases its approach to the issues on a rational liberal and humane platform
but as long as kelvin mackenzie and katie hopkins are still getting published in hugely popular national newspapers has it ever occurred to you that the reason is quite simple many many people have had it up to the eyeballs with the politically correct identity politics pseudo intellectual claptrap that is dished out on a daily basis in articles like this and other progressive media many many people would be glad to see the back of the progressive values crowdor at least to have a break from them becauase they really are an irritating pain in the backside defeat over the past year has made them even worse
tell me have you ever been on the receiving end of casual racist or sexist abuse
the only problem with that is that these days moms basement probably has excellent internet access so cowering in a basement wont prevent someone being offended maybe moms cave on mount ararat
where shall i start try gollywog as previously used on jars of robertsons jam
youre not wrong at all i have since found that it was satire though so everyone wins i suppose
this is completely unworkable you might say white people have far more opportunities than others and i might be offended by it you cant limit free speech like this if you disagree with an idea disprove and debate it short of violence and harassment people should be free to say whatever nonsense they like and we should be free to ridicule them for it
ignore childhood memories of sticks and stones wtf if youre having to hack lessons learned in childhood from our heads then youve gone very wrong somewhere im afraid
if youre asking me personally then my answer is no to all of those questions thank you these pages are filled with the more extreme views and in real life i rarely never actually hear people talking so hatefully to one another as they feel inclined to do here thank heavens or there would be a civil war if people here were representative of the general population guardian articles and comment pieces are deliberatly constructed as no doubt can be said of other papers to be devisive and therefore to bring out the worst in people good for clicks sadly
well to judge from many of the btl comments banal as this may be a lot of people dont agree moderate and balanced viewpointsas i think this isoften get drowned out by the shouts from extremists from either side
commentators rail against the largely imaginary threat of censorship because its easier than acknowledging that the world doesnt revolve around them censorship is real and a constant it is insidious and we should all be alert to it constantly this account was recently subject to such censorship for several months for accurately describing a wellknown and litigious mep as a liar for submitting demonstrably inaccurate expense claims
will you have a problem when trevor phillips defends free speech and denigrates pc on tv tonight
ive just looked it up and im afraid i must admit with some embarassment that the original source appears to be super deluxe a facebook page which is indeed satirical sanity is preserved for one more day it seems i submit in its place fat people destroying scales not the same thing i know but arguably the same vein of thought httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpynzowsdtu
that is political correctness thats wholly circular political correctness is by definition and use a label applied to standards of civility that you disagree with but believe to be mandated or imposed by some nebulous intelligentsia by presenting two unambiguous and largely uncontroversial extremes you make it falsely seem like a binary distinction whereas in truth the language dismissed and mocked by some as pc is merely basic civility to most users i find myself infuriated by having civil discourse dismissed as political correctness in much the same way as i would feel discombobulated by some thug shoving their way to the front of a queue full of old people it seems to be a defiant and unthinking rejection of basic civility id note that theres another aspect the shibboleth some words phrases etc are either espoused or shunned not because of their impact on others but because of their ability to signal the espousal or rejection of a set of values using lgbtiq for example is not being politically correct so much as it is a declaration of ethos and loyalty obviously the use of shibboleths runs through all communication in and across all groups
who decides what is racistsexisthomophobic views
i never believed in satire anyway its lazy intellectualism at best to take down a notch those you dont agree with without having to come up with a viable alternative to take their place
paul mason wears a leather jacket a leather jacket
theres even more layers of irony in that trump didnt write them has only passing awareness of whats in them and his ghostwriter is now one of his most vociferous critics

the spectator is far superior to the guardian is that even in doubt
hitchens even if they never agree with a word he says a lot of people around here could benefit massively from reading some peter hitchens
one cannot offend one can only be offended discuss
freedom to offend over gender and raceskin color issues no freedom to offend over political or religious affiliation absolutely yes any day any hour of the day
when mostly white males insist on equality for all its safe in the knowledge that that means they will always been on top im not trying to be picky here but i cant tell what tense that sentence is meant to be written in and its quite important on a general point it is almost inevitably the case that sooner or later the people who suffer most from less freedom are the poorest and weakest however it seems that he and his supporters want to tell others what religion they can practice how they can express themselves what a woman can do with her body where a person can travel what employees a business can hire what the media can report how the judiciary may interpret the law what a persons gender should be i would not vote for trump but most of these claims are either unsupported by the facts or not about freedom of speech for example i have not read anywhere that trump is trying to ban the practice of any particular religion if you have some facts to the contrary then please post them also whatever position one takes on the issue something like abortion rights is not a matter of free speech banning the expression of support for abortion rights or conversely the expression of opposition would indeed be a matter of free speech to be honest your post is big on incoherent indignation but low on reasoned argument still i support your right to say it
it is an interesting point although i think the le penlebanon incident has a definite whiff or orchestration about it it is hard to beat the immigrants should respect national identity roles drum when in france and then simultaneously visit a foreign country and not adhere to their expectations even if there are wildly conflicting political sensitivities in play
sounds about right
the socalled antifa movement in america were pictured burning a pile of trump books the other day trump didnt mind each burned book represented a sale hed probably be the first guy to sale you as many books as you wanted to buy in order to burn them trump doesnt care he just hears the sound of that cash register ringing
funny when i first moved to england  years ago i found out it was highly incorrect to call a black person a black person nobody could tell me why i was left to conclude that being black wasnt very nice the correct term we were solemnly told was coloured people ludicrous who decided these conventions the same self appointed thought police on the left that exist today
it seemed a rather light inclusion yes and didnt improve the article more interesting is the research that shows girls associate genius and high levels of intelligence with boys and men theres some history to be studied there
excluding violence i dont mind people protesting against trump in the streets but i have an issue when such protests fail to take it on themselves to selfpolice and keep opportunistic violent troublemakers out of their ranks having the right to free speech and protest is very different from exploiting it to commit violent acts
translation the left gets stuck up about words they tell people off for using the wrong words and insist that they should use the right words this annoys people its not the lefties fault they shouldnt give up their word policing instead they should teach people to understand why they use some words and not others we dont need to abandon our language because it isnt instantly recognisable to most people we just need to explain it
its not that people outside the political left are too stupid to understand words like intersectionality its that the words we use are signifiers of who we are as people which tribes we belong to and in using movementspecific jargon the left runs the risk of sending a message that it is not like the very people it is supposed to be fighting for i think that this would have been a good place to stop as it maybe just maybe hints at a glimmer of understanding that the difficulties that the left finds itself in and the reasons why nobody is listening any more are at least partly selfinflicted unfortunately the article continues and deeper down the rabbit hole we go
is she right that progressive activists insistence on certain language stifles conversation what language is this if it does stifle conversation which it it almost certainly does then it certainly destroys thought because we think in words if so it is the opposite of progressive it is paleolithically reactionary and would account for the unopposed disinterrment of prehistoric thoughtprocesses todays left simply has no imagination at its disposal since imagination knows no barriers and might lead to heresy it poses as progressive but is in reality a swarm of closetreactionaries the pacifist disease being a case in point
can i please ask at what point did  or whatever the number is of humanity have a meeting and agree to be referred to as cis or did you on the left presume it on our behalf one tuesday afternoon when it had nothing better to do this ridiculous word has only come into use as a default opposite to the word trans i will take great pleasure in rejecting any branch of politics that considers this unnecessary and unwanted epithet in anyway acceptable presumably i would fall under the assumed terms of this but i completely reject this kind of labeling idiocy so dont do it i refrain from s words to describe peoples sexuality or gender so id ask you to stop calling me names too now go away and come up with some actual policies for running the country in everybodys interest trans or not trans
you can no more control how people refer to things outside of the largely sensible policing of criminallydefined hate speech than i can get every to start saying flububashub when they think something they are eating is quite tasty
because if we are aware that a particular historical figure was responsible for the unnecessary deaths of millions of people we may avoid ing him for fear that we may be seen as an admirer if someone ed pol pot
who was shooting themselves in the foot benedict cumberbatch my heart went out to him somewhat he was trying to make a point about inclusivity in filmmaking a good point but he got mixed up between people of colour and coloured people its precisely this kind of crowing nitpicking which will have people who can speak up for important issues backing away rapidly from subjects for fear of not using the exact correct phrase as deemed correct by some nebulous body
no one is being talked down to
so adichie basically said the said thing that germaine greer said previously which led to her being noplatformed and hounded by progressives for being wrong everyone doesnt have to think the same although thats clearly the way things are going on the left
a couple of years ago my colleague holly and i wrote a piece for the new statesman suggesting that words such as intersectionality alienated women like us aka women from low income backgrounds the very people feminism should be trying to recruit they make feminism seem overly distant and academic and intimidating the abuse and threats we received convinced me that there is little point in having a debate with these people i feel very little affinity with the internet left i think it is the humourlessness that gets me more than anything
a lot of people on the left have slipped in to a very controlling and judgemental phase where heresy is potentially behind every act and using words can be a sin and even one sin no matter how small is enough to have you cast in to damnation religious words and imagery used because i see it as no different to a faith become fanatical and righteous in the s the stereotypical figure was michael douglass character in wall st today it will be some youngster on the left screaming at people about their thought crimes
this is reactionary thinking with knobs on er with buttons on
to say that the modern left faces challenging times is a gross understatement yes mostly because  of the real world care about their jobs schools communities country they really couldnt give a flying fuck about identity politics pc language and the rest of the bs which consumes too many on the left when they see them championing some minority cause all it does is reinforce the notion that labourleft care more about those causes than the day job of standing up for the majority
the term left itself is rapidly becoming meaningless as no one has redefined it for the st century ill redefine it for you wankers
i quite like this piece for what its worth however it fails to account for the ways in which words are actually used not just what they ideally mean in my experience intersectionality is often used as a trump card to criticise the arguments and opinions of people but surely that is just another form of an ad hominem in that it doesnt actually confront the argument only the person making it if backed with enough evidence insight and thoughtfulness any argument can be persuasive no matter who makes it or their background
the hard right have language orthodoxy in spades just think of all the racial slurs and abusive terms around gender or sexual preference
ghetto comes from th century italian and referred to jews yet some people will use it in preference to housing estate or projects
perhaps immature in the sense that such language policing is most heavily promoted by a selfreferencing minority who are or used to be ostentatiously active on certain student committees they have their intellectual mentors of course and the relationship them between is not disimilar to napoleon and his secret dogs in animal farm
agree and shouldnt her flawed opinion be examined for any merits whatsoever rather than being shouted down immediatelyi would rather see ideas tested to destruction and debate occurring even if people awkwardly trespass onto nonpc terminologyfor example i find the discussion about gender and bathrooms to be one where i support transgender rights i am very much less certain about the lines of being accepting as transgender women competing in oh goodness im already tying myself up here trying to think of how to put this without being transphobic womens athletics etc these are subjects which need to be discussed not suppressed but by making the language achingly impossible to use apart from those in the sociology departments at liberal arts universities these important issues cant be debatedi dont see why adichie has been attacked for airing what is a subject which needs airing i speak as a leftieish feminist who is really concerned about the suppression and intimidation of people through language
the left mustnt get hung up over language orthodoxy we must be welcoming have a chat with the guardian editor and see if she wants to close down the pc and identity politics focused columns i think you may be wasting your time
lots of words but no argument
what effing consensus
thats not all she said she said that trans women grow up with male privilege thats quite a different assertion and is easily contested we just have to look at the high rates of violence murder and bullying against trans women to see that there is no privilege
i know via and trans from my days as a chemistry student and find it odd for the terms to be used in gender politics
i dont understand the need for cis either it seems pointless you have women and you have transwomen why do you need a word for people who were born women
another way of putting it might be that people in general like believing theyre victims because it alleviates them of responsibility and so dont want to engage with any argument that suggests that there are ways in which society benefits them and then indeed along comes trump youre all victims and its the liberals fault if you dont feel successful just like pickup artists tell lonely men its feminisms fault that women dont want you and so on and so on
i think probably only a minority of the left are particularly concerned with transgender issues compared to a majority more concerned with poverty in general the wider concern is that the left as a whole are not currently doing that particularly well right now
why
what the fck are you talking about
does the left have a problem with language orthodoxy very definitely language orthodoxy intellectual orthodoxy that is a reactionary tendency not a progressive one so anyone promoting it is not of the socalled left it is an ideological contradiction however the process of identifying the political content of language and imagery is an honourable tradition and more essential now that ever and also more inevitable given the increase in both written and visual literacy of the last  years the inevitable backlash to this new awareness is just the deathbed hate of another elitist era
im a white hetero male from the middle upoer class and i love it
i was reading an article in ebony the other day chastising a white girl trying to sound ghetto i was surprised because she sounded nothing like a th century italian jewunless of course the word ghetto has been culturally appropriated
mmmm keep it up sound that death knell baby
its a term used in chemsitry to describe types of bonds i vaguley recall cis and trans bonds
priceless
i didnt say it was
its quite simple cis is an aadjective that describes people who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth so a cis manso a cis man is a man who was assigned a birth gender of male a cis woman is a woman who was assigned female gender at birthsee not difficult
its only open to interpretation because many on the left are antisemitic so they need to reframe its definition
could you explain why adichies reasoning is flawed
please dont use the word cis its an offensive term imposed by the selfidentifying trans community no one identifies with cis specific issues
we e words because they are apt and true but we tend to avoid doing so with particular individuals who brought about the unnecessary deaths of millions of people assuming we are aware of this fact
the left cant be effective anymore so they have become pedantic and oppressive no doubt big jim callaghan would have had to step down these days if the same self serving faux left tiwiterati had been around these days
the idea that trans women are not the same as women who are born that way is perfectly acceptable indeed correct its all in the way you phrase it if by saying this youre implying that trans women dont have it as tough as real women then youre talking horseshit the problem with greer and moore is that their positions comes from wanting to ringfence cis women and feminism in general against supposed infiltration from people they deem to be men its a morally bankrupt failure to recognise that in many important ways the experiences of trans women and cis women do overlap
given that cis means on this side of and trans means on the other side of i think the terms cisgender and transgender should be banned outright the other side of what exactly why are people being made to feel as though theyve moved to the other side of something when as per this article and the angry response to chimamanda ngozi adichies article people who identify as men or women were that gender all along regardless of the body they were born in im really not sure why these offensive terms have been allowed to take root id have thought the guardian would be all over this sort of thing
the thing is often these beliefs arent progressive on closer examination they are regressive
its an opinion based on flawed reasoning thats not the same as a flawed opinion which is a fairly meaningless term
if the left spent half the time they spend worrying about transgender issues which have implications for a tiny fraction of the population worrying about issues that are of concern to most working people then they might be in government and be occupied with making peoples lives better rather than obsessing over who can use which toilet what percentage of the voters that the left need to win over to their side care about or have even ever heard of intersectionality
what fun how ive longed to hear challenges over language orthodoxy fought on the doorsteps during elections low paid workers everywhere will rejoice who says the labour party has no future 
if i say the world is round and then commit mass murder does that mean the world immediately ceases to be round i dont think so we e words because they are apt and true not as a personal tribute to the person who uttered them
for the left to be relevant its intellectual leaders need to focus on issues that the voters care about and speak in a language that the voters understand whether trans women are more or less victimized than cis women is no such issue and intersectionality is incomprehensible to  of us
annoying predictable and pointless
ok some thoughts based on the way its reported here adichies put out her opinion and other people criticised her for it where does language orthodoxy come in it sounds like they disagreed with the meat of her argument secondly regarding orwells fourth rule never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday english equivalent what everyday english equivalent is there for the two terms cited cis and intersectionality obviously transphobic people dont want to use the word cis because they insist cis just means normal but thats the big clue isnt it sometimes people resist these words not because theyre jargonistic but because of the ideas they represent people hate the word cis because to use it implies that trans people are just as normal as you that theres no default overall this article suffers from employing the same broad generalisations that are used by intolerant and smallminded people yes of course some people go too far when it comes to policing political conversation that doesnt mean the entirety of the left is unwelcoming if anything the left is so welcoming that it now accounts for a huge range of different opinions and positions that strongly disagree with each other if you want to talk about orthodoxy look at parochial british conservatism with its boorish whining contempt for everyone and everything from hippies to feminists muslims to modern art computer games poetry socialism etc etc etc etc
is it the case that activists insistence on certain language stifles conversation do we alienate potential converts by insisting they use befuddling academic terms and some in spades thank god you do you might add try to run out of town those who dont agree with you
agreed it is immature it is also entirely unproductive unfortunately it is much easier to argue semantics and slightly mud at each other than actually be mature and figure out how to work together to actually bring about change this focus on semantics is one of the reasons the left is flailing and failing globally juvenile undergrads undoing the good work that came before them instead of building on it
so despite over  words of pseudscorner waffle it turns out that adichies opinion is still flawed why cant she just have that opinion rather than being forced to change it theres a rank hypocrisy in there that undermines the entire articles premise the term left itself is rapidly becoming meaningless as no one has redefined it for the st century id consider myself leftwing but the utter obsession with identity politics is causing a form of paralysis on the left where big controversial or hardedged ideas wont ever develop for either fear of causing offence or being perceived as not left enough terms like woke are so grating and patronising that theres no wonder that the broader public are utterly tuned out of what the left is saying for most it just seems like middleclass virtue signalling or a form of branding both of which seem to lack a genuine authenticity i may not  agree with adichies views but at least theres some real honesty there the left is now so atomised it seems more obsessed with bickering over microaggressions rather than taking the fight to the populists they refuse to couch anything in terms that the broader public can get behind and seem utterly myopic and selfobsessed corbyns labour is a great example of a party that doesnt know what it wants to say or how to say it and thats meant to be the rallying point for the left in this country instead were writing blogs about nothing much of anything whilst the right dismantles the country
absolutely part of the problem with the left is the victim culture of so many of the self obsessed factions convinced that their inequalities are worse than everyone elses and its all the fault of other privileged people usually the evil white heterosexual men thats not to say inequalities dont exist but it detracts focus from the issues that matter to a lot of working class folk
has anyone got a dictionary
in my opinion global warming is a chinese hoax looks pretty flawed to me on account of being false illinformed selfserving and harmful if its not just as good as any other opinion on global warming it must be flawed in some way
disappointed whats the difference between being disappointed in someones opinions and disagreeing with them if none why not say you disagree and why i think i know what orwell would say
its not about language ignoring the probability perhaps proven fact that there is a male brain and a female brain and that they are sometimes mixed up is an idea it is an idea based on the unscientific notion that all differences are caused by gender bias and it leaves feminism in the uncomfortable position of being antliberationist and conservative
how do yo figure that
can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion without being given the chance to change that opinion im afraid this is where you lost me perhaps it would be better if you saidif we cannot convince people with the strength and elegance of our arguments then maybe our ideas simply arent being communicated well i find that language does not respond well to diktats
above all we have to believe that the left can take people on a political journey yes but who would volunteer for such a journey if it meant attending mind reconditioning camps first we now have now reached a ludicrous state of affairs were even left wing luminaries are being shouted down by pc zealots with bullhorns
the modern left would usually do best by remaining totally silent rather than bastardising the language with their own bizarre usages and preaching haughtily to others who fail to conform to them this approach might be useful for purposes of points scoring within a clique but it puts normal people right off and makes the left appear odd eccentric intolerant and cranky
the more general lesson to be learned is that simply because youve moved on to the next level of progressive enlightenment that doesnt mean everyone else is going to immediately fall into line with you because the world doesnt revolve around you it might take some people longer to get with the programme than you and indeed some people may die before they get there the moral zeitgeist is not a constant it shifts at different speeds in different places and for different people the fact somebody is at a different stage of progressive enlightenment to you does not make them a bad person and does not mean its your duty or even your right to try and change their mind for them indeed in most cases attempting to change their mind will only serve to harden their hearts against your cause this seems to crop up time and time again in relation to transgender people and im not sure its really doing anybody any good
do you mean the manner in which cumberbatch was criticised for using the word coloured by the national association for the advancement of coloured people beyond satire
i dont think there was any further proof needed after the shadow chancellor having consulted his speechwriters and spin doctors apparently felt it was a good idea to approvingly e chairman mao in the house of commons
movement specific jargon language orthodoxy what strange world is this
im a leftleaning man and ill freely admit i dont have a clue what cis means i didnt agree with much of what adichie said however it seemed like the usual my victimhood is worse than your victimhood factionalism that has indeed rendered the left quite useless from this white straight mans perspective women suffer prejudice black people suffer prejudice and trans people suffer prejudice that seems like a pretty good foundation for a movement to unite people to fight together for justice its a pity the left is too busy not getting over itself to get over itself
im not on the left but even i can see they would be better off going back to the language of marx class conflict economic oppression the need for radical change against an entrenched elite firebrands like lenin made a lot of headway with this kind of rhetoric instead we get poststructuralist musings on identity and victimhood
oh goody more obscurist conditioning
the obsession of so many leftwingers with being morepoliticallycorrectthanthou is entirely counterproductive obviously a xenophobic facist tory annoying isnt it
agreed that was a prime example of shooting oneself in the foot before putting it into mouth
and if even adichie who has done more to popularise feminism than  of women in the public eye can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion theres no such thing as a flawed opinion thats a category error
yeah but not that left that left that left is just another word for tory not like that left that left is based on principles
following the backlash adichie  why should there be a backlash the idea that people who havent grown up as women cant know what it means to do so and wont understand fully the effects of it seems pretty contentious to me
i never thought id say this but i agree with emo the obsession of so many leftwingers with being morepoliticallycorrectthanthou is entirely counterproductive
 name a kind of gender privilege which is barely recognised in mainstream culture as even existing the problem with telling them they have gender privilege is that privilege is something that can be taken awayand people who are struggling to find and keep work or survive with the work they have dont see them selves as that privileged at all so on the one hand who have rich campus lefties telling poor white women and men they are benefiting from this privilegeyou have poor white women and men struggling to make ends meet along come trump
the problem is that those flawed opinions do tend to be ones that you and i am mean you personally disagree with consensus is ignored unless we are discussing what constitutes antisemitism then everything is open for interpretation
she is essentially repeating what germaine greer said albeit within the marxist framework of identity politics greers argument was more about biology the sisterhood dont like it when you step out of line
for the answer we can turn to lenin the fact that you feel you can e lenin with abandon whose food confiscation programmes killed  million russians tells us all we need to know about the irrelevance of the left in fact not just the mere irrelevance but contempt and hostility that you e such an odious historical figure seemingly oblivious to the facts suggests as if further proof were needed that left wing intellectual traditions amount to nothing but indoctrination
this all day speaking as a leftwinger this insistence on precise academic terminology which is constantly shifting when discussing almost any issue seems to me to just be an exercise in excluding people from debate who dont have batchelors degrees from an expensive liberal university that is very very bad news indeed for the health of left politics furthermore its incredibly immature
spot on the arrogance of even suggesting an opinion is incorrect without even feeling the need to attempt to demonstrate it is a rather worrying development nowadays
my group is more victimized that your group so im right and youre wrong and if you keep talking ill brand you as a bigot
i never knew cis was an academic term intersectionality however is a brilliant word and must be used more often
theres a teensy weensy slightly fking ginormous problem out there and the left is sitting here arguing semantics i would tear my hair out if i had any left
the very idea of privilege is nonsense and divisive yet the complaining author still uses it the idea that not having bad things happen to you makes you privileged is a stretch of the word which makes people whove done nothing wrong into the problem it has shifted the focus away from racists sexists homophobes and the like to people who havent suffered from these transgressions by way of attributes they themselves have no control over i have no sympathy for people who fall foul of the same ridiculous ideologies they support
the left
if anyone described me as a cis male off think they were a prick
its not that people outside the political left are too stupid to understand words like intersectionality no but being of campus theyre too busy trying to pay the rent to give a f so they vote for people who address their concerns not talk down to them
during an interview with channel  adichie said i think if youve lived in the world as a man with the privileges that the world accords to men and then sort of change gender its difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning as a woman and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are she was accused of failing to listen to the experiences of trans women i can see good points on both sides the problem is surely in thinking that only one can be correct and that we have to determine a winner trans women have not grown up with the disadvantages that women have and in that regard their experience is certainly different from that of many women but it is somewhat facile to say that they have grown up with the privileges of men if those privileges were bought at the cost of an enormous amount of denying or hiding their sexual identity then maybe they didnt feel very much like privileges it would help to listen to trans women to understand their experience in any case isnt this just a special if extreme case of a broader point that the experiences of different women or people are different there are women who have grown up with the privileges of class or race or wealth and women who havent and their experiences arent exactly comparable either so why single out trans womens experiences as unrepresentative
is she right that progressive activists insistence on certain language stifles conversation yes  do we alienate potential converts by insisting they use befuddling academic terms yes  or is language too important to compromise on do you want four more years followed by president pence
the problem with they is that it leads to inconsistencies between singular and plural forms of verbs although that can sometimes be fixed by restructuring the sentence i try to use ms but it always seems to get converted to miss when i write it on a registration form very annoying
history has no connection with the masculine possessive pronoun originates from latin historia so a bit daft to say this frankly
what aspects of our language assume people are white unless i suppose you mean we might say black manwomanfarmerpolitician whereas we rarely say white manwomanfarmerpolitician but thats a reflection of cultural reality rather than embedded sexism in the language because black people are the minority in this particular society and certain professions no doubt if you go to a majority nonwhite country then this phenomenon is reversed women arent they are the majority and therefore the norm in society if not in certain professions the generic male pronoun isnt a reflection of a reality but of a philosophy
batcow  october  am  i thought it was generally used for the last one in a list of at least two things
because to refer to someone as a female mp in any context other than one in which their gender is relevant eg in an article about how many women mps there are is to imply that being female is in some way weird or aberrant there have been many studies showing that this kind of thing genuinely makes a difference to peoples thinking a good example was one where volunteers were asked to put together a scrapbook about the lives of people around the world they were given various magazines and other resources to cut pictures out of one group were asked to fill it with pictures on subjects like social man family man man at war etc others were given subjects like social life families warfare etc those given the gendered subjects despite the fact that they were well aware the word man was being used in a generic sense used far more male images in their scrapbooks than the others using genderspecific words primes the brain to male images and this subtly excludes women from discourse
sue me only if you are minted
youre point is idiotic and you will make yourself look foolish you may wish to look at the first word in that sentence before you accuse others of foolishness especially as this is the mind your language blog
angler or deck hand if theyre on a commercial vessel fisherman is still the usual term for both genders
its a politician joke you know the kind of witticism that gets a laugh when put into a conference speech but which isnt actually at all funny even in a technical linguistic sense it does provide the party faithful with a tiny jolt of forced levity
it is a language game using she declares your political faith extra marks for putting sic after he when ing a historic figure who plainly would have said he depending on your peer group using she makes you an iconaclast or a conformist in academia using he doubtless niggles the right on
its often overlooked but i like to use they when im teaching english to nonnatives pictures where you can just see hands for example do the trick then of course you need are impersonal you versus one and personal you is another good one and only today i wanted to use countryman and had to change my sentence to try and be more politically correct its got to the point that i dont even feel comfortable saying history
why do we need to differentiate between the genderssexes anyway it is almost never relevant apart from to discriminate against women obviously
first time ive ever mentioned it wasnt really a gripe just a lighthearted observation
jesus said hed make his disciples fishers of men if thats any help
mancuniensis  october  am  should we be urging them to change why would we care how other people speak their own language we care about our own
im often an inanimate object so have no problem with being called it 
joseph  october  am get ciffix for chrome get women on company boars i have a mental image of a woman in a smart suit riding a boar with a company logo printed on its side it is awesome
ive always thought it should be simply e or e he she abbreviated into a single letterit only sounds funny because we dont use it that way but makes perfect sense i think e thinks
fishfighters
my donkeysve been using it for a long time too amp they bray its fine
i dont think the writer comes across as particularly offended more interested in how our language adapts or not to social change
mancuniensis  october  am  its not top down ive been using they and their for the generic nearly my whole life lots of people use it its not even new i use it because it sounds a lot less awkward than he or she rubbish and i refuse point blank to use generic hesue me
i think its an implicit assumption rather than overt racist language youd rarely hear a character decribed as short old and white just short and old but if the character is black this is normally overtly described the assumption is often that characters are white unless described otherwise i dont know but i guess the opposite would be true in other cultures literature where its assumed people are of the majority ethnicity unless described otherwise
what does it say about the french that they seem happy with madame and mademoiselle the italians with signora and signorina etc should we regard them as more sexist than us should we be urging them to change yes and yes and incidentally there are plenty of campaigners in france and italy who have been doing just that for decades
slightest bit of offence i dont call regarding women as a subgroup of men slightly offensive thats pretty damn offensive
one exception however is when the context makes it clear what the gender is for example if a male football team a has just lost to a much worse team b it would be silly to be so scared of sounding sexist that one writes each member of team a should look at themselves in the mirror and think what they can do to improve
a a milne was a fan of the latter you mean he was a fan of the last one you can only use the word latter if there are  things
heesh a bit pissed and sheesh had a few as well
libor london interbank offered rate
first youve heard of it
thingie is quite useful i find as in chairthingie
what does it say about the french that they seem happy with madame and mademoiselle the italians with signora and signorina etc there is a general trend throughout europe to use madame signora frau etc to describe all adult women
i just wonder what it says about us that we feel the need to change our language in this way that we are trying to get our language to reflect the reality of the world around us perhaps that is what language is there to do after all
goodoldcause  october  am  its simply cringingly juvenile like other phrases such libor condem nation etc
whilst pregnant and not knowing the sex of our baby i didnt like referring to it so generally used they instead ie they were awake all night and i was very surprised at the number of people who picked up on this and said they are you having twins i hadnt realised that so many people still purely associated they with the plural
well you grammar is clearly poor then there is absolutely no need to use they or their you could even resort to he or she which is infinitely better
tehillim  october  am  good grief do you spend your time looking for ways to be insulted on the internet
the consistent use of a single sex pronoun when no sex has been defined is what sounds weird and clumsy im afraid and why so many people reject it
thanks for that i have been a translator for  years in that time you may be amazed to hear i have indeed come to realise that language changes but there is a difference between natural ground up change and change forced upon us top down by persons in authority and pressure groups
his essay denouncing the passive voice i missed that one
thank you for some sense i hate it when i read letters and article which refer to an employee as they or their nothing wrong with repeating employee or saying his or her
most sexist and racist language arises from the presumption that everyone is male and white if you can just remember that this is not in fact the case its easy to avoid anyone can do it if they try this stuck out as strange no mention of racist language until the concluding paragraph i guess its because this is just an edited extract of a book and it would make more sense in that context also im struggling to see a comparison i cant think of any daytoday phrases where race is implicit in the same way as the examples for sex but perhaps im just missing them
that is easy go down to grimsby docks and take a poll of the women coming in from working on the trawlers make sure you get a representative sample
if the change had already been fully implemented we wouldnt even be discussing it the issue may have existed for a long time but not the change what does it say about the french that they seem happy with madame and mademoiselle the italians with signora and signorina etc should we regard them as more sexist than us should we be urging them to change
mancuniensis  october  am  language changes all the time we are always changing the way we use words because of changing mores because of other trends because things just do changeget over it
an endless source of amusement to the kind of person who thinks it witty to call her harriet harperson thats a send up of ms harmans own dogmatic gender politics as you surely must know
given that harman loves all women shortlists and would like positive discrimination to get women on company boars why is it to drivel to suppose shed contemplate demanding at least one woman on the archbishop shortlist perfectly plausible what would be wildly implausible is that shed ever question why there are more career women than career men that gap can get as wide as it likes and shed put it down to women getting what they deserve
kirstenbroomhall  october  am  the things people occupy their minds with
i refuse to use words like spokeswoman chairperson because they assume that the man part of the word actually contains lexical information when really it is just a sound pronounced mun anyway not man it also implies that there is some great difference between a spokesman and spokeswoman which there is not the difference in the supposed gender of a speaker has little to do with the function that they are performing as a spokesman i also refuse to use actress for redundancy reasons there is absolutely no difference in the function of a male actor and female actor why the gender of the person must be included in their job description i have no idea
politically correct nonsense
hammers  october  am  doesnt sound unnatural to me
quit griping will yousheesh
if they can do it so can you i can do and do do it but thanks for your condescending permission
i totally disagree although one has to admit one hadnt seen those strange examples from carroll and shakespeare im joking with the the use of one and blame their editors for those slipups they for a singular is clumsy illogical ungrammatical and rings out as one of the most egregious examples of the illfamed political correctness gone mad when we know were only talking about men use the word he only women she if were talking generally why not stick to the plural they the other issue is fuzzy thinking combined with the nature of english whether the concept being dealt with is singular or plural is the question that needs answering incidentally i love using she to refer to a singular example of a person doing something as long as its consistent in a piece of text why notand if we dont know the gender like here he or she rolls off the tongue quite nicely dont you think adds richness to the language he or she must be joking
henrik weithefelt  october  am  youre point is idiotic and you will make yourself look foolish carrying on but ho hum the internet is for everyone
noyouareomanju  october  am  have been using it for donkeys years sounds totally natural to me
i quite like it when someone refers to harriet harperson it immediately tells me that nothing they have to say is worth listening to
elmerfudd  october  am  some of his pronouncements are a fun read but all are safely ignored
one of the best british authors of the last century is george orwell read  if you want to know what kind of people love to regulate language congratulations henrik weithefelt youve just won the weekly cif hyperbole wrapped in stupidity wrapped in wtf award what are you going to do next
ive been using they and their for donkeys years as i absolutely hate the crappy generic hei think chair is the best and least awkward choice and spokesperson as neither sex nor gender may always be obvious
it isnt a change its existed for a long time
sheesh
i would distinguish the terms sexist and gendernormative when used as adjectives to the word language generic pronouns are an example of the latter brought about as often as not by restrictions of the language itself there are many ways to use generic gendered pronouns in a nonsexist manner for example by alternating between the two agree that the simplest way is just to go with the they family though the conservative party of course has had two female chairmen in recent years which is up to them many organisations favour chair although chairwoman sounds fine to me as does spokeswoman as an equivalent to spokesman my french housemate asked me recently about the preferred word for chairman i advised him that generally just using chair is fine and that generally genderneutral terms should be used whenever possible but thats in part because chair is a natural shortened form it would feel strange referring to a spokes rather than a spokesman or spokeswoman within not much more than a couple of decades policemen and woman police constables have become police officers firemen are now firefighters male nurses are nurses postmen are postal workers air hostesses have become cabin crew in all these cases language reflects the fact that jobs once largely the preserve of one sex are now increasingly filled by either career girls is outdated as well as offensive when career women outnumber career men opponents of such modest but significant changes respond with feeble jokes about nonexistent proposals to person the barricades and the like its not so long ago that female doctors were rare enough to be given the description lady doctor sexist habits persist in using woman as an adjective in such phrases as woman bishop and women mps with their pejorative echo of women drivers you dont hear anyone described as a man mp but then thats what most mps always have been yup this is where we stray into genuinely sexist language i think female doctor as a term is still more common than you might think though the old riddle with the doctor saying i cannot operate on this man he is my son still causes a good deal of hesitation among most people before they actually get it
unfortunately orwell himself wanted to regulate language but he didnt know enough about it to coherently articulate what he wanted or he knew and was just blustering for example his essay denouncing the passive voice as a means for obscuring agency a uses the passive voice at an aboveaverage rate and b ignores all the other ways one can omit the agent from a sentence and the fact that of course passive constructions do allow you to include an agent just not as the grammatical subject
does this really matter does anyone actually get upset other than the person who wrote this article if they here terms like female mp or male nurse or whatever its just an accurate way to describe someone and shouldnt cause any offence to anyone
 weithefelt errr no just no
i just wonder what it says about us that we feel the need to change our language in this way is there a nation on earth more obsessed than ours about the faintest possibility of causing the slightest bit of offence to anybody at all except to bankers trolls and daily mail readers obviously however unintentional
the heshe debate also exists in sweden the plural de is only very uncommonly used in the case where gender is unknown and so most choose han he over hon she instead some have now imported the gender neutral finnish word hen to differentiate so now i can refer to women as hen just like back home in scotland
we do have a singular neutral version of he and she it is called it however using that to refer to a person would be considered offensive because it would suggest that they are an inanimate object
i have yet to find a good term for a female fisherman or a term for a mixedgender group of people who fish for the former the obvious one is fisherwoman for the latter fishers but they dont seem to go down well when i suggest them to colleagues it would be good to know what terms are used within the industry 
i wonder if well ever have a female pm
digs at the daily mail are now appearing in articles about grammar where will it end
doubleplusungood
career women outnumber career men outrageous what is the government going to do about this gender imbalance in the workplace oh
i never understand the objection to singular they it does the job perfectly and adds to the richness of the language i cant stand the use of he as gender neutral because clearly its not in american writing ive seen she used as a generic pronoun which solves nothing whatsoever and feels very artificial singular they all the way
most sexist and racist language arises from the presumption that everyone is male and white if you can just remember that this is not in fact the case its easy to avoid anyone can do it if they try one of the best british authors of the last century is george orwell read  if you want to know what kind of people love to regulate language
my wifes ungrammatic but i love she
while appreciating your view id beg to differ it all forms part of the same process of eliminating feminine endings which i cant abide either
i know it will be a shock but there are female fire fighters wow
or the grauniad by the look of things
this makes no sense sie funny because it is sexism the other way around as its the female pronoun in singular is hat while plural is habenso the conjugation of have changes the meaning rather than the pronoun youd have to say they has brushed their teeth if youd like to compare it to german in fact they third person singular would be an excellent way to solve sexism and resolve the issue with misunderstanding the sentencesaying they are and they have in singular might solve sexism but not misunderstandings
what really annoys me is when a writer will try to push her agenda on readers of books that are unrelated like thati often read in books on it development phrases such as if the developer wants this to happen she should do thisi totally agree that there should be more female developers but this kind of pointmaking just annihilates the flow of the sentence and destroys any concentration on what could be a difficult topic not only that no female nondeveloper will be convinced by this to join the profession as they wont even be reading the bloody book in the first place
try writing she everyone uses they in speech how can that be excused as your accent
yet many journalists use they when they are writing about exclusively female issues such as fgm pregnancy and breastfeeding surely she is the only personal pronoun that should be used when referring to a woman and in a similar vein he should be used when the subject is obviously maleto write sentences such as a man fell of his bike and hurt their arm or a woman was told to leave the shop for breastfeeding their baby is plain stupid as well as wrong
themselves
ok has anyone got an opinion on the use of themself
erisnt they plural
its sad to discover the language that became the lingua franca of the greatest empire the world has ever known and articulated many of the worlds most important cultural philosophical and scientific concepts is really just a vehicle for chauvinistic piggery great piece of investigative journalism
well it seems that a lot of people from certain parts of the world think that the generic term to follow dear is sir ive never worked out whether this is due to inherent sexism and theyre assuming that anyone who works in my field must be male or down to bizarre english teaching whereby they are taught that this is generic
used like that its fine but something like jim is coming for your birthday they arrive at pm sounds wrong and i think this is what the author is encouraging
they is used to refer to groups of  people or when the referent is of unknown gender learn the history of how people speak english
i once lived in a part of the world where there was no distinction grammatically between male and female pronouns and other definers were arranged by noun class not gender however traditionally there was what i can only describe as vicious misogyny within the tribal customs i still ponder that one
good attempt but youre trying too hard
perhaps you could guess and risk being corrected no the point of someone choosing a nongendered noun eg partner requires you out of politeness not to be nosy presumptuous or an arse they could have easily had said boyfriendgirlfriendhusbandwife at which point youd use a singular appropriately it sounds terrible to me aesthetics aint grammur
you is used in the singular and plural without causing any undue confusion normally a pronoun is not used without there first being some mention of what it refers to if youre talking to someone who out of the blue declares they cleaned their teeth this morning without providing any context then there may be a bigger issue to address than whether they is being used as singular or plural
oopsi meant to respond to the comment below yours the impact is a little lost now
loose
politicised teachers are a nightmare i hope your students werent too embarrassed when they were corrected by people who speak normally
yeah that bloody chaucer
still learnt normal english though obviously thats the problem todays normal english
its a problem only in the states this may be because there have historically been so many nonnative speakers that grammar has taken on a much more central role than in european english
if somewhat begrudgingly before i would begrudge people a favour id eschew it altogether you misjudge my tone perhaps i dont think that the man at the door example sounds that awkward awkwardness apparently lies in the ears of the beholder i do however believe that minimising the use of they as a singular pronoun might help avoid the problem that has arisen from the elimination of the thou form otoh should there be a critical mass of english speakers who would do so aye theres the rub id enthusiastically take up using spivak pronouns i dont understand your judge problem maybe im being slow could you give an example my point is that the gender presumptions inherent  a judge should always ensure he is disinterested in any case he hears are only masked by the substitution  a judge should always ensure they are disinterested any case they hear and thats quite apart from mere personal aesthetics ie  a judge they sounding clumsy to my ears in a way that  someone they does not the problem as i see it is that when we speak of a judge we picture him and do so without much mental effort or otoh by a concerted effort we might do the opposite and picture her it is astoundingly difficult to picture a genderless judge i submit that they use of they in that situation does nothing to address this but merely masks it we should be picturing a collection of judges whose diversity reflects our experience that they are male female black white i would prefer judges should always ensure they are disinterested in the cases they hear in any case ive found it a good discipline to maintain to speak in the singular when speaking of embodied gendered ampc individuals and in the plural when speaking of classes of individuals ill concede the unknown individual someone as an exception almost a necessary one
i was told the same about she using their name was considered correct
if you dont know the gender use shit
why apologize instead of simply thinking more clearly about these things grammar is my profession no doubt and just what do you suppose to have been the professions of my th grade through th grade english teachers those teachers instructed me in english as it was professionally taught from  through  their own professional training and college education was some ten to twenty years prior to those years in many cases since those days ive taken a university degree myself so i have a better understanding of what my teachers had gone through before they ever stood before us in the classroom ive also seen firsthand no small number of college students and graduates since my own collge days post  and i can tell you that just as todays average college students dont compare very well to my peers in the quality of their education and knowledge they cut an even poorer figure when compared to my early teachers college and postgraduate training and knowledge in their professon if your points in this exchange have demonstrated anything its that my teachers then had at least as much right and authority to tell us what constituted good versus poor english usage as you claim now claim for yourselfas a grammar professional if youre a prescriptivist in grammar how do you dare dismiss their professional competence to have done then what you presume to do today if youre not a grammar prescriptivist then i must assume you pretend to no authority to tell me or anyone else what constitutes better or worse english grammar which of the two is the case and why and how is it that youre more correct today than any of them were then you dont bother to explain these things
to exaggerate its use in order to totally eliminate gender from the language noone is suggesting that though its to avoid specifying what is unknown and that function has been part of the language since adam spakethed it
she doesnt only refer to human females but to all females ships and some countries in many languages she refers to roughly onethird to onehalf of all inanimate objects merely having a vagina entitles you to only a small subset of the world occupied by she so getting rid of she altogether as a way of dealing with human sexism doesnt seem fair to the word
they is used to refer to groups of  people learn how to speak english how about changing the words positive and negative to aladeen as in i am hiv aladeen
hmm the connection sounds a bit tenuous especially as finnish is completely unrelated to any other scandinavian language its only distant relative in europe is magyar and im not sure that hungary is quite so notable for gender equality
yes but confusing too to simply use he in a situation where the gender isnt specified the feminist was arguing with the chauvinist because he was daftor im sure we could construct a better one with some thought now this is ambiguous but i expect we read that a certain way because we have some preconceptions about the gender of the protagonists
personally i think we should make a fuss over any use of language that excludes us by gender just in english or also in languages such as german where every word for an occupation has a feminine equivalent or all the other languages which have gendered nouns and no singular pronoun that covers both genders and are therefore by your logic inherently sexist its only because english has so few examples of gender distinctions that the idea of abolishing them is at all feasible
youre means you are singular so only the person to whom you spoke would be invited in order to invite more that one it would be you are all invited heshe and mrmrsms are redundant we dont actually need them i do not use mrsmiss or ms my relationship status is irrelevant in terms of addressing me and he and she is based on an assumption related to appearance
im happy to use they but wont give up on firemen
i think shona a bantu language spoken in zimbabwe is gender neutral the same pronoun is used to denote male and female a however emphasis is placed on relational hierarchy and hierarchy is not necessarily gender defined
i didnt know that anyway thats just one family but it was drummed into us cheers
yes but the verb changes too sie kann she can and sie können they can
youre being willingly obtuse
is that some sort of kebab thing
well i suppose shes more likely to know were you ever told a reason or was it before your time
sperm doner otherwise known as special sauce
sorry i wanted to add they and their has the potential to be very confusing as it already exists as a third person plural commentators have listed examples already so they may work in some situations the doctor spoke to us they reassured us that everything was okay it might be mightily confusing in others the doctor and the three men exchanged words they were reassured after that brief discussion
i can see the sense behind this where i am sceptical is in the forced nature of introducing something as a rule as others have mentioned already they is already in use not widely but still in use while in written language she does the trick and yes its binary but to be honest i really fail to see the exclusionary value here i mark coursework and to preserve anonymity i always write she hisher that way both the feminine and masculine pronoun are mentioned first each once i wouldnt dream of using he exclusively
the auther is stupid they dont understand that using he or she isnt offensive to somebody who is a he or a she and biologically we all are one of or the other except about  of the population who then usually decide to be one or the other surely if your trans you are going from one to the other as well so you will be able to define when you have left one gender and joined the other it seems like feminists are creating a problem that really doesnt exist as if they hasnt been used for hundreds of years already
i started using they to avoid being sexist having been pointedly advised to do so by harriet harman when she was at nccl in  and it has been fairly commonplace over all those years it can jar at times though alternating the use of he and she throughout a piece of writing can alleviate thatnot only does this article have nothing new to add to a  yearold usage its authors concern for the use of english is not matched by her or her subs attention to other aspects of grammar or style
there is no such thing as a mans profession except sperm doner
after my facetious mark i think i should explain that the plural they doesnt mean a change in the language it has a long history as stated in the article its most usually used when the gender of the person is not determined or when talking about the hypothetical or the general
typical feminist cant understand a joke instead they take offence like it was aimed at them
nice idea but a bit of a mouthful it also has a lot of heshe baggage how about se as a new singular genderneutral pronoun at what angle should se point the plane in thirty years time it would also be applicable for referring to the ai that flies the plane
try it in a romantic description and it sounds it sounds like nobody would ever say that since i presume most people know the gender of the object of their affections
calm down singular they does not make you gay
no point send my best to lynne
yes because a conversation that goesspeaker  somebody called for you earlier onspeaker  what did they wantis a complete orwellian nightmare
i think youre in a huge minority finding the word mankind hugely offensive to women its no more than a quirk of our ancient language with its roots in very different times there is of course humankind which has been around for a very long time for use by those who have nothing more pressing to care about
there are usually plenty of visual indicators except in the north and scotland where in some places its simply impossible to determine whats what and probably better not to ask
i was once told as a kid that all hurricanes were female because women were so destructive  are you sure
of course it all sounds wrong to you but it shouldnt particularly because its in common useful useage i went to a crap posh school that taught me what they thought i needed to know and also had a father whose knowledge of grammer likewise was so taught and corrected me on stuff that everyone used still learnt normal english though
kaseterkorn you are making up nonsense sentences that no native speaker would ever say in an attempt to provewhatsingular they has its usesthose uses dont include referring to the third person when the gender is known or obvious
so youre happy to use they when gender is unknown and happy if somewhat begrudgingly to use they when its somebodys personal choice so far so good i dont think that the man at the door example sounds that awkward though i think it does imply annoyancedistancing ive even heard it used like this your husbands on the phone oh god what do they want now not to imply that this is common but i think it happens and i think its serving some specific purpose its an interesting one i dont understand your judge problem maybe im being slow could you give an example
and i check my spelling more thoroughly than i did for the above post
i write for governmnet publications at times and i have been using they for ages i think its a very acceptable pronoun to use when needed although i have often comlpetely rewritten sentences to avoid the need for a pronoun at all its isnt pc which i think is a furphy one persons pc is another persons deeply held distaste for belittling language its just a gener neutral word that means what you are saying isnt excluding  of the population the whole sexismfeminism thing is interesting i have some theories on this but they are for another place a crude summary would be women are awesome and men cant handle it
do we really need this
as the storm raged the tea cup rocked and they all drowned
im confused about the actual point though i thought everyone used they for nongender specific pronouns its been a rule for ages i thought
i spotted this problem while reading reports at a promotion board i know only ranks and surnames and performance not colour age weight beauty and yet i still completely unnecessarily know their sex by the gender of pronoun and it influences the board subconsciously and unfairly and for those who say that shouldnt matter for a woman in a mans profession  at last estimate it does make a difference
on da street down south we use yous very occasionally to mean a plural you usually you all or yawl
if my mother calls ask them what they want
there is they i was taught to use they as a nongendered pronoun more than  years ago from when i was starting to write i rarely see he or she used in place of they unless im not noticing it
so we can keep that then i thought most people already used they for a nonspecified gender i was taught it in school more than  years ago
could of is atrocious and well worth freaking out about its an illiterate mishearing of couldve which would never occur if the user considered the verb to have for one second you wouldnt be happy if i said i of just replied to your comment would you
staple ill whurze that to then
firstly many people already use the singular they when gender is unknown someone stole my cake theyre in big trouble fair enough where someone is used because it is an individual whose gender was unknown i would probably use they as well my problem is more with uses such the user is king  a judge should  where we really are not speaking of individuals but classes of individuals using they will function there only to mask inherent sexism for when one imagines a user or a judge one imagines an embodied individual really we ought to be imagining various diverse users and judges there the plural recommends itself theres a man at the door really what do they want that sounds awkward i think that would be he he is after all a man once again theres someone at the door  secondly we have more people now who dont identify as he or she i already addressed that if people require specific forms of address not to be hurt it doesnt cost us too much to comply
we used to call the female conductor of our choir the conductress but that was as a joke when conductresses referred to bus conductresses if they still had them they would probably be called customer service consultants that would solve the problem too
if you avoid using pronouns the text becomes repetitive he or she is clumsy they is a useful device where it was traditional for the person to be male or female but nowadays is as likely to be one as the other there seem to be slightly more female tram drivers than males and there are not a few female train drivers
your friend is pregnant your spouse or both cant tell you that youd know if theyre male or female
if a driver wants to go to town dem needs to turn left at the lights innit fam
wtf if someone told you they had just brushed their teeth they would say to you  i have brushed my teeth  why is that confusing 
firstly many people already use the singular they when gender is unknown someone stole my cake theyre in big trouble talking to a gender less individual might be rare but talking about a gender less individual is an everyday occurrence we even use it harmlessly enough when gender is known theres a man at the door really what do they want secondly we have more people now who dont identify as he or she and using they is nice and easy to use referring to them i do think thats a good reason to use they i dont think this is introducing anything new its just formally accepting something which already occurs widely
isnt this another case of someone proposing a solution that uses something thats been around for a seriously long time to a problem thats never been there
then they come back again as in you and yall because singulars and plurals are useful concepts if you say youre invited to the party do you really want everyone in earshot to turn up
if the femalemale teacher identifies the male andor female culprits shehe sends the male andor female culprits to the female or male head teacher cracked it
excellent piece i can remember moving to bristol and remember being asked so wheres they from i looked round but they were talking to me love the bristol accent they were from staple hill thats where they lived to
oh for goodness sake nobody would ever say that a silly made up example doesnt prove anything
shouldnt you say men and women women and men doesnt sound right
english is wonderfully flexible in that respect and practically genderless especially compared to other languages perhaps when compared to spanish but not when compared to finnish or icelandic which use genderneutral pronouns such as hän interestingly finland and iceland are also ranked as the worlds most genderequal societies sweden which has borrowed hän from finnish is not far behind
totally agree genderless they is not particularly new in britain may be more so in the us though entertaining to read the comments of people who panic as soon as they stumble upon anything they describe as pc gone mad and use that lazy label to say i want to keep doing things the way i always did go away
my friend is going to visit my spouse in hospital theyre pregnant yes very informative
except that the plurals in spanish are male if they refer to a group of men and women ie one amigo and ten amigas would be eleven amigos other languages have similar rules
while women do get named after their sexual organs a lot a lot examples woman isnt related to womb girl originally meant children of both genders and of uncertain origin before that lass is uncertain origin but not seemingly sexual either lady is uncertain the most common proposal being a breadkneader mistress is the feminisation of master again nonsexual harlot originates in homeless both genders wench doesnt have a sexual origination either that i can find or do you mean there are a number of archaic words theyd be fun to know ps strumpet looks like it might have originated in the sexual act of straddling
i think that a lot of the commentators here have misunderstood something the writer wishes there was a singular pronoun that could be used in place of he or she when the gender of the person being referred to is not known she is not asking for all singular pronouns to be replaced that wouldnt make sense although most people it seems dont buy this idea that language is at all weighted towards man it is worth pointing out the use of the generic he and other words like mankind were obviously put in place and used with that bias otherwise why arent we having this discussion about she furthermore the obvious effect of using he for an unknown person is the automatic thought that it must be a man of course in everyday speech this isnt much of a problem because we use they and dont think twice about it but it is a grammatical error in the written mode just like we say theres lots of us for example when we would write there are lots of us
how do you know mary is or identifies as a woman
for years ive done this and i thought it was common its also something ive always defended against more gender inclined languages such as spanish where both singular and plural are both split between male and female for example we use it whereas in spanish its either masculine or feminine its with pride when i say im seeing a friend they arrive at pm giving absolutely no hint whatsoever as to whether its a male friend or a female friend you cant escape it in spanish you have to say amigo or amiga english is wonderfully flexible in that respect and practically genderless especially compared to other languages
ah yes the liberal pc feministic guradian the same feministic guardian that barely reported on the mass sexual assaults throughout europe and instead defends extremely sexist religions in the name of pcness
this doesnt seem new to me they has been used to denote someone whose sex is not pertinent for as long as i can remember as in if someone calls ask them what they want or i have a friend who always spends more money than they have
serious question i know that is true for german and french it is true for other languages what about noneuropean languages
funny thing is i used to pay attention to this topic the worsening shrillness and entitlement of the selfabsorbed feminists who drool here has actually helped me abandon this nonsense i use formal he where required they when plural and have totally given up the she and presumptive she crap
yes because being a woman is considered equal and they arent using it in a demeaning way whatsoever of course they arent 
the point about words like this is not to ban them but also not to deny that they are a gendermarked termed and just like using he to refer to everyone or man and mankind in the same way using guys to refer to women may put them second or effaces them altogether the usual test for whether such a word is truly gender neutral is to adopt it in phrases like there were loads of new guys at the mother and toddler group today and see whether it still sounds gender neutral i would say not whether you want to continue using it or not is then up to you
yeah thats how its used universally i would have thought david morrison may need to concentrate on something a bit more serious as an issue as australian of the year
a bunch of arse tintenfische does not paint a pretty mental picture
not folks please ive had it for years at work and its horribly patronising
australian of the year david morrison who chairs the council said guys is used thoughtlessly i have removed it from my lexicon many workplace emails start with the phrase hi guys but it is masculine there might be people who go thats what i say all the time and i dont mean it to be in any way disrespectful but its not what you intend its how youre listened to selfparodic levels of simpering teethgrindingly sanctimonious sjwism from the most undeserving aoty winner in history seriously picking that guy sorry cisgender identifying male was the equivalent of fifa giving the world cup to qatar

what a waste of time it is an accepted form of address what do you want ladies and gentlemen grow up and move on
httpmyoutubecomwatchvmxoffjaufe
im a woman i used guys in a gender neutral way no ones ever given me the stinkeye because of it
what we should be asking for is more consideration more thoughtfulness in our daily lexiconagree completely from both sides a bit more tolerance from feminists may demonstrate that words dont really matter that much in the main and that we should all just rub alongon the other hand insulting behaviour is unacceptable in any form its just that i dont think using the generic guys is insulting and as avril henry quite rightly states there are much bigger battles to be won
in the theatre its common to address people of either sex as darling i suggest the universal adoption of this term as it has nonsexual connotations come on darlings
citizen or comrade would both be acceptable forms of address 
by guys i assume you mean men
what is it supposed to mean is this article solely about australia i am lost
and yet now the pc term for actress is actor where is the logic in thatthe origin of a word like guy is not important if it were wed have to find a nonsexist term for woman since it comes from wifman surely the term guys has become gender neutral for any normal person living in the st century
but then i did what all white men should do regularly i checked my privilege if you are being sarcastic then i will give you an lol if you are being serious you can piss right off
this is a pisstake is suspect
parody
it has a different shade for a military feller though a lot of internal defence stuff really does sort of assume the readers are males in that context its not too bad that youd want to consciously try to avoid it for the rest of us though nah guys is fine
check your privilege a phrase used so often on the guardian that it has lost all meaning
identity politics is a bunch of arse
nowadays theres a growing trend among guys to jokingly address a group of mates as ladies as in gday ladies what are you drinking or well ladies id better get home before the missus chucks a shitty all good clean non pc blokeish fun
correct white male oppressor scum a simple equation of identity politics mate
i agree with you in general and certainly in terms of your anecdote but it is possible to cause hurt without actually intending to do so framing it as hurt or harm rather than offence is important i think if you have a genuine desire not to do it
i may be wrong but my understanding of freedom in its original enlightenment setting is that there is the assumption that debate will be carried out in a rational manner leaving some flexibility for rhetorical devices this surely precludes abuse and giving offence the whole rationale behind opposition to political correctness is that people want the right to be offensive and abusive and as racisthomophobicsexist as people used to be political correctness is not about freedom but showing respect to fellow human beings regardless of how we feel about them in order to exist society needs political correctness
theres been a study showing women cant multitask either
debate certainly appears to be becoming more and more polarised perhaps because of this tendency we have to create confirmation bias feedback loops within our digital social enclaves the truth is rarely found at the extremes but somewhere in the middle it is possible indeed highly likely both that political correctness has become oppressive and ridiculous and is being weaponised in some quarters and that having no restrictions on harmful speech is bad for society less of allornothing thinking would be welcome
if only  of all the rape and racial abuse that is apparently going on on college campuses was in fact happening they should be shut down all the administration sacked or up in front of a judge and a whole new admin and student base installed nearly all the lurid tales of campus life turn out to be baseless lies or so tenuous you wonder what is the thinking that is driving it if this college rape epidemic is for real then close them down
most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by most of the things written heresophisticated and refined mind of some columnists and of themes are far from the people
we absolutely agree on that young people of the left especially in the us have been infested by radical nondemocratic ideas without even realizing they believe that they are fighting for justice or democracy but in essence they become enablers of totalitarianism
in trust we god
i dont have any pride in the sense that you mean it and therefore no hurt ill ask you a third time because im genuinely intrrigued what makes some people think they are more superior to most could you please tell us what specifically made you come to the conclusion that you more intelligent and that your opinion is more worthy than many of those here on cif and most of the people in the uk my thought is that you have little man syndrome but maybe you really are better than most of us
as with all liberals speech is free so long as they approve of it
i may not agree with your comments about greece but that was a pleasure to read well said
frightened conservatives are at heart spineless authoritarians shocked by the disobedience of nonconformity those who do not obey the rulers are an enemy dangerously provoking the displeasure of said rulersvery odd thing to say frank when its the left who have an obsession with what everyone says amp does pc was born out of the desire to control conformity all must say do amp believe the same thing
isnt political correctness based on a false premise that language limits thought being leftwing i hate to say it but another left liberal nonsense though left liberals are neither left nor liberal but old fashioned puritans you can limit what is said you cant limit thought and by extension meaning people are subversive they will not be told what to think even if what they say is policed other words will take on the meaning of the words that are banned it isnt so much what you say to someone that matters but the nuance the cadence the look in the eye the body language students who protest to ban ideas should get some backbone in fact i question their being students in the first place with such an attitude
when the freedom to offend is a freedom to harm then its time to grow a skin
surely the key problem at the moment is that the lines are being blurred between hate speech and opinions we dont like a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps this is quite an interesting point although presumably the stereotype exists because woman are on average worse at reading maps so what is to be done about that should it be illegal or socially unacceptable to make jokes about women and map reading would that also then extend to making jokes about men not being able to multitask
seems to me that you can attempt to make people play nice with each other but that fundamentally there are quite a lot of rather unpleasant folk walking the planet who have absolutely no issue with dealing with their own hangups by trying to make others feel as miserable as themselves
thats amazing funny and biting a genuine thankyou for putting me on to him i had never heard the name before
unlike the genuinely worrying authoritarianism of theresa mays government which is backed up with political power censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger who laid the foundations of mays authoritarianism that would be the new labour government that the guardian is so nostalgic about the one that was very keen to introduce compulsory identity cards and wanted the power to lock anyone up indefinitely without charge the one under which the security services ran amok and antiterrorism powers were invoked to expel critics from the party conference authoritarianism is created by people like you who say its ok when we do it and then are shocked when the pendulum swings and your opponents get hold of the same levers
i would say sometime rather than usually sometimes its not simply placards sometimes fire alarms are pulled and sometimes they sit in the audience and disrupt the speaker or seek to intimidate them as well one example would be here where they go so far as to turn off the laptopprojector its not a simple matter of being peaceful protesters
then what are you arguing about you either agreedisagree or compromise with me on the issues my argument is with the piece above which seeks to defend political correctness as a means of policing debate personally i think you have a problem because we are still a democracy and you seem to have decided that majority opinion as seen with trump and brexit is somehow unacceptable
no you do not deny it a platform where possible it must be heard in order to provide counter arguments try to shut it down and you only succeed in driving it underground to the dark web or to the outer fringes of the political spectrum
the problem is that people on both sides but usually right wing snowflakes or the populist correctness police seem to think that free speech means you can say whatever you want and that you should be completely free from criticism or accountability for your comments so when they say something that reasonable people find offensive they cant cope with the backlash and resort to the fascist lefties attacking my right to free speech line which simply isnt true other people are perfectly entitled to use their right to free speech to tell you they disagree however colourfully they choose to do so
i personally dont think it made any sense there are so many meaty substantive things regarding brexit and johnson which one can and should stand up about and speak out about but instead grandstanding and philosophizing about his use of one word taking into account everything involved with brexit thats what someone should stand up about its splitting hairs when theres no actual hair there absurd completely divorced from reality pc nonsense
good comment
you mean the useful idiots
this article is full to the brim of microaggressions wtf amp racial sexist class stereotypes accusing white men of never having suffered oppression in history being both factually inaccurate amp an horrendous generalisationbut i do not take offense being an adult means putting up with the poorly informed amp bigoted without running to the teacher every time they say our write something asinine
ive specifically referred to who i think is being unsurprisingly silent i mean with the liberal side theyve long been against him and much of the commentary ive seen has been along those lines rather thanthis time hes gone too far
the balance of power is important even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impact student activists dont have the ability to stop highprofile journalists writing what they damn well please however much they might wish it were otherwise theres a debate to be had about how we think about and define free speech but as long as kelvin mackenzie and katie hopkins are still getting published in hugely popular national newspapers its largely academic so should we only worry about freedom of speech once it has been lost i suggest we attack vehemently all those who try to limit freedom of speech whether from the left or right at every opportunity we should do so even if those who are being prevented from speaking in one place are able to speak elsewhere we should not give one inch to the censors
it is not possible to give offence only to take it everyone is offensive to someone by targeting the offender you are targeting everyone and soon you become the target the old fashioned sticks and stones rhyme had purpose and good reason we need to learn to cope with others differing views opinions and dislikes if we value our own freedom to express our own views and thus allow some others to choose to be offended then we also have to allow others to express themselves freely and learn to cope with their views as we demand that they cope with ours the law quite rightly separately deals with threats and physical violence as they are very different in trying to combine them as reason not to have to hear views different to your own this paper and the liberal establishment have created the need for the likes of trump a mirror reflection of their own intolerance fortunately to date the vast majority of those who supported trump have not displayed the levels of hatred they have had to endure from the liberal elite who have never listened if they dont listen soon their hatred too will most likely will be returned to them
youre proving my point yourself on this thread by bringing nothing except chippy hurt pride to the table
its basically the a racistfascistidiot is anyone who disagrees with you defence do you think that we live in a fascist state do you think every issue in the me east is the wests fault do you think that our treatment of refugees is the exact equivalent of how the nazis treated jews do you think cameron and may and every other tory are pigs do you think that trump is the exact moral equivalent of hitler do you think that anyone with a degree is automatically more intelligent than everyone without a degree because thats what a lot of you think on these pages and thats why in the real world few take you seriously
the current campaign to denigrate political correctness is merely the right going through a phase of deep insecurity conservatives get frightened by change half of america is in a permanent state of deep conservatism and every now and then lashes out at those who take the world forward unfortunately the uk is not much different with its sneering rightwing commentators with their stock phrases for denigrating progressives
i certainly think it is a subject that should currently be discussed within society as the lines between what is and isnt acceptable seem quite blurred nowadays hate speech is already illegal in the uk  a person is guilty of an offence if with intent to cause a person harassment alarm or distress he a uses threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour or b displays any writing sign or other visible representation which is threatening abusive or insulting thereby causing that or another person harassment alarm or distress i think free speech is very important unfortunately there are people who consider hate speech to be free speech
incorrect im afraid the correct bit is below mr hitler if you think old englands done
just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should theres nothing wrong with acting stupidly often stupid people have more fun
whatever happened to i disagree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
but the writer here i imagine to see themselves as a progressive liberal lefty not an authoritarian oh dont they always theres always a reason why what theyre doing is just different easiest way is to claim dissenting opinions cause actual psychological harm invalidate my experience then justify being authoritarian on the basis of protecting people in fact thats always been the justification for authoritarianism i would argue that were we even to take most of these people at their word and accept their distress is real harm that we do not pander to the lowest common denominator the weakest minds in society the most damaged people around and get them some psychological help if thats really what they think
it is quite hilarious how so many left wing feminists seems to think that muslim women wearing headscarves is somehow a victory for womens rights indeed le pen shows the way for modern feminists when asked to don a headscarf when meeting with officials from lebanon she refused in the ensuing stalemate she then promptly left compare and contrast this with swedens feminist government covering themselves up in the presence of iranian officials
one compelling reason why the social justice left should rethink their policy of censoriousness is that they are achieving little except empowering those they consider their enemies thousands more people than could have possibly fitted into a lecture theatre in cardiff now know what germaine greers views on transsexuals are millions who would never have heard of milo yianopolis have many of whom will now consider him a freespeech martyr
every now and then i rewatch a video by hitchens on free speech one e sticks out the most its not just the right of person who speaks to be heard it is the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hearand every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action because you deny yourself the right to hear something i suggest everyone watch it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjyoofrogem
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed it seems to me that the group that are making themselves heard at the moment through the likes of trump are white straight males who are not classprivileged precisely because the classprivilege bit has been ignored
as for the evidence what evidence most of these theories come from social science departments and they are so much evidence based as a few activists around a table deciding what they will claim next that suits their cause when was the last time that you saw eg biology medical or other related experts in the recent discussions about gender even more importantly would they be allowed to speak freely or would they be intimidated with things like bigot you do not understand modern society etc which get the conversation trapped in a circular argument see what happened with flynn and his ideas on iq as long as it suited the progressive ideological agenta he was a hero but check the article here about a year ago he is not a hero anymore apparently
grow thicker skins all this pc bs that you can only say things that wont offend anyone people have different opinions and they should be allowed to be heard however offensive however racist antisemitic prowar
true its much easier to control peoplesociety in this state keeping them dependent easy to manipulate fixated on identity rather than their potential as individuals welcome to the glories of cultural marxism
theres the problem why its literally how things function right now people are empowered to make certain decisions whether thats who to invite and disinvite onto a stage or what laws to vote in of what policy to set in an institution those decisions inevitably reflect the wider debate that goes on around them what alternative system do you think improves on this are there inconsistencies and hypocrisies yes as your point about maher demonstrates but in general with a few exceptions people who condone paedophilia are shunned and excluded and this is reflected in the decisions of figures in authority everywhere not to invite them on stages or publish their books
but i dont think the issue is pretty simple at all just a lot of the arguments from peoplebots who are too lazy crude to think about it in depth
yep absolutely right and those horrible folks at charlie hebdo they deserved everythingoops
everything is dependent on context the problem lies in the fact that the golden rule is inherently selfcentred and following it can lead to harm to the other i have never taken issue with people jokingly insulting me or my russian origins however rude because it simply doesnt compute as an issue for me so i could argue that the same should be the case when i insult others in jest this is obviously not accurate for all people and there is a better rule for actions towards other people the platinum rule do not do unto others as you thinkfeelbelieve they would not wish to be done unto themselves following this rule you cant cause harm but it is information imperfect unlike the golden rule which only relies on selfknowledge which we can assume is well developed for people meaning that for any given individual there will be a length of time when not enough experience is available to make an accurate judgement as to whether you will fulfill the rule and not cause offence though of course some aspects of individuals can be extrapolated through knowledge of their cultural identity stereotyping isnt inherently unjust if there is not information about the individual you are talking to with the aim of saying something that could be taken as offensive fall back on the golden as the lowest limit of behaviour if you dont know any better its fair that you treat others as you would wish to be treated or you could always ask them approximately where their line is
im not against political correctness but  should make it clear whether we like it not that pc culture has been an increasingly tough sell since the economic crash somewhat unwittingly pc culture has communicated the idea that leftwing and liberal politics is only concerned with the suffering of historically oppressed groups and minorities and withholds sympathy for those who are not part of such groups this doesnt hold up well when most bar the  are suffering in some way and feel political rage regardless of whether or not gender class or ethnicity has previously established different starting points for this suffering i think this is a balanced article but in general the output of the guardian can add to the resentment against pc culture often for its tone as much as its content the hierarchy of concern for a stereotypical guardian reader as reflected in its pages is one of generalisations and moral certainties which often dont fit with the lived reality say of immigration which is surely neither bad nor good but entirely contingent on circumstance such as regional economic context there are aspects of pc culture with which we could do with being honest with ourselves when it comes down to it in the last decade or so at the heart of political correctness in the west has been a huge contradiction this is that the left and particularly the farleft have actually been tolerant of all manner of intolerance misogyny racism and so on so long as it finds occasion within nonwestern groups themselves aligned against western groups the farleft finds common cause with plenty of offensive language and belief so long as it is made in the overarching service of antiwestern sentiment this can be put down as an understandable reaction to blair and iraq but ultimately it is not a helpful one the majority of people in britain are suffering financially but arent antiwestern culture and so political correctness on a symbolic level at least has precisely nothing to offer them in the present moment this will continue so long as pc remains too often a mouthpiece for farleft antiwestern anything but christianity sentiment rather than as a strictly secular instrument of civil respect engagement equality trust and so on i would add finally that in my opinion all of this ought not be such a big deal in any case if the liberalelitemedia types want to shut down your free speech its not clear how they could achieve this and who ultimately cares about the other sides fingerwagging well the answer to that question right now is everyone everyone seems to care an awful lot about everyone elses moral behaviour and moral approval or lack of personally i think this is because at present both right and left have basically run out of real political ideas in the absence of having any real political plan for the future or anything better to do we are living in an age of turgid moralism the correct response to this is not outrage but boredom
do you mean like everyone who voted brexit is a racist
yes this argument in particular was ridiculous
theres also that chap they wheeled out as an ordinary working class northerner who opposed brexit the effect was rather ruined when he went on to write more articles about his independent film projects in kurdistan
yes unfortunately i do you dont get to pick which bits you like its all or nothing as long as they arent breaking the law
street scenes lol im using fight in a metaphoric sense as well as literal here this isnt s germany no matter how hard edl types wish it were so antifa protesters can be as boneheaded as the dover rally skinheads i think we are a ways off from street clashes just now but hey who knows for instance whilst proeu liberals sat back on the referendum ukip and leave campaigners were pounding the streets mopping up disaffected voter they could find i have to say i admire them for that they took the fight to peoples front doors while remain simply expected to win
there arent many instances where comedians ought to be asked their opinion on a cultural or political issue but free speech is one and theyll all agree that free speech is free speech as we all know that means freedom to speak in ways we might not like that not only includes political dissent but but racist and sexist language as well if were going to endlessly have this same conversation it would seem like a good idea if the people who keep acting like they think we should do something would offer a suggestion as to what specifically they think it is that we should do until then ill carry on supporting free speech and ill defend your right to speak like a bigot just as ill exercise my right to call you one
deny it a platform where possiblenoplatforming is censorship isnt it
agree with the points youre making although that colbert remark was one of the funniest ive seen stephen colbert does a fantastic job of lampooning authoritythe president and is one of the genuinely funny of course humour is subjective people on american tv i laughed a lot but i was raised on tom lehrer
ive noticed that the people who snipe about political correctness cling very very tightly to the illusion of total freedom if you bring up the topic of censorship with them for example in regards to porn it becomes almost immediately clear that they believe that this blessed state of complete and utter freedom to which they have full rights obviously actually exists it seems to me that they struggle a bit with the concept of not actually being able to do and say what you want and with the notion that total freedom of speech if unregulated could potentially encroach on my right to feel free from insults
the backlash against can you believe how often youve read that in these pages recently is the expression always necessary or accurate i have the impression that sometimes its used to preemptively inoculate what is simply contrary opinion
i strongly believe in equality for all people but words like diversity though seemingly innocent strongly enforce psychological rules that limit the free expression of the currently majority indigenous population as things stand in one generaton europe will be the majority non indigenous population i believe this fear is the heart of the issues surrounding brexit and trump i dont mean that free expression should mean hatred towards others of a different origin as we all human we should respect these differences but words like diversity has culturally connotations that are suggestive of the disappearance of one culture and its people bear in mind that those who are indigenous in  years can return to their original countries and experience the pleasures of the own cultures with only a plane ride so the fear of losing their culture isnt there i believe the fear of losing ones culture is a valid fear in  years can you go back home and experience the pleasures of your own culture being a white women
the loudest voices against sjws are white straight and male because this is one of the largest demographics in the west in case you hadnt noticed maybe you hadnt but now white straight women the other large demographic are also coming out in larger numbers against sjws even more interestingly most sjws themselves are white and often straight i notice that doesnt seem to bother you why not commentators rail against the largely imaginary threat of censorship because its easier than acknowledging that the world doesnt revolve around them odd choice of argument from the censors who are attempting to force the world to conform to their outlook the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should thats an interesting question and one i often pose to sjws why are you acting like idiots do you have no sense of nuance have you ever been taught anything besides your own preeminence and selfimportance these are questions the author and other sjws are going to have to answer
and i think we need to reminded yet again that refusing to host someones platform is not censorship and it most definitely is not restricting freedom of speech quite apart from the fact that noplatforming is used to bully smaller groups from offering a platform eg the campus tories who want to host milo what is striking is how much this argument has in common with the extreme libertarian view that it is fine for businesses to discriminate against customers refusing to serve black or gay people for example on the grounds that private institutions have no particular obligation to offer their services to people im sure you wouldnt agree with the latter position but its philosophically quite close to what youre advocating
the real test for the left is when the muslim constituency realises they are large enough to form their own religiously based party that is more representative and they dont need the labour party to speak on their behalf then the fun will start when the left have to pick apart and critique an ideology they have been defending as the political wind blows from one direction to another
to use your other point if there was a university debate on the shape of the planet then a flatearther absolutely should be invited lol no that way madness lies
im thankful that i come from that critical and skeptical generation that questions everything and believes nothing think your yourself but dont be a kneejerk contrarian
well for every vagina encountered theres more often than not some dick lurking around nearby 
but we were involved by  when the buf was banned
most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing hmmm then why did us voters unexpectedly swing towards someone who whatever his many obvious faults stands directly against pcness
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed this was a reasonable piece from the author it dealt with the issues of polarised rhetoric which is very prevalent in todays emotionally ridden discourse it also tackled the issues of personal responsibility when considering offending others but also that such speech must be protected at all costs however it fell into a journalistic laziness and stereotyping when it asserted the above if the author is going to make such a claim she should know more than anyone that evidence must be provided to support it
if you honestly believe the holocaust didnt happen and you say so how is that hate speech you can believe that amp say so without hating anyone without even disliking anyone
an obvious impact is when people lose jobs for saying a wrong thing or for the way it was said the less obvious impact is that it affects minorities as a gay man i am not only oppressed by direct rightwing homophobia the lefts impact is more harmful because it attempts to linguistically reshape and oppress me my sexual preferences are constantly put under suspicion being gay is becoming less acceptable because we are supposedly exclusionary towards women our culture is under attack by both the left and the right look at what happened to milo no defense from the left from that old chestnut lie that just because someone is gay it means hes a paedophile
if you dontt agree try rationalising your position rather than foaming incoherently
we slaughtered nazis because they started invading other countries not because we disliked their views we did it for both reasons hence why we didnt settle for simply kicking them out of other countries but crushed them in their own as well
oh well if people agree it must be fine no idea that lots of people agreed with has ever done any harm
its good you also noticed that the brexit alf garnetts prefer to stay in the uk its not just they got comfy on their sofa and feel such a neutral preference the ones i know are actively xenophobic and disinterested in johnny foreigner any further than his pouring him another drink on his package holiday so despite most rational remainers agreeing that its not racist biggoted xenophobic knuckle dragging etc etc to not atomatically accept that mass immigration is always a good thing you are one of the few that sticks to the old lies because you enjoy putting other people down
free speech that praises paedophilia there is a line red carpets shouldnt be rolled out for such speakers so how do we discuss and decide where that line is to be drawn presumably by hearing arguments for moving it in one direction or another
im not sure yiannopolous says anything particularly outrageous hes basically a piss poor stand up comedian with good hair he likes black cock and there is no such thing as a lesbian hilarious if youve never left your mothers basement if he was a red nosed old man in a rural boozer mouthing off about immigrants and islam no one would care
sometimes they do as with the stoning of adulteresses but what you are asking us to do now is to redefine our sense of gender and ironically violate womens real safe spaces you think saluting the end of stoning of adulteresses was instantaneous liberalism has to work at these causes for generations how long did it take to win the battle for gay rights how sure were people like you that the left was on its own on that one that gay marriage would never be a thing that homosexuality itself was perverse to the point of being criminal the left has every reason to believe it can win this one eventually too this is just air headed drivel and seems to wish islam to be something that it isnt or to behave other than how it has behaved no its based on a reasonable expectation based on the way other similar religions have been watered down over the years and the fact that muslims already live peacefully alongside us in the west becoming more liberal in the process no im not and you dont get to decide what is extreme on my behalf i get to decide what i think is sufficiently extreme that it lies outside the ambit of reasonable contrasting productive viewpoints and thus which views i will fight to exclude the view that islam is irredeemable is one of them you do and say what you like and i will respond with whatever tools and powers i have to either compromise with or exclude your views depending on what they are and what i think of them
no its not a solution its a deterrent people who harbour ideas they their random ticket in the genetic lottery should grant them some prominent status in the world at the expense of others should be aware that seeking to further that view will get them hurt
agree completely also very concerning is the continual watering down of words that used to actually generate a genuinely shocked reaction in people it started with the watering down of the word hatred then came bigotry racism fascism rape misogyny now were witnessing the complete watering down of the label nazi and lets be serious once that word has lost all meaning theres not much lower you can go is there
for starters chris morris for mains all satiredesserts standup comedy ports amp coffees pretty much all serious comedy in fact michael mcintyre serving as the obvious exception proving the rule yeah lets stifle all prodders of sanctimonious idiocy theyre just bollocks
youd probably get moderated for it anyway
there is only silence when the comments remain unopened on the guardians milo polemics this week look elsewhere on social media
the point is that you can attack the brexiters in these pages people are offensive to brexiters all the time if the brexiters do not like it they can moan about it both are examples of freedom of speech no platforming or demanding that art galleries are closed down is different they are attempts to prevent free speech
the worry is that such overprotected students wont be able to get jobs outside of the public sector a left leaning political think tank or the guardian fine for those that do but those having to look for work the commercial world because the above posts are full or they would like to get paid decent money are being disadvantaged on the upside it may benefit young people who chose not to go to university
including violence
i did not say that speech has no effects or consequences i said that it not equivalent to physical violence as this author and many pc advocates claim free speech is important for any society for at least two reasons  no one can claim knowledge of the absolute truth so better have more opinions than fewer  it is the selfcorrection mechanism of societies if things go the wrong way and at the same time no free and honest discussion can be had then society is doomed to a long period of suffering see the history of any totalitarian regime for examples
as youve made up this little scenario it can end however youd like but as evidence it only shows your own prejudice
no the acting wouldnt be honest i probably also agree with your reaction but its not as if youd be selling your soul to the prince of lies but it was on a crowded bus you were among strangers gauging the meanings and backgrounds of the whole complex of our macro and micro communications among strangers is an imperfect science and perhaps once a month or whatever therell be someone misunderstanding someone or taking things the wrong way it just happens we humans were wonky but not necessarily bad
so by that logic you cool if i insult your entire family you have kids mind if i say horrible things to them how old are they have you taught them well enough theres no line here by your logic so its all cool right
wow i didnt know that i think this is part of the problem as certain groups in this country do seem to have a perpetual victim mentality which is heavily nurtured with the help of some political ideologies
do you think its a microaggression if believers of a religion believe that nonbelievers are less worthy people and less liked by their deity im pretty sure it is since frankly its likely to affect their whole attitude on some small level
the answer to attempts to censor whether from left or right is go fuck yourself
comments on this article will shortly close thank you for your contributions
case marking in german is negligible between nominative and accusative and word order is in practice quite standardised and a major factor in comprehension
i fully agree as another poster says below about equality want equality practice it until the bad meaning fades out of the words and as you say sexualizing language is a poor way of achieving progress
exactly and youve put your finger squarely on the root of all this fuss the problem is not about denotation what words mean but about connotation what images they conjure up
thank god
its been a feature of nearly every language between bangladesh and portugal for thousands of years and has only very loose correlation with social gender problems its not even close to the main issue otherwise turkey would be a paradise if gender equality
its good to see that in this age of over correctness and the watering down of ideals and traditions that at least the french language can withstand the onslaught why should a centuries old language be brought to its knees because people are either too lazy to learn it properly or a select few are offended they have to abide buy a rule that was not dictated by themselves the anglo world loves to sing about how progressive they are about their nongender specific language but all they do is sexualise language
what is fascinating is that a feature of an entire language family that is conserved over thousands of years and hundreds of different languages died out so quickly in one member its hard to find anything truly unique about the situation that explains it
plenty of languages have a regulated standard form and a more rapidly changing colloquial form each used for different purposes it works just fine fossilisation whatever that actually would mean is not a practical issue
as some may have noted recent guardian articles have excised the term actress in favour of the more palatable actor hmm we could ask is ballerina next to be whitelisted for exorcism or is it after nigger kaffir to become another bword this welcome to a brave new gender neutralized world is pornographic and as robert smith sang we must fight this sickness
just like brits are not europeans as the nightly weatherperson points to the continental part of europe and says and there in europe the fantasy life of little gb goes on and on
and yet a woman friend was addressed as madame linspecteur
and the académie wins some loses some the won softwarelogiciel but lost emailcourriel
any oppression has come from a british government not the english people however much you want to make the two synonymous and no dominance in voting is no justification for the generalisation in most cases scottish welsh and northern irish mps were voting on these matters in the same direction of their own will
maybe brits are just starting to speakwrite the english that is international which of course is american rooted not brit
congratulations you are
finnish hungarian turkish mandarin are all more genderfree than any indo european language its certainly not an anglosaxon phenomenon at all
sorry that was just sloppy
he is referring to the personal pronouns ilselles and other gender markings eg on adjectives these still matter in the plural and masculine forms are used for any mixed group
base ball the ball once ftruck offaway flies the boyto the next deftind postand then home with joy the pretty little pocket book john newbery london  sounds like he scored a home run to me
scots is just bad english
just ditch gender altogether what is the point
its doctor lady
it would be same in reverse if the language of britain were still welsh or visitors had to speak gaelic in scotland and ireland the russians and other slavic peoples would probably be the only ones to manage
well the canadians hadnt invented basket ball by then so they had to have something to keep them happy 
a bit hypocritical to say british in this context after all the english have done their utmost to suppress gaelic or to civilize scots as if it were a corrupted version of english rather than a separate language i doubt you speak for them and no our heads dont explode quite as easily it is you who doesnt respect the fact that some of them may prefer to call themselves simply scottish or irish for example rather than british
the french language is already  complications which serve no useful function
its also because native english ignore wrong grammar if they understand the meaning everyone knows what how i go to means even if its completely wrong but in languages which unlike english are not analytic the endings matter the only difference between you it and s he may be a simple s sound at the end so english is great for simple communication getting round in restaurants transport etc
une maire not une mairesse who is only the spouse of the mayor well in québec mairesse is the recommended form for an elected woman and maire for an elected man very simple and efficient
you spoiled that with sens
unlike english which is a natural language more like a hero sandwich ill have some latin on that a bit of greek side order of norse saxon yes a nice bit of saxon er lots of normandy french smear of italian good bit of german oh and can we spice it up with a dose of hindi and dont forget the gaelic i said gaelic not garlic what do you think i am some kind of bloody foreigner yum
not all people say both because many people consider rightly that words in ess referring to professions have a demeaning connotation this connotation is clearer in words like poetess authoress and manageress which are now all but obsolete but it also exists in actress which is now on its way out too theres no earthly reason why we should have doctor and translator but not actor as genderneutral profession names
resisting reality is not a virtue but im sure the chinese are itching to learn french as does the rest of the world oh i forgot weve been there already and the world was even more wretched then than it is today
i like the term fuckwittery and shall see if i can use it in a conversation this weekend probably try to shoehorn it into an argument about brexit
but it should be as doctor is i think you are referring to empress but why should it be empress as a word has a long history and is convenient when distinguishing emperors and empresses in dynastic overviews there is no such equivalent for doctor so the question doesnt arise there
no im afraid not what amuses me to no end is that noun genders are not even consistent across romance languages even when they clearly have the same latin root i grew up speaking a romance language so the fact that inanimate objects have grammatical genders is not particularly odd to me but of course i wonder why those genders sometimes change in other languages if theres any logic to it it has to be morphological rather than semantic
thought it was ganders and geese not ganders and bullseveryday i learn a little more
sorry everyone has their own view  not there that was just typing
dont forget lady boy 
 everyone is not a plural noun which is correct everyone is here or everyone are here seems like a good point sir however as i said everyone is a collective noun that means that it is in the form singular but in the matter plural hence some slippage into related plurals is natural and acceptable of course as you know the answer to your question as posed is everyone is here but because of the sliding quality of a collective noun you may say it seems to me everyone has his own view  genderbias or everyone has his or her own view or collectively everyone has there own view you have probably come across all of these in the context of good english writing
that sounds quite anglophobic
oh speaking of baseball this is a gem for nearly a hundred years after it was coined soccer was an uncontroversial alternative to football often in colloquial and juvenile contexts but also in formal speech and writing in the late twentieth century some speakers of british english began to deprecate soccer for reasons that remain unclear soccer was a term used by the upper class whereas the working and middle class preferred the word football as the upper class lost influence in british society from the late s on football supplanted soccer as the accepted word there is evidence that the use of soccer is declining in britain since the early twentyfirst century the peak association football bodies in soccerspeaking australia and new zealand have actively promoted the use of football to mirror international usage and at least in the australian case to rebrand a sport that had been experiencing difficulties both bodies dropped soccer from their names these efforts have met with considerable success in new zealand httpsenwikipediaorgwikinames_for_association_footballthe_reaction_against_soccer let it be known across the land that soccer is not an americanism
we already have im a professional translator and i often use theytheirthem as gender neutral forms because it is increasingly the norm well im not going to divulge what i do but that is not a good reason so im sorry but i wouldnt employ you as a translator its a completely unnecessary aberration in contemporary language
it is dubious that the baseball of  is the same game as american baseball or just a game that involved bases and balls like rounders baseball is like footballsoccer the rules didnt exist until the th century and it came out of several different random childrens games
on the use of the word gotten just seeing the word is enough to set the hair of some british english speakers on end yet despite the many claims that it is an americanism it is most definitely of british origin and the oxford english dictionary traces its first use to the th centuryapr   i think gotten in some sentences sounds much better i like to use it
if only we could 
can anybody explain why its la verge and le vagin personally im with our saxon ancestors who sat around in their mud huts and said screw our norman overlords with their les and las lets desexualise our language insofar as we can without the help of early th century mores or words to that effect
its not an idea it is a fact etymologyedit from middle english sterre from old english steorra star from protogermanic sternô sternǭ star from protoindoeuropean h₂stḗr star old english steorra of germanic origin related to dutch ster german stern from an indoeuropean root shared by latin stella and greek astēr 
if it is a woman it would become maîtresse we have the same problem in english is a female master a mistress imagine a mistressofarts a mistressatarms a mistress tailor
inclusive writing has no place in the countrys grammar books or anywhere else for that matter quite right
the french can try to resist but you know theyll surrender sooner or later
what is sexist is having a group of  women and  man in a group and then using the masculine les to refer to the group in that case youre not just using gender but giving the male dominance not really les is defined as the plural not the masculine plural french does not have separate feminine and masculine plural definite articles nor for that matter does german die is the plural for all genders
yeah i dont know how foreigners put up with british tourists never being able to learn the local language theyre like americans but dont tip as well

well with trump the brexit and the rise of china where speaking english is not an option i guess the sun is setting on the english parentèse you brought us the most destructive form of capitalism there ever was and your industrial revolution made it possible to scale up wars at an unprecedented level of mass destruction so yes the french are resisting your unigenderisation trend and as it happens most of the world is now resisting your trends and your food oh no i forgot british food is the best according to british rankings

in a statement full of hyperbole the academy condemned the increasing use of new spellings aimed at making written french less masculine arguing that it could not see the desired objective of the changes there is absolutely nothing hyperbolic about the statement as french officialese goes its very mild and what is so odd about desired objective that it requires ation marks i would say the journalist has not been very objective themself
as mr twain pointed out in german a turnip has sex die rübe feminine but a girl doesnt das mädchen neuter this is one of the things that makes english so easy no grammatical gender others are no cases except whom no declensions no adjectival agreement every simple verb declension on the downside native english speakers therefore have a very hard time coming to grips with these features of foreign languages
yes at least a bit of sense remains somewhere
english has thrived for many reasons and i dont think its simply due to american power english displaced french as a european second language for many reasons but more than anything would be the popularity of the beatles and the rise of swinging england in the s britain became enormously popular as indeed it still is and younger people all wanted to learn english this helped make it a lingua franca in europebesides that it is a language spoken all over the world due to the british empire it is in fact the third most spoken first language as a second language much more widely spoken
which confuses everyone because the lords prayer says thou so people think its more formal that you people dont realize that its actually using the familiar form to emphasize the close relation to god
because schleswigholsteinsonderburgglücksburg is such a pain when you try and fill in an online form
some english dialects do have a second person plural pronoun youse
actually you is originally plural like french vous italian voi what dropped out was the familiar thou thats because of our famous civility where all are addressed using the polite form

all jobs should be gender neutral manager doctor etc etc however its easier to go down that road because in english the article direct or indirect is gender neutral a doctor the manager the problem in france is that this has to be unune or lela
finnish has even less gender marking than english which is the reason for its astounding global popularity

the british monarchy itself is super sexist if you think about it whenever a man is king then his wife is the queen but when a woman is queen her husband is just a consort its totally messed up prince phillip cant even give his offspring his own last name
its british not just english though this makes foreigners heads explode but baseball is not despite its terms now being used frequently in the uk but i would go back to using some of the old terms lie for alttruth lying for misspeaking not sure about bigly
oh cmon i wish it were used more frequently
silly question hes a polyglot
americans speak more original english than english people do anyway most of the things that british people think are americanisms are actually older dialect forms from england that english people in england have since changed but that might make english peoples heads explode

i fully agree life and actions and attitudes create language it is silly to suggest that it works the other way round a person can be a sexist despite using genderneutral language and a nonsexist despite using traditional terminology
telling women what they can wear is not only deeply offensive to the tenets of freedom by any measure it also seems to be a favourite pastime in the culture if you are referring to the restrictions on the niqab andor burkha then i agree but ironically france does it in the name of emancipation and womens liberty you may call it a pretext for other things but many people in france including secular muslims agree with it on these grounds
if ypu write människan kommer från afrika hon började sin resa på savannen we do not have le and la styles though we have en and ett which are not based on gender we used to but a veeeery long time ago you can still find them in dialects

she is a girlboss she is a mumtrepreneur she is a sheeo he is a manterrupter a mansplainer a manspreader he is always bropropriating womens ideas she is a feminazi hes got a dadbod and the man flu what is it with the growing popularity of overtly gendered neologisms you might want to ask the editor given that the g and supporters of its approach appear to have been responsible for generating and deploying most of them note also that said gendered neologisms are all negative when applied to male behaviour and positive for female yet also somehow coming from an alleged desire for equality
from memory fanny started to be used pejorative term for a person after it became widely known that fanny in america means the same as arse
i think mansplaining is when a man has the absolute fucking cheek to explain something to a woman alternatively its a stupid word that only idiots actually use
the first should be removing men from menopause we wouldnt want that association would we
bearded clam wouldnt this confuse female children wheres the beard theyd cry have you considered the consequences to their confidence from what i read in this newspaper its at an alltime low which causes them to oh i dont know avoid science or something
this is all just trendy bs though for the underemployed middle class women the language works just fine its in constant update mode and has been now for  years and new words will come into use when they have a real purpose and meaning to a substantial number of people this attempt to shoehorn in feminist words is pointless words are in the dictionary because people use them not the other way round why not do something useful with your spare time ride a bike fly a kite run a marathon
whats the difference between mansplaining and a man explaining something
manure

my grandmother always used the term beef curtains
they should be consigned to history
manspreading and mansplaining are no more than glib sexist insults from people who demand that society takes more care with language when describing themselves
in the s there was consternation among swedes that there was a colloquial nonsexual word for penis snopp but no female equivalent and if the situation had been reversed you can be sure sweminists would have complained that the patriarchy is trivialising our bodies we demand you use the scientific terms for our genitalia
sophia amoruso set up a store trading on ebay pierre omidyar set up ebay you can muck around with words all you like but women will continue to aggregate around the mean
mumu
i dont know when it started but for as long as i can remember fanny has been used as a pejorative term for a person much the same way that just about every word for penis except willy is some people say fifi but that sounds too much like a cartoon cat or something
when me and my mates went on holiday to florida the american travel rep kept trying to sell us all fanny packshe couldnt understand why we kept laughing
ben elton did this about  years ago and also favoured fanny
manshaming no just no if feminists want a load of pathetic neologisms to make them feel better about themselves you knock yourselves out youll never make me ashamed to be a man
gash or axewound are two nonclinical nonsexual ways to talk about the vagina too but theyre both grim whereas fanny was used since i was a kid i can remember the girl next door asking to see my willy and shell show me her fanny when we were about  and sex wasnt on our minds
although i see the author is currently of the yankish persuasion as such perhaps not the best person to be writing about english in a uk newspaper one people separated by a common language and all that
theyre basically not used outside the field of gender studies which isnt an exactly balanced world view
i like fanny and vulva they are softsounding words
columnists use them not sure about anyone else
fanny
people have grappled with englishs lack of a genderneutral personal pronoun for centuries often falling back on they no they havent they was the normal way in which nongender specified individuals could be referred to from medieval times noone was grappling with anything it was a natural part of the language it was only when the grammar nazis started pretending they couldnt understand what was being said that anyone had to grapple with anything
from chick flicks to dick pics brilliant also i liked an article by mahdawi oh dear time to lie down
other than manspreading used among men towards their mates ive not actually heard anyone outside of the guardian ever use any of these terms
fanny
since society is in a rush to eliminate gender norms in language perhaps manufacture should be abolished along with mandate and manacle
our childminder used twinkle
are you sure anyone uses these words ive never heard any of them and although i live in semirural derbyshire i do read the papers and watch tv also im sure english with its rich and diverse linguistic background does not need any more descriptors for parts of the anatomy as our language has more than double the number of words that languages like swedish or french or german for that matter possessenglish is far more advanced at being genderneutral as we do not have genders for our nouns

british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina frontbottom
a decent article but this line had me scratching my head the fact that words such as boss and ceo are not actually genderneutral if its a fact can you elaborate on it ive certainly never considered either of these terms as being genderspecific even subconsciously or whatever chief executive officer sounds a bit militaryish if anything could be construed from it but it certainly doesnt sound penisish to me
sealioning was a new one thought you meant seagulling
mansplaining is when a man when talking to a woman assumes he knows more about a topic than the woman and explains it to her in a way he would never do to another man this happens but how often can you tell that they wouldnt do the same to a man and why would you need a gendered term unless you suppose women never do a similar thing man explaining something is where a man when talking to a woman assumes he knows more about a topic and explains it but would do the exact same to another man what is it called if a man when talking to a woman knows he knows more about a topic and explains it
the composite forms waepman and wifman meant adult male person and adult female person thus man means both sexes
columnists use them not sure about anyone else they seem to be very common on twitter due to the identity politics mindset being disproportionately represented on that platform
not sure what thats got to do with the article according to the article words such as boss and ceo are not actually genderneutral but implicitly coded as male that language is man made language reflects reality bosses and ceos tend to be male for the reasons feminists like you are finally being forced to admit
i didnt mean to suggest hed said he was proud just making the point that to be either ashamed or proud of something you had no control over strikes me as odd i was basically agreeing with the poster
ive never heard the term girlboss before nor has my spell checker and i must confess to being confused why is boss described as being male and willy described as nonsexual dont such statements simply reflect one individuals opinion of words and their meanings why pretend to speak for society
tch tch inhuwoperbeingity just rolls off the tongue if you please cant use the m word anywhere
my thoughts exactly indeed much gendered language is positive for females go girl girl power etc whereas its is negative re males man up man flu etc and gendered negative language used in the pejorative against females is now taboo b word etc whereas dick head etc is seen as acceptable man flu is real btw
earlier this year kosztovics called for the uk to follow swedens lead in a video on the bbc british english has the word willy but lacks a widely used nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina kosztovics says this means little girls grow up with the thought that there is something wrong between their legs this is ridiculous kosztovics is a social worker from malmö like most educated swedes i expect her english is excellent notably much better than my swedish but even so it isnt her first language the assertion that there isnt a widely used nonclinical word for vagina is ridiculous and im alarmed that the author of the column is sufficiently detached from reality to take this seriously i takes me all of  seconds to think of three suitable terms that are almost universally understood by any briton
but if you can think of any other way for me to prove it ill do so describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother
well bollocks are definitely a factor
point out any annoying habit a woman has and its misogyny
now that ive looked it up i can agree
or there is womansplaining just silence until you correctly guess the crime you have committedyes i know this is going to be deleted by the mods
feminists think a man is mansplaining when she cannot be bothered to listen to his opinions and expertise in other words she finds him boring she is boring
im pretty sure im not although i did read an article at the weekend that said were all living in a big simulation so perhaps youre right im not going to send you pictures to prove it if that was the next step by the way but if you can think of any other way for me to prove it ill do so my periods stopped about  years ago when i started taking cerazette if that counts as evidence
well put we dont need to buy into the whole venus and mars thing although there are certainly differences in behaviours and outlook between the sexes whether through nurture or nature its a long haul to change it and we certainly need to be more careful with language in the meantimehowever i think one of the authors points is that these neologisms become just another vocabulary for dissing others as pc is commonly used with uncomplimentary intent by those with a prejudice to share plus ca change plus cest la meme chose
mansplaining is when a man when talking to a woman assumes he knows more about a topic than the woman and explains it to her in a way he would never do to another man this happens man explaining something is where a man when talking to a woman assumes he knows more about a topic and explains it but would do the exact same to another man
ok to be more specific i have attended meeting s where other men are allowed to talk about their area of expertise but women are told stuff they already know about theirs which is mansplaining and i have been to meetings where everybody gets interrupted by captain knowitall which is patronising but not sexist the two are not mutually exclusive
manspreading though im sure this can be a problem on the central line at least its people overwhelmingly female who cross their legs and thereby take up the space thats designed for standing passengers who are far more selfish imo i have taken to calling that womanstretching and the phrase goes down like a lead balloon with many of the same people happy to use manspreading
i guess thats the royal we or perhaps just a plain old nosism
my girlfriend has very recently learnt the word manterrupting from youtube and now uses it whenever i try to get a word in edgeways
well thats cool if a little offtopic and i thought the dedicated word for bathroom was bathroom maybe you meant to reply to someone else
exactly it annoys me just as much to have to ask for a big smelly gym bag or grocery bags to be moved actually i must confess the physical touching that comes with this leg spreading is a little more unnerving than a bag but the rudeness is similar thankfully i manage to avoid public transport much of the time
it would seem silly to be ashamed of something you had no choice in or proud of it for that matter it just is not sure i agreeapart from the fact the poster said he was not ashamed not the same as being necessarily proud
i always thought that the clinicalnon sexual word for vagina was vagina taken from the latin vaginae meaning sheath or scabbard if people want to come up with new wordsinvent a dedicated one for bathroom as in  years the british have never managed it
you hear them quite a lot from people who read the graun and people who read blogs and quite a few who have been to university in the last ten years
manspreading is a natural position for a male to sit in that it takes the weight off the hamstrings nothing to do with equipment of course its unacceptable on a crowded bus or whatever just as having your bag placed on the empty seat beside you is
if you know any woman in their s who have been to university you will probably have heard them used and probably misused
im not saying for a minute that there arent men who condescendingly explain things to women that they know already but i have started to notice this term applied to any man who explains a point of view to a woman that she doesnt agree with which funnily enough is imo the answer to your original question whats the difference between mansplaining and a man explaining something
i thought fanny as well but wasnt sure if it was just a scottish thing or not
i think the term wifesplaining might be useful
true but only from women from the north of england never heard it from a southerner who didnt pick it up from a northerner
is it bollocks
i am female i am an expert in a particular area and am known as an expert in that area sometimes other people talk to me about that area as though they know more than me when they do not i am male i experience the same thing is this mansplaining
onomatopoeially perhaps not the nicest word and ive sometimes taken it to mean closer to muff than fanny though that maybe the use of ginge minge
along with privilege intersectionality gaslighting sealioning
that bit about the hurricanes is ridiculous those weathermen are full of crap
i always thought your fanny was your bottom male or female so fanny packs although not cool never struck me as really hilarious
scottish english has fanny
good article from now on anyone who accuses anyone else of mansplaining should get a link to this article and some time on the naughty step the same is true of the manifold vocabulary for manshaming its not manshaming though its misandry
my gf tells me roald dahl used the american style in matilda causing much childhood mirth
this is like some bad joke a world that runs around creating pointless expression as weapons to use in an artificially manufactured gender war feminism was great when it championed equality now it wants its own superiority over both men and women and now there exists a lexicon to weaponise bigotry i always believed distopian science fiction to be slightly ludicrous until i woke up in the middle of the movie
the neologisms you use to describe male behaviour are all pejorative but the ones you use in the article for females are notstrange thator not this being the graun
no no no no please pay attention the way it works with feminism is along the lines of the cakeampeatit principle it works only when it works for their benefit otherwise it doesnt work
i think this article makes some good points feminists used to insist that there were no essential differences between men and women and were committed to breaking down barriers between the sexes but with the rise of identity politics and the internet theres this really clannish idea of gender which is actually undergirded by the very essentialist discourses that feminists used to attack its all female only spaces and talk of toxic masculinity and all this trans stuff i was arguing recently with a woman who said she was a feminist who was saying that men will always be violent because of testosterone and a load of feminists were rallying behind her they were also supporting single sex schools so that girls were protected from sexually sociopathic males it never used to be like that if you look closely you actually see that much third wave gender politics is very conservative ie men are bad if you give women power theyll use it nobly because they have babies and are therefore much more nurturing and kind than men and that men and women should have their own spaces also while a culture of female sexual abuse no doubt does exist in certain forms the melodramatic and paranoic discourse of rape culture has only reinforced the notion that women are perpetual victims and males uncontrollable aggressors i dont know if anyone has heard of laura kipnis shes a leftwing feminist academic and one of the few ive got any time for recently she published an essay called sexual paranoia in academe which basically made the point i made above as a result there were a number of student complaints and she was brought up on a title iv charge a federally sanctioned process by which universities can subject those accused of sexual misconduct to a kind of internal kangaroo caught except kipnis hadnt committed sexual misconduct shed just written an essay which some students felt created a chilling effect eventually she was exonerated but only after undergoing a kafkaesque nightmare her book about the experience is just out theres a good piece by her and an interview below httpwwwnationalreviewcomarticlerapeculturedebateamericanacademialaurakipnisattackssexualparanoiacampus httpsmyoutubecomwatchvluoujoo i dont want to attack feminism out of hand many basic principles to of which are of course right but something has gone a screwy with a large t of lately and rather than improving relations between the sexes its creating a lot of tension fear conflict and paranoia
my teenaged sons pepper their conversations with some of these words not the business ones like sheeo for obvious reasons but feminazi and the like were in a midsize canadian city

mansplainmanˈspleɪnverbinformalgerund or present participle mansplainingof a man explain something to someone typically a woman in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizingim listening to a guy mansplain economics to his wife
i am female i call robot
much of this is feminisms fault naturally glad we settled that i agree
i dont use the term but i think the perfect example of it can be seen under articles about pregnancy and periods where without fail one will see men repeatedly and inaccurately try to explain these female bodily functions to multiple women who are disagreeing with him
only ever heard that in perth
i think mansplaining is a man explaining something to a female person even though she knows it already i think that was the original version though even that is sexist as its hardly something that females are incapable of towards men just listen to descriptions from fathers especially single fathers of how theyre often treated by women when they are out and about with their kids but without a female chaperone due to the sexism and massive hypocrisy of much loud modern feminism it quickly morphed into professorawesomes version
theres dozens of them i think theyre quite regional trouble with fanny is that it means arse in the us so confusions reigns if you use it for ladyparts
i think its better to refrain from pronouncing the hypotheticals you create inside your own mind as some kind of cogent argument or fact you add nothing and merely expose the depth of your prejudice
everybody will thats the nature of the mean but women typically have a lower standard deviation of characteristics like intelligence than men so you get more male outliers at both ends of the spectrum not sure what thats got to do with the article mind
never quite grasped das mädchen
you hear quite a lot of bollocks in the graun that you dont hear anywhere else
i know a perfect example of a woman that claims to be only trying to help when she is saying something that is already known yet when it is the other way round the person is called a know it all
i am female i am an expert in a particular area and am known as an expert in that area sometimes other people talk to me about that area as though they know more than me when they do not  of the time it is men that talk to me this way this is an example of mansplaining incidentally ive managed to get the frequency of this right down by leaving a little silence then saying i know in the coldest voice i can muster when theyve quite finished its got me a rep as a cold hard bitch but id rather be that than regularly patronised which was what was happening before
if its any consolation this feminist has never even heard the term
and women never condescendingly explain things to men that they already know i think they do
and in languages like french and german youve got the opposite problem people insist you should always mention both genders rather than using one as a neutral option dear teachers gt liebe lehrer und lehrerinnen dear students gt liebe studierende those who are studying rather than malefemale students its just incredibly clumsy and very amusing it leads to jokes like this translating roughly a farmerfarmeress has  potatoes and potatoesses if one sack or sackess holds  potatoes or potatoesses how many sacks or sackesses does the farmer farmeress need
didnt get beyond the headline huh
did they come in different colours
exactly were both just as bad get on the bus and see a woman or a man on the end seat blocking the window seat sometimes with their bags
it would seem silly to be ashamed of something you had no choice in or proud of it for that matter it just is
its almost always women who are rude and inconsiderate in public place for example i was walking with my wife on the pavement a few days ago and a young woman behind me took hold of the bag i was carrying and used it to move me bodily out of her path so she could get passed
words like mansplaining whilst perhaps useful to describe a phenomena as a whole are i believe useless when is comes to individual accusations there is no better way to signal you have no interest in a grown up argument than to accuse someone of mansplaining its unfalsifiable for a start
oh the inhuwomanity of it all
during sexed in school the first thing teacher asked all of us if we knew alternate words after that he asked the girls which they prefer vagina won
we played a company football tournament in france the french powerleague rep began by announcing to everyone no tackling is allowed at which point about  semidrunk english and irish players all started mimicking politely asking each other if they could have the ball he insisted  times before he finally conceded there may have been a loss in translation and all he meant was no slide tacking
welly top
we are more aware of the problems of gendered language than ever i guess thats the royal we
berkshire hunt or granny flat
well you were warned
and back in the real world
allow me to womansplain the problem with gendered language no thank youthis is as clumsy and nonsensical as any other sexplaining
english is actually pretty good in terms of gendering of language compare it to say french where every single thing is either male of female
manspreading is probably down to the seats being made too small
nunny
i think mansplaining is a man explaining something to a female person even though she knows it already like the old saying mansplaining your grandma to suck eggs
 at the same time however we seem to be creating a new gendering of language as the popularity of words such as mansplain and girlboss demonstrate  good article the term mansplain needs to be binned immediately
im not saying for a minute that there arent men who condescendingly explain things to women that they know already but i have started to notice this term applied to any man who explains a point of view to a woman that she doesnt agree with
the same is true of the manifold vocabulary for manshaming words such as manspreading or mansplaining are or at least they were useful they really arent this whole manspeading craze is just bonkers its as if men are the only inconsiderate people on public transport bollocks
yep toss them all down the nearest personhole
now you know its impossible to be sexist against men the author and fellow feminists keep telling us so 
i dont mind if i do
ive always thought mini was the nonclinical nonsexual way to talk about the vagina but what do i know im just a man
frontbum
feminism
minge
its a bit gross but my brother always used to use the term split arse
probably just whether its in agreement with her or not
yes im not really sure i dont think though that theyre using it but rather there are some things that you cant say if you want power i think to criticise this as being a problem does undermine political correctness though
or even language o
using or condoning racist language is wrong that isnt the same as someone being obnoxious though fabricant and delingpole were being obnoxious oldman on the other hand was defending racism
im gary oldman you might remember me from public apologies such as jews gods chosen people and gays are aok im here today to talk about my latest role as jock on scottish televisions take the high road
the point is that the original definitions of the ism words are far removed from how people currently use them eg for the n word to be racist you actually have to believe that black people are an inferior race for calling someone a faggot you have to actually believe that someones homosexuality is wrong for something to be antisemetic you have to actually believe all jews are bad this is what racism actually is calling people out on the basis of facts is not actually racist if you think there are too many eu immigrants and the vast majority of those immigrants are poles then it is totally fair to say i think there are too many poles if you are criticizing zionism logically you must be criticizing jews as jews because it is exclusively a jewish thing but it is not racist to do so if you think gay men marrying women and then realizing they are gay and leaving their wife is a wrong thing you can only criticize gay men qua gay men as if they werent gay they would not do that particular thing
its better that people like oldman speak in the way he did we now know what he thinks if hed kept his mouth shut hed still be thinking the same things
lamguage is important our rulers have long recognised that even if you do not wwwyoutubecomwatchveimmbephfe
lola get over it what a humourless rant
gary oldman said those words yes but not in the order presented in the none soundbites as presented here the fing jewngger e was in response to being asked about mel gibson the full e is below he got drunk and said a few things but weve all said those things were all fg hypocrites thats what i think about it the policeman who arrested him has never used the word n or that fg jew im being brutally honest here its the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy on calling gay men faggots he was responding to being asked about alec baldwin alec calling someone an fag in the street while hes pissed off coming out of his building because they wont leave him alone i dont blame him on calling women in power useless cnts was in fact in response to the fact that some people get away with such language but he could not if i called nancy pelosi a c and ill go one better a fucking useless c i cant really say that but bill maher and jon stewart can and nobodys going to stop them from working because of it so yeah he really didnt do himself any favours in the interview but he categorically did not say what this blogger said he did does that mean all is forgiven no not really he should maybe think of a better way of putting his points across but to present what this blog did as es which were in no way es of his is just as bad in my view
yes but are his friends electric
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense which is correct pc has silence fact and debate so it isnt insensitive to particular groups take douglas murray or richard dawkins how many times have people attempted to silence debate or research by these two because its insensitive to x or y pc and freedom of speech and expression are not compatible with one another
political correctness is basically just cultural marxism the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms
political correctness is a phrase which simply describes one application of what we used to know as politeness this stemmed from having enough self respect to respect others those who hanker for the good old days where you could slag off anyone and they ought to be able to laugh it off usually miss the good old days when people seemed a bit more polite future shock cognitive dissonance
 these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman coincides with a jewish cemetary in manchester being vandalised and antisemitic graffiti and swastikas daubed over gravestones was that meant as a joke httpwwwbbccouknewsukenglandmanchester outbursts from oldman and gibson add fuel to the fire of despicable behaviour
i was thinking about that paragraph as well is the point she is making is the right is using pc to advance its aims so something must be wrong here 
we didnt have all this political correctness malarkey when i was growing up we just had good manners ummm come to think of it seems to amount to pretty much the same thing
fact of the day gary oldman is younger than gary numan
well well gary sounding rather stupid arent we finally the tongue reflects the madness within is there anything more pathetic than those quixotic outbursts against political correctness
that is mutually exclusive and mutually repugnant
you can say what ever you want if you offend someone dont be surprised when people get angrythats it
id say political correctness and gary oldman are two sides of the same coin
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures okey dokey
its either pc gone mad or someone complaining about how you cant say x any more before going on to say just that for me political correctness is little more than basic politeness which makes your following point interesting if not something i can quite agree with the right has consistently trounced political correctness but many adept rightwing politicians regularly use it to their advantage nick griffin and nigel farage at least in public utilise the language of political correctness to appear measured and reasonable yet this does not mean that their politics are progressive they may be doing this although id question really how far they are but isnt that good to a certain extent that there are some things that people would find offensive if said and so theres a certain pressure not to say them for them not to become part of the popular discourse of course that doesnt reflect what is in the minds of others but i dont think we can or should ever police what people think its enough for most of us that we dont make a point of offending others that doesnt mean of course that we cant challenge the negative policies that they put forward but im glad that at the very least its not considered okay for politician to say overtly offensive stuff when pushing those policies one step at a time
yay a bita humor
gary oldman said all that astonishing i guess ukip have their a list backer now how utterly depressing
oldman has since apologised but his outburst reveals just how far resistance to political correctness has gone really i dont think so more than anything it shows how breathtakingly dim and removed from real life hollywood actors are
what do you expect from someone who hijacked air force one
i am fine to accept that there has been hypocrisy on the conservative as well as the liberal side here my point is that the grassroots support for milo will throw up the welcoming climate for george takeis comments on positive sexual experiences as a gay teen under the age of consent alongside the understanding liberal reaction to lena durhams somewhat queasy confessions of her sexual activity as a very young child what we have here is a major culture war where the condemnation of milo has come from a huge grassroots swell irrespective and i think regardless of traditional liberal media mouthpieces they have largely steered clear apart from the character assassination pieces in the guardian with all his groteque excesses and showbiz trappings my has clearly become a major enemy to the liberal social cause 
good work poirot if facts have to be bent and scientific research abused to such an extent one wonders if any credibility remains it could have the effect of convincing ppl fundamentally to disagree with the premise of the article though given i do disagree with it im not well placed to comment
a woman phoned in the show whose father was among the british forces who liberated belsen she said he had nightmares about it for the rest of his life
exercising my alleged right to be offensive for a moment the country is currently in thrall to the kind of twonker who goes on holiday to spain and will only eat fried fish and chips ill excercise my right to say that kind of stereotyping is bigoted and no less so than if i were to suggest let alone actually believe that all remainers want fom to keep the lowest paid as low paid as possible so that they can have the cheapest cleaners car washers nannies etc
it is neoliberal media policy that brought us here or the likes of thatcher and blair brought us the likes of hopkins and yiannopoulos remember the phrase legitimate concerns the british backlashthousands now mobilising in protest against the immigrant invasion those were the frontcover headline and subhead from march edition of spearhead the far rightwing magazine edited by john tyndall how come that just a decade later the john tindall if alive would surely become a regular guest on morning politics in alternations with nigel farage someone may say gordon brown is the guilty one for saying bigoted woman and not poor woman brainwashed by bigoted media he could not say so because he and his previous boss tony blair both owed to such media it was the very same media wot won for them three times not him or his previous boss now someone may say that it is not the media who are bigoted they just print what the public wants to read well that halfblinded marketoriented view on media is what brought us where we are since media has the power to create the publics reading wants and it does all the time it is not a henoregg dilemma so it is not the freedom of speech principle what made typical cryptonazi scapegoating a uk mainstream today it is the market orientation ideological dogmatism therefore guardian when you oppose mrs hopkins right to call people cockroaches you jeopardise the uk economy as is now
moderated comments on an article about free speech must be the ultimate oxymoronfor fear of failing to get the censors nod i will not commenttom robinson said it best in his non pc power in the darkness if i knew how to i would put a link to youtube but i dont
that used to be called common decency where did that go
warming to it myself but personally i think abi wilkinson should blaze the trail 
first genuine laugh ive had all day you are a king among men curtis
you are clutching at straws we werent at war in  when the public order act was enshrined
censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger who do you think you are kidding
theres a difference between freedom of speech and being a self hating cbomb
the trouble is this is such a slippery slope everyone wants ridiculous political correctness to end like trying to call xmas trees winter trees or changing the colour of bah bah black sheep so as not to cause offense most people should however agree that the calling of refugees cockroaches that need stamping out by gunboats as something completely unacceptable the trouble is people keep feeding the likes of katie hopkins and piers morgan oxygen
we live in a world full of dicks ive seen quite a lot of vaginas mate thats a fact
brilliant thoughtful and thought provoking this could have been a guardian article
attack noxious ideas and hateful speech and deny it a platform where possible but do not encroach on freedom of speech that is just not the right route these things must be countered not censored
well yes because we were involved in world war ii and the buf were an obvious threat to national security due to their open sympathy for our enemies if we became involved in a world war against a genuinely threatening islamic caliphate and the muslim council of britain declared for the caliphate im sure the government would ban it and throw its leading members in jail too things work differently when youre involved in a potentially existential struggle
i dont care what milo feels this isnt about his feelz but how society as a wider thing judges him if society judges him an arsehole then he loses the influence he has overall you will see this in his recent fall he is simply less relevant now than he was a mere week ago that is what is important now how he or his supporters see themselves
unless you are inciting imminent violence or criminal activity free speech should be regarded as absolute so not absolute then
of course if bame is too exclusive we could always use the term human unfortunately it is also the first two syllables of humanism so i cant see the graun adopting it no lines in it dividing us up into our little identity clubs
you seriously had no idea there was a riot at berkeley well there was kind of torpedoes your pithy comeback doesnt it
the people in the relevant positions of authority make a decision theres the problem as for your example im not sure it helps what line has been crossed i ask because if it is defending or appearing to defend sex with minors then bill maher has said the same thing and he still has a tv chat show
i dont have a problem with racist and misogynist speech as long as the backlash against it is also protected
the people who bang on about political correctness gone mad just want to be absolved of any responsibility for the things they say and do free speech is not freedom from responsibility for the thing you say you shout fire in a theater expect to be talking to the police afterwards likewise you stir up racial hatred its going to have a cost in how society treats you
how amusing this is a far more intelligent way of saying and a more advanced theory of what i was alluding to aright above
shes an opinion columnist these people make a living out of sketching around the issues while never actually proposing or endorsing any particular course of action
im thankful that i come from that critical and skeptical generation that questions everything and believes nothing im convinced that all this fake scaremongering false flags and crying wolf is all about producing people that are so scared and timorous that when they are confronted with the real threat that is heading their way they will crumple and curl up into a ball while being steamrollered into the ground they have been carefully and permanently imprinted with such fear and self loathing they might even think they deserve it they will put up little or no resistance on current evidence in fact they will only campaign or march for the very system that wants them gone they are so brainwashed
i dont support all the safe spaces bs but just likeglobal warming i dont have much time for people who try amp peddle false information to further their own agendas incitement to racial hatred is a crime in this country am i right
the backlash is simply exploiting the absurdities of dogmatic political correctness to roll back minority rights recently i have noticed a profusion of youtube vids deriding trans people who seem to be the easytarget focus of this rather organised backlashalso a lot of vids expounding on the scientific fact of black mental inferiority which social justice warriors are in denial about typical check it out for yourselffrightened conservatives are at heart spineless authoritarians shocked by the disobedience of nonconformity those who do not obey the rulers are an enemy dangerously provoking the displeasure of said rulersthey want progressive trends back in their boxes or in jail
well i refer you to my answer to welshmorgan for me if there is no deliberate intention to be offensive or hurtful there is no harm done and i dont think the whole acting thing would be very honest
fantastic post papers like the guardian who have refused to have honest discussions about difficult topics have created a vacuum which has been gleefully filled by milo hopkins et al
yes opposition to political correctness is often motivated by a desire to condone prejudice and systemic discrimination however we should not ignore some of the issues that arise when some people take on opinions in order to subscribe to an orthodoxy rather than because they have thought them through benign racism is one of those issues for example not wanting to criticise barack obama because he is africanamerican or the homogenisation implicit in an aversion to criticising jihadist atrocities because one feels that criticism might be mistaken for criticism of muslims in general the common interpretation of the macpherson principle whereby for example labour mp ruth smeeths subjective perception of an incident as antisemitic is treated as qed these kneejerk and broadbrush responses do not characterise what those on the right mean when they refer to political correctness but unfortunately they are not entirely marginal either
i expect all the varieties of bullying both verbal and physical will have a large part to play
the balance of power is important even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impactsadly though students dont stay on campus forever eventually they graduate and find jobs as hr or diversity managers or journalists positions where they finally can inflict their views upon the unenlightened population a lot of the nonsense that is going on campus today will have seeped into corporate culture and the general public in a decade or so
completely agree kizbot the milo thing shows what happens when knowall sjws try to shout down the opposition milo is now massive and everytime he is censored his book deal gets pulled etc he just gets more kudos the shoutybutuseless left have made him what he always wanted to be notorious and probably quite wealthy i know too many people who are on the side of remain the side i voted for who are utterly deluded in their selfimportance and unable to understand why people find them repellent not only did they view the eu referendum as a done deal  stay one predicted the day of the vote but saw it as a way to talk down to the great unwashed they viewed as cattle but lets not pretend the left and i use the term loosely as main of the supposed current leftists are someway to the right of edward heath are the only side blighted with such people for every laci greene hyperventilating on youtube there is a roaming millennial doing the similar often from the opposite side of the same argument for every remoaner having a hissy fit there is a brexitteer claiming that  equals a landslide and will of the people so all debate should be shut down
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening anyone wishing to explore the evidence which the author hasnt been able to find might be interested in this link to the free speech university rankings httpwwwspikedonlinecomfreespeechuniversityrankingswkfofmnzqa
i would but i find your use of the full stop overly didactic who says you get to decide when the discussion is over i dont remember there being a vote did i miss a meeting did i really fight the paragraph wars for this
unlike the genuinely worrying authoritarianism of theresa mays government which is backed up with political power as has been pointed out on a number of occasions the review of the official secrets act was begun under david cameron and all that has happened so far is that certain proposals have been put forward by the independent law commission and have only been through an initial consultation phase with a second phase to be opened in april to use this to level claims of genuinely worrying authoritarianism against mays government is simply false reporting
its perfectly possible to believe people should have the right to say horrible things while questioning their decisions to do so and thats exactly the crux of the matter policing should only be done by loudly voicing counter opinions to bigoted microagressions ie in a social sense policing should never be institutionalzed in any way such as through noplatforming or similarly creepy actions unless such speech is deemed to cause a certain level of harm or incite hatred or violence in any case for the most part bigotry about race sexuality etc is decreasing all the time although the obsession with race in the us is worrying but freedom of speech is sacrosanct the alternative would be much worse indeed also for those minorities of which you speak
do notrad fems are your sheila jeffries julie burchill dworkin no make up no heels no men political lesbianis bossy boots telling women what to wear who to fuck and how to think entirely the same as men but bossieri dont need a bossthank goodness feminism is a broad church
a no not alwaysb i think its a bad idea and theres a clear power imbalance in such relationships although some might feel it was of benefit from my own point of view its something i probably would have said yes to but i wouldnt have had the emotional maturity to make that an informed decision as to whether it did him in i think hes said worse and i think most ideas should be able to be discussed and as ive said elsewhere people who write for this paper have said the same thing about such relationships or male pupils having affairs with female teachers what stands out for me is the silence of those who proclaim to be defenders of free speech particularly where they have previously defended milo
this whole debate has got daft people wanting to rewrite history by taking down statues safe spaces so that certain views are not allowed and offensiveracist sexist tags thrown at people regularly primark and bojo just the latest daft examples come on everyone lets be outraged and offended everyday at everything printed or said it will be so much fun journalists have brought this madness on us and it will hide the very serious examples which do need to be challenged
agreed it was a revolting article genuine liberal principles are in short supply at the guardian
obsession with blame is such selfserving pettiness
if it is indeed every couple of weeks then why is the linked example from two years ago
you dont harm people with speech well yes you can you most certainly can ask any psychologist or psychiatrist you seem very angry youre angry as a result of my post itself a very innocuous vanilla thing you demonstrate by your unwarranted hostility that simple words can invoke strong emotions even when that was not the desired effect strong negative emotions can have a very detrimental effect on physical health ask any doctor i wasnt asking you to check your privilege clearly the word privilege is something of a trigger for you what i meant was your life must have been very sheltered if you cannot understand the harm that words can do
language can be dangerous language can humiliate language can kill i agree but until people advocating for and promoting political correctness apply it evenly to every single person regardless of their race sex gender sexuality religion or species then they are part of the problem and equally as guilty of causing real world damage and victims as any s style comic is i would also like to point out noone really cares about speciesism in all of this either the fact that pigs in a blanket fry em like bacon can be celebrated as punching up at institutional power without the faintest willingness to accept the institutionalized power of the individuals chanting it against the individuals who are still enslaved and killed on mass for people to consume their flesh not only shows the extreme hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance of progressive politics it also reveals just how reactionary and privileged it actually is
the historic role of the left was to widen the franchise establish freedoms and improve the living conditions of working people now its about engaging in trivial campus level conversations with itself about what youre permitted to say its a travesty of itself and keir hardie or nye bevan would be appalled and unsurprisingly people have stopped voting for it
doesnt bother me at all its an observation that many people seem to agree with
we slaughtered nazis because they started invading other countries not because we disliked their views
the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing this is a longwinded and not wholly fair way of saying those who disagree are all the above those who agree are ordinary ive long even searching for a definition of ordinarynormal person as far as i can tell it changes from article to article
it is quite hilarious how so many left wing feminists seems to think that muslim women wearing headscarves is somehow a victory for womens rights
actually i see a lot of merit in that suggestion
its also not good for the left in the long run they are so used to shouting people down that have become completely incapable of changing peoples opinions with open debate i was at a festival with some good friends of mine just after the referendum and when i told them i voted to leave all  of them literally bood me in response i decided to play the devils advocate and actually forced them to stand up for their opinion and discredit mine with some pretty loose arguments i might add and they had nothing  minutes after having  people booing in my face i was the one told to stop being confrontational
anjem choudary was convicted of providing material support to a terrorist organisation fair enough really
are you offended
freewheeling completely open transgender rights isnt this what rights should be in the first place
think you need to understand the difference between radical feminists and the third wave feminists
interesting personally i would pay more attention to the intent behind the words used in my case i think it was clear that no harm was meant if id used some sort of derogatory term about black people it would be different my dad was described as a paddy one time on a visit to the uk there was a deliberate intention there to be offensive but i take your point
completely agree
its good you also noticed that the brexit alf garnetts prefer to stay in the uk its not just they got comfy on their sofa and feel such a neutral preference the ones i know are actively xenophobic and disinterested in johnny foreigner any further than his pouring him another drink on his package holiday
im not really clear about this abit seems to lay down two premises one that speech which harms should not be protected and two that microaggressions harm to which the conclusion we are presumably supposed to make must be that microaggressions should in some way be censored i dont see any way that this could be described as a liberal position it is highly restrictive but i sense abi although this basically authoritarian position is the logical conclusion i sense actually shies away from it she isnt actually able to draw it instead we get the sense that microaggressions should not actually banned as such just subject to endless censorious comments i believe in being nice in being polite and im no fan of the likes of mackenzie and hopkins but i also find this level of censoriousness pretty unattractive i suspect as a political position it is also a deadend
please include a warning to those of a sensitive disposition before posting a photo of the hopkins woman in a faux boudicea pose
if you feel some speech should be censored then as far as im concerned you dont stand for free speech and when you wish to explain your justification for your censorship of free speech by starting your article with the headline ive pasted below i know that im going to get a worn out overthetop social justice warrior lecture so i simply stop reading a backlash against politically correct language ignores the deeper oppression that unchecked microaggressions inflict on groups such as women and black people the deeper oppression that unchecked micro aggressions inflict on groups does this cover objective healthy criticism that a particular group muslims for example may not particularly want to hear or is this just a pcgonewild parody id have thought that after both brexit and trump winning as a direct result of the backlash to pc you would have learned to tone it down by now in case you havent noticed pc diatribes arent working anymore you overplayed that hand and now le pen is only one massive bataclantype french terror attack away from winning the french elections isis could very well be the french king maker and if this happens you can kiss the eu as you know it goodbye your overplayed pc hand is now the losing hand in american and european politics pc loses its luster when its getting people killed yet we still get guardian articles like this one you should be giving it a rest by now
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening how much evidence do you need brexit trump
katy hopkins might be a blowhard but repeating the lbc you tube clips of her demolishing london liberals on the question of brexit and immigration keeps me buoyant all day
dmk maybe if youd written in english it would have been easier not for you
generalisations are always foolish
i did think about having themacroaggressor as a profile name but thought vicesignaller might want it
what do you mean if they are free to openly preach death to the west anjem choudary did it for more than a decade and only had his collar felt when he got sloppy and crossed the line between preaching death to the west and actively aiding daesh that rather misses my point he has been arrested and he had to be careful to stay within the law in order not to be he crossed the line only by swearing allegiance to isis you say there is hypocrisy but when did you last see a muslim cleric preaching hate on a street corner and when was the last time you heard of a rightwing extremist actually getting jailed as opposed to something akin to a clip round the ear it doesnt seem to me like theres much disparity the police had their eyes on choudhury for years waiting for him to slip up that seems to me like theyre taking this pretty seriously but your argument seems to be that they should have left him and all the others alone because its only speech why should i be banned from hating an ideology simply because its based on a thousand year old book and was allegedly dictated by angels or gods or a three eyed raven depends if that ideology is a serious threat to the rest of us
never post anything online that you wouldnt dare say to someone in person
white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed is the historicallyoppressed demographic a route to ensure that people who dont seem oppressed in their own lifetimes like middleclass feminists can still claim victimhood status on the basis of their ancestors as a white hetero man can i claim victimhood status if my ancestors were oppressed by the luftwaffe also is that sentence ed above a microaggression if i was being picky it sounds a bit sneery as if white hetero men never have any problems in their lives
there are plenty of people who have venerated milo for saying the unsayable i think its fair to call them supporters some of the more high profile defenders such as breitbart or spiked have been noticeably quiet which i think just shows the rank hypocrisy involved in their previous arguments they supported free speech right up until the time it became unpopular or something they didnt like this is absolutely the time to test how their commitment to freedom of speech as their credibility is at stake on this point
you are a thoughtful gay man  in the gay world does boys always refer to people below the age of consent is it possible for there to be relationships between older gay men and younger ones that are beneficial to the younger man and his introduction to his sexuality if what did for milo he gets to be just milo as his surname is a pain to get right on an ipad was not what he said or meant then is it a good thing that he was done in
beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of overexposed its impossible to underplay the significance of the riot at berkeley ironically the birthplace of the modern free speech movement fms in the us in the mids and hard to identify the supposed threat wake up the regressive lefts antipathy towards free speech this rioting to prevent a lecture as an example of liberal free speech in action is so confused and so destructive the moment youre using violence to prevent someone from speaking youre on the wrong side of the argument
be polite unless theres a compelling reason not to be and all sides of every debate need to have a lot more respect for the principle of charity twitter hate mobs for poor sods wearing tacky shirts are not doing anything but playing into the hands of the political correctness gone mad mob
good article i defend the right of people to say abhorrent things and would protest if that right was truly in jeopardybut that doesnt mean i dont bemoan the meanspiritedness and lack of civility in political commentary today
what happens when you get offended literally what happens the other day i found a blog article titled racism is the only invention white people wont take credit for now as a white person with an interest in history i found the piece to be an illinformed pile of nonsense and yes offensive so what did i do about it nothing i got on with my life because im not a sensitive little butterfly that needs a hug when someone says something nasty about the group i happen to be part of people are going to say things we dont like as long as they dont dictate policy in the uk who cares toughen up and chose a fight that actually matters
i know it sometimes seems disproportionate but in a society recovering from lets be optimists a past where there most definitely was open and unabashed discrimination against black people is it really so difficult to pretend along the idea is to cool the temperature of what recently was a hot war and keep it cooled long enough to chill the tension away i think thats an okay thing to hope for and that we all need to put in a bit of acting dont you i know the whole thing is storm in a teacup territory and i even know you were in the right and the lady was possibly a bit neurotic we do not know and cannot presume to know perhaps she lived decades of her life in a background where the black guy was a term of hate it was how her dad spoke or her uncle or whatever and this has left its mark on her life
my personal line is where free speech turns into hate speech i dont think there is any benefit to society when hate speech is considered free speech this is the definition i would use for hate speech hate speech is a communication that carries no meaning other than the expression of hatred for some group especially in circumstances in which the communication is likely to provoke violence it is an incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race ethnicity national origin gender religion sexual orientation and the like hate speech can be any form of expression regarded as offensive to racial ethnic and religious groups and other discrete minorities or to women
damn i will report for reeducation immediately comrade
definition of harm for the author for those that dont want to click on the link harm is causing physical injure we either have free speech or censorship censorship that is decided by people in power nobody should have the ability to police speech you might say hate speech is bad but who choose what hate speech is for instance i find religion to be superstitious abhorrent and ridiculous so if i were to say the the burka and hijab are just like a christians habit that is a symbol of oppression who says if that is hate speech currently we dont but what if we were under an islamic government
anjem choudary arrested just last year for supporting isis i was refering specifically to those who were threatening rushdiein saying that i bet a few wished they were arrested they would probably be millionaires now
liberalism runs ideas up the flagpole to see if anyone salutes sometimes they do as with the stoning of adulteresses but what you are asking us to do now is to redefine our sense of gender and ironically violate womens real safe spaces i fall into that vast category of people who would quite happily welcome a mature debate about what aspects of traditional islamic practice ought to be rejected and how but find that the whole topic of conversation is dominated by a generalised bigotry that rejects the whole possibility of a benign muslim population this is just air headed drivel and seems to wish islam to be something that it isnt or to behave other than how it has behaved but that isnt the point people have to be free to make the case as they legitimately see it you are confusing ringfencing with trying to set out which extreme views are continuously rejected as unhelpful and uncompromising no im not and you dont get to decide what is extreme on my behalf that is the point
why is the former not ok or is it just you choosing to be offended by it
liberation from europe springs to mind as a non argument
to cut a long story short people who say anything i dont agree with should be silenced one way or the other its all for our collective good you see
yes but first do a selfsanity check before you get offended i get offended by people who pick up on a word i say or an inocuous statement i make try and censor me so we all are offended but the difference is that with me its like water off a ducks back and i have a good laugh and get on with my life but if you want to claim special status to not be offended forget it
how can words be harmful unless you think that the person saying them is in some way better than you remember that whatever is said it is never more than an opinion
facts are a microaggression against oppressed groups
i have a couple of key questions for you abi you would do well to join us belowtheline every couple of weeks another article will be published railing against leftwingers policing language and proclaiming pompously how vital it is that we should be free to offend in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls in that article you linked are you saying once sorting the comments via recommends that all those commenters are juvenile internet trolls evelyn beatrice hall had a neat summary of voltaires core belief system when she gave us this timeless phrase of history i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it do you support such a sentiment
superb post thank you
so extremists in the muslim religion then have a right to ban anything that depicts their mohammed or they find offensive in some way not in my democracy so where does this sort of thing stop as ive said in an earlier post people who strongly support freewheeling completely open transgender rights actively tried to get a radical feminist off the speakers roster impacting her ability to make a livelihood because while she supports human rights for transgendered people she does not believe these human rights extend to teenaged boys using girls shower rooms im a woman who lived in a time when the culture felt it was acceptable to be openly hostile to a woman working outside the home if she had a baby i personally remember the sorrow of the defeated equal rights amendment in the us we didnt ask anyone to stop speaking we asked people to speak up for what we believed was right
wouldnt be difficult to find some of the same arguments have been made in this paper given that the ones that took milo down on this issue are conservatives i think the hypocrisy is really emanating from that side who are unwilling to support him despite having held him up as a brave and fearless defender of free speech and unpopular views
no you are likely to get other people hurt as they run for the exit thats the whole point of the saying
i also think thats a false distinction he just lost support there is no such thing fundamentally as a milo supporter or non supporter just people who support milo at a particular time and who are happily currently dwindling labelling people as racists or transphobic because they said or supported something deemed to be unnaceptable and are therefore themselves unnaceptable is another trick used to close down debate we need to listen and engage with what people say not condemn them for their views
if the teacher is in the staffroom then thats where they are 
scottmoore hi scott well thanks for that please flesh out your assertion and give examples i must admit to having no first hand experience of its early usage i still think its faintly ridiculous to call a chairman a chair i thought we had ditched most of the th century in modern english but wait a moment while i adjust my codpiece
but thats the entire point of my comment and article atl theres a wonderful adaptive stylish grammatical singular pronoun thats been used from shakespeare to coleridge as berry points out thats not mired in toxic power struggles which doesnt require gendered doublethink and the pointless insistence that he really means heshe its called they
wheres the teacherstaffroomwhy waste breath
far more important is the lack of the second person plural in englishi nominate youse 
actress authoress spinster girl bride sister conductress countess mum duchess woman empress mother goddess grandmother heiress heroine hostess wife queen woman mistress murderess niece poetess policewoman princess madam daughter aunt witch waitressoh yes lets be rid of all of our english language you are a woman you can never be a man any more than a man can be a woman stop being silly
yes me too been using it for genderlessness for years and wondering why it felt strangely unofficial to do so
you is the best word here
so some people say using they is incorrect never wouldve thought it
wyh do we need they what is wrong with shit
solve
naturlich
other languages dont have that problem about doctor they have a masculine and feminine for doctor which eliminates doubt english should do more of that
im not saying that he or she is wrong im just saying that its courteous to the author to actually read their article before you tell them you disagree
when harold macmillan said youve never had it so good who was he referring to the cameraman
wholly agreed on the they issue but this rabid thing again christ
wheres the teacher they are in the staffroom beautiful english
just yknow accurate unless you dont know which they are if i was to meet a muse fan i would shake her by the hand
yes since i was a child i can remember always using they for genderless i dont know why this article says it isnt common
i adopted this usage after reading marge piercys woman on the edge of time some  years ago
if you are on fb there is a page called a mighty girl they list lots of books that have female lead characters
me too didnt even realise that anyone objected to it i obviously live a sheltered life
if you are on fb there is a page called a mighty girl they list lots of books that have female lead characters
ive been using they as a singular for years and thought it was common tried she but thats really clumsy and contrived i cant understand why so many seem to object as in frequency not social class
all i know is this when i walk into a local book store or news agency half of the entire sections of books are aimed primarily at women with usually just one side of one shelf stand aimed primarily at men the remaining less than half of shelf space is anyones and everyones territory
tell that to fireman sam
things only the guardian cares about no 
im with musefan this is the idea of someone with too much spare time on their hands
im generally am aware of my language use and the effects it can have so will use a combination of shehes plus they sometimes however at heart i believe in freedom so certainly wouldnt expect other people to do the same
oh the humanity or is that hupersonity
you mean like it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again 
about  years ago in the north west of the uk we were specifically told not to just use he or him because that would be sexist we were also told that he or she is ok as well
are you saying women or men dont have the same opportunities to write books with female protagonists as men women i dont see where the oppression that you suggest comes from
for some these are real problems
why not be more precise and ask her what she wants if i asked my mother what they wanted shed say how should i know youd better ask them
i was in the princess bride think i know more about jokes than you do benmoreassynt thecheesewrangler and the_blind_beggar have already very patiently pointed out the deficiencies viz a viz your skit i know comedy is hard but have the good grace to retire gracefully when youve failed
id have a tough time redressing the balance by myself shall we apply your logic to some other situations irish immigrant in s london its really awful almost all landlords refuse irish tenants i cant find anywhere to livesmart alec so start a property empire and let to irish people then youre free to do so ordinary person who cares about things i think its terrible there are so few women in parliamentsmart alec so start a political party select loads of women candidates and win a load of seats then youre free to do so
its like apostrophes you dont hear them when people speak so why are they required when people write
without reading the article i know this is utter drivel what an obnoxious attitude at least have the consideration to read the authors work before you comment on it or is your uninformed opinion more valuable than theirs
people who publicly current others grammar are incredibly rude and ought to be ashamed of themselves
ah i knew there had to be a reason for it never got curious enough to investigate
so write a book with a female heroine then sorry hero redress the balance youre free to do so
obviously that comment was supposed to be a reply to someone else and makes no sense by itself
then we would need to ask greg how they like to be referred to
it is widely used as a singular that is not in question the question is whether using it in this way constitutes an error or not amusingly you used they as a singular pronoun in a comment you posted the day before yesterday at  which includes the phrase and before anyone thinks theyre clever with my username yes im well aware that muse have done this too

witch ones of those languages do you speak
you were taught they as a singular pronoun where and when not in uk surely honestly interested in your answer
i was once told as a kid that all hurricanes were female because women were so destructive a barbed comment i never questioned because at the time i already sensed some things were easier if you were a boy or maybe it was a bit of a joke a bit like the onewhy are women like hurricanes theyre wet and wild when they come and take your house when they leave
no im sorry but just no i dont understand this need so many of my fellow countrymen have of needing to claim they are being persecuted in someway this is just another example of the extremeness of the persecution complex so many seem to be carrying around with them it makes no sense at all our language allows us to use any number of descriptors to talk about people both in the singular specific context heshe himher and in the plural context theythem how is the use of heshe himher when talking about an individual persecution of everybody or anybody else who is not being spoken about this is a mental illness and i am serious about that i cant understand why anybody who is not being spoken about in the use of heshe himher in a specific context can be so self centered as to object to themself not being included in the discussion we dont need our language adopted to make insecure people feel included in discussions which arent about them we need the insecure people to gain some self esteem and understand they dont need to be part of everything
others recalled reading books as children about experiences they would have liked to have had but couldnt because it was always a he on the adventure legitimizing the singular use of they is a start but it wont solve this problem since my first child was born a few years ago ive been really struck how almost every main character in childrens stories is a boy its not just that the exciting adventurous characters are boys the central character the agent who does things and makes decisions is almost always a boy or a boy animal no matter what the context the exceptions maisie the mouse peppa the pig really stand out because theyre so unusual
ill always remember my french teacher explaining that person personne is feminine in french even if its a testosterone mass of  rugby players its quinze personnes feminine to all you moral linguistic crusaders get over it gender is a facet of language the only sexism if any lies in certain people who speak it
sorry but i cannot accept they as a singular pronoun it looks fine in your examples but in situations like where is your sister they have gone to the shop it just glares out of me i have to reread it because my brain feels like it missed something i understand the need for a gender neutral pronoun but if you want to get me on board youll have to come up with one that doesnt already have an established meaning as a plural pronoun others recalled reading books as children about experiences they would have liked to have had but couldnt because it was always a he on the adventure is this really a problem as a child i read books watched tv shows and films and played video games featuring female protagonists and not even once did i think i wish the character were male so i could empathise with them
i like the ones where the drooling idiot of a husband is putting gravy browning in the washing machine or something while the mother and daughter look at each other knowingly indulging the pathetic crwtiee in their midst theyre just like real life arent they
which is perfectly correct and appropriate but thats not really what this article is about
some people use he some use she get over it
i was always told its whos she the cats mother
hey you dont know that after all cooties are a thing d
the french language has a few gender issues fils son garcon boy and fille girl fille daughter girls obviously dont need extra status as do boys how about this one a man and his son are driving in a car one day when they get into a fatal accident the man is killed instantly the boy is knocked unconscious but he is still alive he is rushed to hospital and will need immediate surgery the doctor enters the emergency room looks at the boy and says i cant operate on this boy he is my sonltigt so the question is how is this possible the answer is simple the doctor is the boys mother this riddle has been told for a long time to illustrate how common gender stereotypes are in our society perhaps the use of language does need to change but they sounds clunky and grammatically incorrect gender stereotypes on the other hand such as some of those mentioned below should be looked at and changed in the dictionary come on guys get with the programme
eitheri speakers of those languages which have no gendered pronouns are significantly less sexist than speakers of gendered languages such as french english or russianorii there is no difference in attitude or behaviour between speakers of gendered and nongendered languages in which case gendering or otherwise of language is irrelevant are hungarians shiningly less sexist than their slovak and romanian neighbours are the speakers of uralian languages such as udmurt in the same language family as finnish a beacon of antisexism compared to surrounding russian speakers has speaking a nongendered language helped the plight of women in turkey somehow i think not this nitpicking and illogical obsession with the finer points of language is typical middleclass arts graduate stuff
wellyes thats just what id say
although its interesting that you can accept you as both singular and plural but are offended by the same deal for they
most of them are but women are joining up nowadays
dont believe everything you read in an efl book learn some linguistics and history of the english language iyouhesheit are singular weyouthey are plural say th and th century prescriptivists who really didnt know what they were doing when making random proclamations
the reason i ask is ive heard people mention no rights many times but noone has ever justified that comment thanks in advance
i remember getting very cross when i was at school  years ago the pronoun he seemed to be used to cover both genders i felt it very sexist so i decided to use they whenever the opportunity arose quite pleased to have been ahead of my time
you did get the point as that is the point its been like that for ages some people still seem to be upset about it though no idea why
so what rights do they not have is this literally about when youre filling in a form and have to select mr mrs miss etc
yeah its hilarious
hooligans and fish and chips nice one
but no one is of unknown gender indulging people who insist upon some kind of nonbinary gender definition is idiotic
but how can you tell in yorkshire that youre referring to the word they and not that pile of straw over there
yes it is as a sinugular its confusingly silly the plural will have to become theys now substitute she for it to help all the insecure women what a load of rubbish
its not its plural iyouhesheit are singular weyouthey are plural
i am lefthanded and i am actively discriminated against every time someone says it s all right or you go right ahead the english language assimilated both notions for right straight amp opposite of left giving it a whiff of universalism of lexical imperialism even while treating the term left as nothing more than a direction with evil connotations to boot has this wrong been corrected no it hasn t and the discrimination keeps on unchecked don t you think labour would have done better if they had not been constantly assimilated to such a prejudiced term for this night s election seriously 
without reading the article i know this is utter drivel they is word used to describe groups not individuals ill stick to he and she thanks which isnt actually sexist at all just yknow accurate
they is plural when applied to more than one person singular when applied to one as in someones got their knickers in a twist
be camp and call everyone she
someone is singular but they is plural
bless
i quite like the tesco ones where the imbecilic father and son run around like headless chickens looking for glutenfree which of course they dont understand while the intheknow mother and the female at the till share pitying glances and do a nice eyeroll at the burden of it all
china has two words for gender differentiation 他 and 她 different characters but the same pronunciation fact for the day
we already have it weve had it for the better part of a millennium already
ok thanks for the exchange
absolutely
the doctor and the three men exchanged words they were reassured after that brief discussion although in your example there really isnt much ambiguity context and convention would dictate that doctors reassure people and not vice versa if you wanted to ensure that the opposite meaning was transmitted youd just use the passive the doctor was reassured by the three men them after the discussion
in irish formal letters start a chara or a chairde meaning friends
there will always be linguistic ambiguity singular they solves more problems than it causes
the chinese have got this covered using the spoken word ta meaning he she and it
sigh you are linguistically unaware and you steal jokes from sasha baron cohencongrats
ponder no more linguistic determinism ie the idea that language dictates reality was discredit eons ago but the guardian has a bit of an obsession with it
wow are people still being so absurdly childish over gendered language time for them to grow up reallyif you want to be concerned about distortion of gender roles take a look at all the anti male anti father propaganda in the media first example which comes to mind is the series of adverts on radio for protecting your home from fire risk a little girl blames the incompetent uncaring and stupid father while praising all the women in the family gender stereotypes like this are extremely damaging to families
no its both
actually the problem with they is it causes us and them attitudes which surely deppens divides when it should be we but this seems somewhat over analysed is the word your looking for people though i dont mind heesh
a truly entertaining piece vive la différence
it all forms part of the same process of eliminating feminine endings which i cant abide either theyll be back as soon as an advantage is seen in using them you might not work in a profession where eggshell walking is part of the daily grind but by god they is useful but aesthetics matters yes i dont disagree but thats part of rhetoric not grammar the usage is not incorrect and may be the most elegant way around a problem in many circs
but aesthetics matters the beauty of a language is important grammar is too they should live in harmony
in the us they was always used as a pronoun i thought this was resolved  years ago
fiddling while rome burns
chimamanda ngozi adichie is a heroine for refusing to apologise to the offenderati she stated her beliefs she is entitled to those beliefs and she didnt back down i wish more people would stand up for their beliefs in the face of the professionally outraged
i feel very little affinity with the internet left i agree and im not really sure why theyre considered the left at all i think identity politics has headed off in its own direction and is now sort of a thing in its own right id consider myself to be left wing and there seems to be very little overlap between my views and those of the sort of people who are sending others abuse on social media about the specific terminology used when discussing feminism i dont really see that theres much of a common goal or agenda at all
the very fact this article has been written is a comment on just how far removed the left have become from reality
yep downright sinister stuff
does the left have a problem with language orthodoxy is a bear catholic does the pope shit in the woods i sort of gave up on all this after the shitstorm that accompanied cumberbatch when he used his moment in the spotlight at an awards ceremony to highlight the dearth of good acting roles for people on noneuropean heritage because he said coloured people rather than people of colour the forces of and i use the phrase advisedly political correctness were all set to lynch the poor fucker for saying exactly the right thing but with the wrong word order pathetic
spot on
but he got mixed up between people of colour and coloured people which for most people who arent speaking french or spanish would usually mean exactly the same thing
i think her ideas are far from flawed the ideas and language are clear but really my position remains i think gender is about what we experience gender is about how the world treats us and i think a lot of the outrage and anger comes from the idea that in order to be inclusive we sometimes have to deny difference i think that because human difference for so long in all its various forms has been the root of so much oppression sometimes theres the impulse to say lets deny the difference as though by wishing away the difference we can then wish away the oppression i think certain factions on the left focus so heavily on language purity and jargon precisely because a lot of their ideas are garbled nonsense stolen from s french postmodernist intellectuals who were trying to pretend they didnt used to be maoists mixed with shallow pop culture references by infantilized social media addicts ps a lot of people are doing very meaningful and important work as well im just trying to be a smart ass above it is an internet comment section after all
thats an interesting thought piece thanks something to consider is the general assumption that so many more or less activist groupings from where many of the terminological shifts derive are automatically on the political left feminist antiracist disability rights antinuclear trades union etc movements are not necessarily on the left at all they may be politically left on some things and politically right on other things at least a part of the problem for the left and a partial cause of the language difficulties is the effort to take forward the diversity of the political and social demands of these very different groups which of course are also internally divided a dominant right wing strategy is to present a unifying vision to minimise the diversity which usually puts the political right on the front foot often the dominant left wing strategy of offering a diversity of visions puts the political left on the back foot in consequence we hear and read a lot more about struggles over concepts and language on the left than on the right
yes but only by about a month or even less i seem to remember and i didnt get work on the comment desk because of the blog but because i won a competition
that is the only other example of cistrans being used in relatively common parlance also cisalpine and transalpine gaul if youre interested in roman history no idea why its been applied to gender and its a bit offensive frankly given that cis means on this side whereas trans means on the other side seems like a fairly straightforward metaphor to me cisgendered means ones own sense of ones gender is on the same side as societys perception of it while transgendered means its not the other logical prefixes would be homo and hetero but they were already taken
or transjordan now simply jordan and the much lesserused cisjordan in english anyway i think it may still be used in some other european languages to refer to the west bank referring to territories either side of the river jordan i also vaguely remember trans and cis bonds from alevel chemistry quite a few years ago
 in using movementspecific jargon the left runs the risk of sending a message that it is not like the very people it is supposed to be fighting for  yup exactly that ive studied literary theory so im not unfamiliar with critical discourse but to be honest a lot of it is bollocks any attempt to build an egalitarian movement needs to engage the masses and we wont do it with nonsensical terminology
its a morally bankrupt failure to recognise that in many important ways the experiences of trans women and cis women do overlap overlapping experiences with the female sex and being of the female sex are two separate things and it isnt as you say all in the way you phrase it
there is no question that leftish circles parallel the antiintellectualism of the right through their policing of language style over substance used as a weapon and not for enlightenment note how such tactics were used against sanders who hardly is a guy who puts his foot in his mouth that often he was practically branded a racist which is about as fake news as anything republicans pump out after democratic language forensics specialists went through his utterances with j edgar hoover zeal and the damages of such practices are manifest note how in my example the language police used their enforcement to undermine the progressive who quite obviously stood more on the side of women and peace around the world than did the candidate whose minions supported the policing efforts hypersensitive word calibration was used to obfuscate rational measurement to tear down a progressive and prop up someone who openly supported racist criminal justice policies wanton violence against people of color abroad decimation of programs keeping the poor at subsistence levels and who took millions from the very people who destroyed the global economy after they destroyed it for speeches in which she said those very people are best suited to take the position of regulators all of this took place in the milieu of language shaming using language as a weapon to police the undesirables instead of a means to foster common understanding while it often is with good intentions on the left the overreliance on symbolism is a cancer that gives rise to public discourse that permits politicians like clinton and trump
in some ways the lefts insistence on using complicated terms to define the world is a reaction to the fact that it is politically marginalised i thought it was more to cover up the fact that its a strange brew of crazy ideas and downright evil ones
you are answering your own question leftists are opposed to the status quo we use words that separate us from ordinary people you are defining yourself as somehow being special and different youre seeking to be marginalised if you dont want to be marginalised you need to find the attributes that you share with other people not the ones that differentiate yourself the more labels you create to make yourself special the more hatred and intolerance you will engender youre working to create this as a progressive liberal gay woman who has mostly lived in a very conservative environment i could easily have become the butt of everyones jokes and had no respect if id followed the kind of student identity politics youre talking about instead i am one of the lads as well as being one of the girls i have parity and more or less true equality use the words that people already understand to communicate with them and dont try to educate them if they havent asked to be educated nobody likes a lecture no matter how much you think its justified but mostly emphasise how you are one of them a human
 similarly cis is a useful shorthand word to name a kind of gender privilege which is barely recognised in mainstream culture as even existing  cis is an ugly word designed to solve a problem that doesnt exist foisted on us without consultation used sometimes to excuse violence i reject it completely
im sorry did i get you wrong arent you one of the vagenda pair and didnt that predate you writing for the g
how is the truth of an opinion determined an opinion is merely a viewpoint not necessarily a statement of fact it may be based on a false premise but thats not what the author wrote and since shes paid as a writer it is fair enough to point out flaws in her writing
i think the most important thing the left can do is to find people that broadly agree with them and then pounce on them when they in in your view slip up with the language they use and act as though the transgressor is no better than a klansman i think when you look at the world out there this is really the battle that needs fighting
that is a complete non sequitur
thats a very good point that hadnt occurred to me
i started writing for the guardian at almost exactly the same time as starting a blog so i dont personally see it that way in fact id say it made certain members of the internet left a bit cross
the left love diversity but not diverse opinions end of discussion really the control of language is how they seek to prevent the expression of diverse opinions the irony is that the blatant attempts to control our language these past  years is turning out to be the architect of their downfall fortunately their inherent ignorance means that they havent spotted it yet this articles goy stable door and bolted written all over it shows over folks
much of left wing terminology and discourse was actually invented by the right thats my theory you see while the left sits around pondering important questions about intersectionality and what letter to next add to lbgqtia the right has sold the local hospital privatised the forest demanded and got the right to read our emails handed control of the local school to a religious nutter and started fracking
dont you know that normal people or cis as they are known in lala land are to be made to feel inferior in the new world order
i find myself getting increasingly irritated that we cannot seem to just have our own opinion and we must change it or be beaten in the press for being a bigot or delete as appropriate ms adiche is entitled to her opinion and does not necessarily need to change it except she has been asked to clarify so many times that it feels like she must change her opinion in order to be accepted its a weird time this i dont really know where it came about why on earth cant we have a solid robust discussion about complex subjects without labelling people as outdated bigoted or flawed without being elitist in anyway i often wonder if we should start teaching the socratic method from a very early age so we can at least engage one another by having some idea of both points of view thereby allowing the cooperating arguer to have whatever opinion they like
um i am not the author of the piece flawed opinion is certainly not a phrase i would use personally
can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion i can understand a flawed argument but what is a flawed opinion
can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion without being given the chance to change that opinion youve got it completely back to front the problem is you and other left wing authoritarians cant accept there are alternative views and are unwilling to change your own youre politically dogmatic
this type of nonsense is exactly why many of us on the left are despairing
yeah why not i moved down to london and the lads on the building site dont look down on me for my accent if anything they seem to like it but the hipster types always turn around and stare at me its weird
it was used to describe the lived experiences of black women but theres another example right there what on earth is the difference between a lived experience and an experience would it was used to describe the experiences of black women mean anything different
george orwell in  wrote the best account of what happens when you allow language to be manipulated by politicos his newspeak and thoughtcrime has been with us for decades when benedict cumberbatch was attacked for using the term coloured for what we are now required to call black people he wasnt using a derogatory term but what had been the polite usage only twenty years ago language should belong to all of us its not the property of any self appointed group
the issue of how the left communicates its politics has plagued the movement for decades which is no doubt part of the reason why the left has failed to gain traction with voters who have got more important things to do than play at word games with a few pedants the other reason being bankruptcy of ideas its not that people outside the political left are too stupid to understand words like intersectionality gee thanks for the vote of confidence in my intelligence being as im not in the political left but i dont need a few spoilt mediocre intellect middle class students and lecturers to patronise me and pat me on the head when i get it right im quite capable of using a dictionary to find out what intersectionality means if i could be arsedits about time the left faced up to its irrelevance and dealt with it instead of creating a whole new vocabulary centred around the cult of victimhood and using it as a stick with which to beat its opponents
the left mustnt get hung up over language orthodoxy we must be welcoming have a chat with the guardian editor and see if she wants to close down the pc and identity politics focused columns i think you may be wasting your time its not nearly pc enough in my view for example its increasingly clear that the t part of the lgbt acronym is not fully inclusive of all the transgender identities that currently exist facebook lists  of them therefore in order to be as inclusive as possible whilst simultaneously recognising transgender diversity and equality in a nonjudgemental way the following identities must be added to the t part of the lgbt acronym failure to do so could be considered as tending towards the transphobic agender androgyne androgynes androgynous asexual bigender fm female to male female to male trans man female to male transgender man female to male transsexual man ftm gender fluid gender neutral gender nonconforming gender questioning gender variant genderqueer hermaphrodite intersex intersex man intersex person intersex woman male to female male to female trans woman male to female transgender woman male to female transsexual woman mtf neither neutrois nonbinary other pangender polygender t man t woman trans trans female trans male trans man trans person transfemale transmale transman transperson transwoman transexual female transexual male transexual man transexual person transexual woman transgender female transgender person transmasculine twospirit twospirit person and by no means forgetting two person
that would be an ecumenical issue
thanks for replying i think you are right it would explain the confusion that the us voting breakdown showing how many women voted trump caused in certain quarters while you are probably right about the pointlessness of debating them some way of disassociating them from the left that needs to and seeks to win elections might need to be found
also gaul fore and aft of the alps as far as the romans were concerned i think
sure its all the shop floor can talk about dont you know
all this and she still didnt explain what intersectionality and cis mean
upon the lattice consciousness climbs and grows it was needed or something like it i know that jargon is a shorthand for an ingroup to save time but beware of being corrupted by wankthink terms that contextualise abstract concepts are useful within ones own creativity but for communication beyond a subspecialty are also definitely wank maybe get outside of the groups some more messandresolution beats conformation we expect a mathematician to relate useful concepts in plain languageshe doesnt try to force bits of obscure theory and proofs on readers persuade dont wave complexlooking tools at me theyre bits of rigidity why communicate with them
why cant she keep her opinion why does she have to change her opinion to make you happy the left love diversity but not diverse opinions
did you miss this bit do we alienate potential converts
i probably agree with you in general but i have a sneaking suspicion that hammond knew it would wind people up trolling if you like
hah read a brexit thread even if you didnt vote for it as i didnt you ought to be troubled by the unremitting vitriolic contempt and prejudicial assumptions thrown there by some pseudoprogressives
its also used in chemistry to describe different isomers an example would be cisbutene and transbutene
so if we look at the rates of violence murder and suicide amongst cis men is that no privilege either
well its certainly something to be discussed at the next meeting between all the lefties
given the democrats and republicans pretrump perhaps were much the same economics wise id agree in order to maintain some sense of difference and give people some reason to vote they each highlighted their identity
or just knows latin
perhaps ms ohagan might like to reflect on the idiocy of the clauseand if even adichie who has done more to popularise feminism than  of women in the public eye can be denounced after airing a flawed opinionbefore she commits her ramblings to print
you honestly expect us to believe that ludicrous claim
black people have it much tougher in western societies than women do therefore all black people are women logic
are you saying there is no better font that could provide an apposite e i would tend not to e bormann hoxha dzherzhinsky or franco in trying to make a point without giving it considerable thought
can we have an article tomorrow about whether bears shit in the woods more worrying than the bizarre contortions of language is the progressives inability to discuss or debate reasonably with anyone outside frankly a very narrow mindset this is not as they say how you make friends and influence people hardly surprising in the absence of any other prey the average shoal of progressives tend to turn on each other at the drop of a hat
in the uk the most right wing democracy on the planet let me guess a british person who understands nothing about politics abroad lets start with the easy one namely trump before going on to the ethnonationalist politics of india
see not difficult but thats the only thing you picked up upon in my post which i think proves my point rather well
i always thought of myself as left wing myself but i notice this myself i have a regional accent but its only really an issue with left wing or liberal people no one elses seems to judge me for it
id say avoid tribal shibboleths but i think ive just failed
ive read the article linked to about intersectionality and it seems to me a term and a concept that is not needed in the social or legal sphere even one whose use should be discouraged if some case of sex discrimination is not valid you cannot then have some concept of sex race discrimination in which the conditions for the sex part will be less strict because of the addition of the race aspect in other words if a court decides that someone wasnt discriminated against on the grounds of sex that person cant then come back to the court with a new accusation saying but i was also discriminated against on the grounds of race so i was in fact discriminated against on the grounds of sex
reading this piece you can almost smell the fear its a courageous article but im afraid it will be for naught no matter how softly she walks the ctrlleft will come after the author for this nothing more dangerous for a cult than doubt and insufficient faith ing lenin and condescendingly classifying adichies opinions as flawed without any reasoning as if it was the most obvious thing in the world will not be enough to appease the mob of the righteous im afraid heretics must be purged they will hate this more than anything the altright has ever put out
corporate identity politics has nothing to do with being left wing i would argue that it is a very deliberate american distraction from genuine left wing politics
the duty of leftists is not to excommunicate these people for being insufficiently woke it is to welcome them to create a movement where they feel included and respected what sorry i am obviously insufficiently woke to understand what is at the bottom of this cultist nonsense i have been leftwing all my life and have never found it necessary to use a word such as nice touch so many more where that came from intersectionality to explain any of my personal ideas or ideology and i dont consider it my duty to make anybody else do so oh hang on this wouldnt be momentums mission to take over all regional lp groups and bring them round to our values would it or maybe its all a spoof
very fine analogy if trans people wish to adopt an identity thats perfectly ok but i have a great issue with being shoved into a box to conform to this political orthodoxy when this was never previously necessary im not sure what common cause cis people actually have which isnt covered by people or men and women im afraid i dont want to be labelled by lazy leftish shorthand
she was accused of failing to listen to the experiences of trans women and of equivocating over the fact that trans women are women which is of course correct in every sense
adichie was actually  spot on in her words frankly many women are beginning to feel threatened at the easy appropriation of their gender by men and yet when they speak up about it they are rounded upon i fully support the right of transsexual peoples to live in peace to be free to be safe and above all exist however its important to recognise them as transsexuals and not to confuse the issues they face in society with the issues that women face in society they both face significantly different but no less serious barriers and hurdles in life yes some may overlap but not enough to homogenise both groups
learn to listen instead of constantly thinking you have to explain something which is anyway only a point of view totally agree with you actual listening seems to be rare these days particularly in online conversation people seem more interested in stating their side
that left is based on identity
clearly not that bothered about language rules either
ancient rome cisalpine gaul and transalpine 
im disappponted that this didnt go into any analysis of the languagepolicing culture of the left when philip hammond used the word hysterical in parliament the other week those on the left including the woman who was the target of the term fell over themselves to paint this as a sexist incident revealing a deep hatred of women bravely redefining the word as it is used into something that a deeper offence could be taken from yes he was being disrespectful to a fellow mp no it doesnt make him a raving misogynist this is one of the deeply unappealing sides to the modern left and a real barrier to growth the slightest step out of line in the most innocent way and youll be excoriated for thoughtcrime sometimes publicly
well the right are aka conservatives for a reason the point is the progressive left are supposed to be better not just differently bad
exactly although i think it is only fair to say altleft or far left
agree with the thrust of this but would go further however useful or appropriate jargon might be and often it does have a function it is still jargon the left needs to choose what it wants to be an ivory tower critical movement pure in theory and with no influence on practise or a movement that effects change if the latter you will find that mr lenin advocated for systematic allround propaganda ie employ whatever means methods forms and words necessary to communicate your message to the widest group possible a relevant example where the left has shot itself in the foot repeatedly in this regard would be the insistence on drawing a distinction between prejudice and structural racism academically this distinction may be useful in practise it often results in lecturing otherwise potentially sympathetic working class white voters that their attempts to articulate their lived experience are invalid on semantic grounds which goes over about as well as youd expect
latin cis this side trans other side thus cisalpine gaul and transalpine gaul
i dont know
perspective is everything indeed it is in the uk the most right wing democracy on the planet oops
forgive me but are you not part of the internet left someone with a blog who then moved into more msm
i think this huge additional pc vocabulary has gone a long way to helping create the impression of a sneering liberal elite these are created by members of a movement and popularised in online communities of supporters of said movement by the time the debate is brought to the public at large the two sides are almost speaking different languages with one side making the other feel stupidracistsexist etc for speaking how they have done their whole life this despite the fact they could be converted or already actually hold similar views albeit expressed in different terms its very offputting i think people need to remember where others are coming from and people especially working class people may not necessarily come equipped with bleedingedge pc vocabulary or for that matter be overly keen to change how they speak which is part of their identity
theres nothing more alienating that what youve written in this piece about the author having a chance to change her opinion without ever bothering to show that opinion to be wrong the assumption that right and wrong are already decided and that no debate is needed is incredibly arrogant and if anything thats the kind of attitude that pushes away all the women and men who can see through such nonsense
left in the uk the most right wing democracy on the planet perspective is everything it seems to be doing ok in scandinavia the social democracies of the eu so despised by the tories and of course the tiger economies of asia and china are thriving
the hard right dont work so hard at excluding the very people that they want votes from or claim to represent
people e churchill so im not sure where you get that idea
there wouldnt be much left if they did that
yes yes all very sensible but this is the left were talking about inane stupid hypocritical and selfindulgent tosh are everyday fare evidence look no further than who they thought and some still think capable of leading the labour party
i actually find it odd that somewhere sometime a left wing activist did chemistry at university
the female body is fundamentally linked to our oppression so biological women need to be able to speak about that experience without constantly being told they are excluding trans women we are raped because we have vaginaswe are ogled and assaulted because we have breastswe are threatened because we are generally physically smallerwe are discriminated against when we become motherswe are demonised for considering or choosing abortion we are subject to fgm we are taught shame because me menstruate similarly the oppression a transgender person suffers with will be different i dont understand how anyone can say otherwise it denies the role of the female body in sexism completely
we dont need to abandon our language because it isnt instantly recognisable to most people we just need to explain it maybe maybe not or maybe you need to listen to the people who dont recognise your words and see it from their perspective perhaps you need to change as much as them they arent ignoring you because you havent explained things well enough thats a highly arrogant position which assumes you know everything and its everyone elses fault for not being as with it as you are learn to listen instead of constantly thinking you have to explain something which is anyway only a point of view
trans women have not grown up with the disadvantages that women have and in that regard their experience is certainly different from that of many women therefore there should be another category of gender suzanne moore is correct in saying they are not women they are trans women totally different from women but certainly not men if society accepts them as trans women not women though then is that ok
what should be paramount when choosing wording is clarity being understood as perfectly clear language becomes policed and words that have very specific definitions are misused clarity of communication declines and the chance of engaging people with differing views diminishes ms hagan says the whole point of the left is to oppose the mainstream and shift society in a new direction if this is the case the primary objective of the language of the left must be to be as accesible as possible it should bias the intent of the language over its accuracy the benedict cumberbatch example is a fine case in point
i actually had to look up what cis meantit seems a bit like when you do maths having to put  in front of positive numbers to show they are positive when positive is the default setting and needs no quantifying
sorry but they do
theres a debate to be had about how we think about and define free speech but as long as kelvin mackenzie and katie hopkins are still getting published in hugely popular national newspapers its largely academic and you as someone with opposing views are published here thats free speech tadaa
there are two words in free speech critics tend to focus on the second one whereas for me the first is the most important its not a licence for hatemongers its a defence of liberty that protects us all as long as youre not inciting violence or inciting or committing a criminal offence you should be free to speak your opinion and others should be free to not listen we have specific laws against harassment and even though i dont agree with all of them against hate speech we have laws against inciting violence or against speech that might directly cause others harm the wellknown fire in a crowded theatre scenario we have mary whitehousestyle controls on social media that allow you to block abusive users and filter particular words using word lists the latter are highly useful for the oversensitive as you can preblock content en masse on the basis of what someone might say block all known expletives and your thoughts on how omg trump iz hilter or on how videogames oppress women will receive only the most glowing fulsome praise you will have created the echo chamber of your dreams you will have successfully turned the internet into your own ultrarefined private dinner party with all the riffraff outside the window these controls legal and technological seem sufficient in my mind to protect even the most fragile of personalities what more do they want ill tell you they want more than to not hear it they want other people to have no space to say it this is where it starts to impinge on the liberties of others and i think thats something we should all guard against im pleased to see that most people in the comments agree the internet belongs to noone lets not allow authoritarians to colonise it for their own private use words can not do harm its physically impossible the harm is all in your mind offence is always taken never given if youre the kind of person who might be psychologically harmed by things strangers type to you on a screen consider a course of therapy or just open a dictionary begin with aardvark then go through and block each word you come across on your social media account dont ask for draconian measures to be taken against the rest of us on the basis that a minority of people on social media cant handle it and dont know how to use the controls properly finally never use the word microaggressions in a solemn manner if you want ordinary people to take what you have to say seriously
research fact checking and sound biting that is never going to catch on
freedom of speech means we should all be thicker skinned if you think black people and women are inferior to white men for example and tell me so then fine go ahead your opinions to me suck therefore i should be allowed to call you a racist and a sexist without you whinging about being me being a snowflake or whatever because by definition thats exactly what you are if you try to intimidate me with threats of violence or blackmail then ill call the police and well have it out in the courts and see how far your threats get you
dismissing the substance because of the source i doubt karl would approve regardless if you think proust and sartre put as much thought into the concept of offensive language in the twentyfirst century as jimmy carr im afraid youll be sorely disappointed these are jimmys stomping grounds after all to your last point as i said offense is subjective subjectively if you call my wife something thoroughly disgusting in public ill be offended and you and i will be having a scrap
i never said ban this filth i never said to ban katie hopkins and milo yiannopoulos i said put counterpressure on their overinflated platforms
my greatest hope for a real politics in both the us and the uk is that a schoolmarm in the making like abi wilkinson becomes completely irrelevant the sensitivity brigade never accomplishes anything
great minds think alike
many girls in the uk study stem subjects though it is often shown that they are more likely to do so when taught separately to boys do you think that maybe when they are separated from boys they are also separated from the bias because for us at the time it was just another school subject to do homework for study for and be tested for if a girl didnt want to be say a civil engineer it was only because she didnt want to go around in construction sites and i know at least two girls who went on to become civil engineers from my graduation class i think it is the image of the engineering subjects too when you say mechanical engineer it invokes an image of greasy industrial machines whereas you produce gummy bears with the exact same method as sand casting
the stigma then attaches itself to the new word so that has to be replaced by another new word and so on yup sellafieldwindscale
i agree with this and thats the point i made what i meant by denying a platform is more about mainstream media theres different platforms with different degrees of visibility i agree some things you cant root out completely they are best kept on a low simmer somewhere out of sight if possible
but theres also a point at which genuine debate gets stifled and we should all be worried about that i agree i especially felt this around the aftermath of the charlie hebdo attack i recall the tyrannical enforcement of the witless je suis charlie slogan and the witchhunt like atmosphere where anybody who did not wish to be charlie was ridiculed and vilified all because one found it slightly mortifying to identify with the hateful work and pointless deaths of talentless hacks as if they were exemplars of crusading heroism
microaggressions where do you even find these words i dont agree with everything in the guardian should i feed microagressed against no freedom of speech does mean freedom to offend it is not a matter of things being obvious the world used to be flat and people with knowledge in the beginning paid a price for offending the flatearthers it was very obvious to the flatearthers that the world was flat at the same time if i say something that offends somebody i respect their freedom to respond and vice versa
so now that youve got that unpleasant bit of attempted offence out of the way id like to ask you a question do you think that everyone should be held to the same standard or do you think that causing offence to some groups is ok
thanks anyway i tried to find it myself but couldnt
eh how am i being nasty im just pointing out that your philosophy could be seen to encourage subservience in the face of oppression
please point to the place on this doll where the speech hurt you
why are you mocking greek names thats just not on
hmm i reckon it pretty much is that simple we have existing laws to prevent incitement of violence and hate speech anything else no matter how unpleasant you just have to ignore the only point of argument i can see is where is the line in the definition of hate speech the guardian writer would like the definition to be tighter thus limiting speech more how is it more complex than this
i appreciate what abi wilkinson is trying to say here but for me it comes back to personal responsibility but not in the way that she would define it i suspect for example if a woman finds that prevailing untruths stereotypes about womens spatial awareness contributes to anxiety about reading maps it is her duty to go and sort out that anxiety by learning how to read them properly and cope with anxiety which we all have to varying degrees it is not up to the world around her to change i say this simply from practicality because you simply cannot control the world around you you cannot control what other people think and say no matter how hard you try but you can learn to let it not effect you this sort of disastrous mindset of control so beloved by progressives and the left historically its what orwell was going on about simply doesnt work because if you repress it on the surface it doesnt make it go away it simply hangs around underneath the surface fuelling a resentment at being controlled arguably what we are seeing in the world around us now is a resentment at  odd years of being told what to think about such things as race and immigration and open borders erupting in a massive swing towards the right but the left simply doesnt get this because they are addicted to control as a mechanism with which to impose their view on the world
i dont know why youre putting inverted commas around the words offended and hurt as if theyre somehow abstract concepts im neither offended nor hurt by your comment and the attitude it implies tbh saddened would be closer to the truth to take a recent example that guy who called diane abbot a fat black piece of pond slime who should be hung from a tree wouldnt you agree that this was both offensive and hurtful people who are emboldened by the antipc attitude so prevalent right now dont seem to realise that in their glee to offend people they undermine peoples sometimes fragile sense of self in the process and if you dont accept that emotionalmental pain is as significant and real as physical pain then i pity you
freedom is an illusion freedom of speech is an illusion within an illusion
this just culled from the ft is relevant to this discussion google has launched an artificial intelligence tool that identifies abusive comments online helping publishers respond to growing pressure to clamp down on hate speech googles freely available software known as perspective is being tested by a range of news organisations including the new york times the guardian and the economist as a way to help simplify the jobs of humans reviewing comments on their stories there is a paywall but you might get through onhttpswwwftcomcontentccefeebdeded
making fun of greek names is ok though
i cant claim to be a neutral voice on this issue your article made that very clear but thanks for at least stating it the truth is you see no problem with political correctness merely because so far it has not transgressed on your beliefs it has not silenced you as it has millions of others when you gain more experience of life you will realise over protecting people protects them not at all from the realities of life the reason its important to stamp out this nonsense in universities is to not raise another snowflake generation reared to believe they have a right not to be offended college should be about exposure to all viewpoints it is only through that you grow as a person the alternative is merely one form of authoritarian ideology or another one make no mistake political correctness as currently practiced and thus rebelled against at the ballot box is indeed a toxic ideology worse as it warps itself in self congratulatory virtuosness always beware the motives of the do gooder who loves to profess their goodness
the concept of an uncle tom yes what has that got to do with my refusal to be upset by and join in with your idiocy and nastiness
if words had only one meaning they wouldnt be words yeah what about aardvark then thats a word and its only got one meaning so far as i know
of course he wouldnt but that doesnt mean you should be prevented from saying it
 finds itself in a country without everyday racism which country would this be then if you mean the uk i really suggest you get out more
my sister presumably of approximately your age doesnt give a damn about or fit any stereotypes shes not great with a map though
im glad at least some people recognise and remember what was going on back then
hate is not only allowed but encouraged by the state towards those it designates as heretics thousands took to social media to make threats of rape and murder against emma west and her children not one case was even investigated shortly afterwards a man who made a sick joke about an african footballer met with the full force of the law and was imprisoned
where do you understand that from from this very website are you genuinely asking or are you being disingenuous
just because you have the right to publish bland articles full of culturally appropriated mill es and virtuesignalling catchphrases like microaggressions does that mean you should just come out and say what it is you really want anybody with a political opinion to the right of ed miliband to never be allowed to vote or speak with you again
are you suggesting that a guardian opinion writer would leave out cogent information to pander to their own agenda i cant believe it
 the writer here i imagine to see themselves as a progressive liberal lefty not an authoritarian while i dont per se disagree being aware im a privileged none oppressed white patriarch im prepared to be a bit kinder these ideas sound like worthy of examination in a more perfect world but we are in a dire straits world equally there should always be times to enjoy a spot of fiddling but its not perhaps while rome burns while they fret about safe spaces from trigger words and their right to no platform the bullies not just stole their dinner money but then used it to buy up the canteen put in a starbucks instead quashed all the tuck shop competition tripled the prices removed their right to school altogether anyway put them on a zero hours contract slinging unregulated bse ridden burgers sold their house from under them to luxury enclave developers and deported the rest of their family and its not even lunchtime yet
can you blame the backlash when one person complains about a t shirt in primark that was not in itself offensive but relating to a tv show is pulled immediately by the company because primark are obviously terrified of the pc keyboard warriors jumping on the bandwagon political correctness has gone mad in this country because some people look for ways to be offended often on behalf on someone else and social media has made it so easy to air your outrage if you still had to find an address buy a stamp and write to a company to display your outrage  would not bother
no galloway isnt a rightwing politician hes just a failed one a conceited narcissist who changes his alliances and opinions as often as his underwearhis desperate attempts to maintain any sort of public profile brought him his final humiliation when his atempts to become mayor of london won him less than two per cent of the voteno doubt he will pop up again from time to time unable to believe that people neither like nor trust himas a matter of interest why do you mention peter tatchell or germaine greer
women tend to cluster around the mean and men tend towards a wider distribution across many different attributes see helena cronins work on gender differences so its not unsurprising that genius is associated with men but then so is stupidity
ah kizbot i think ive mostly disagreed with you on every other topic ive seen but here you are an absolute joy to read well played
whenever i hear beyonce or rihannas voices in a shouting competition or music for who screams the loudest i usually tend to switch stations is that opinion a microagression
but insults are given like any other unwanted horrid gift i am free to refuse to take it and can leave it with the unpleasant person who tried to make it mine wake up
its not just that they have got sick of being told over and over that they are the cause of all ills even if they have a background on no privilege say irish who were faced with signs saying no irish along with others its idiotic if a large proportion of the voting population falls into that grouping then its likely large number will not vote for those you are affiliated with and want to get in to power alienating people is the last thing you want to do as you dont just alienate any of that group but also others that a related to them wives or sisters and friends it is a losing position its fine though if you want to keep some idea of ideological purity and never compromise i would prefer to build bridges and bring people together there have been many downright evil white people through history but there have been many downright evil people of other races also some people are evil colour or sex does not come it to it the use of you in this is not aimed at mr goodtable who has made a good point but is more a general you
stopping you posting on the guardian website is not censorship censorship would be if you were stopped from paying for your own website to air your views the guardian is a private organisation and can host whatever it likes on web space it pays for
i think it was an attempt to compare suicide attempts between sexes rather than those who actually commit suicide for a debatable attempt
if you noplatform someone you are dictating what it is acceptable to say in the venue youve noplatformed them from but they are free to go somewhere else and articulate their views if a students union noplatforms a speaker they are denying students the opportunity to hear a speaker and make up their own mind likewise the students are free to go and hear the speaker elsewhere as i said in the initial post you have the right to free speech you do not have the right to a platform
give it up you have no right not to be offended
stereotype threat a good excuse to give up on things you find difficult
for the same reason the author touches upon but from the other side of the fence
so we should just allow the freedoms that you personally are okay with thats very telling
i really really dont feel harmed by a stereotype that women cant read maps and ive never had any trouble reading maps so is the problem the stereotype or is it that certain women lack confidence and believe it and is this lack of confidence actually down to their individual upbringing obviously aggression directed at individuals is a problem institutional sexism that would stop a woman being employed in a job that required map reading is a problem but theres also a point at which genuine debate gets stifled and we should all be worried about that
all the noise about free speech is essentially a distraction tactic used by those who know that theyre going to say things that people will complain about quite possibly legitimately and prefer not to answer those complaints take things into the abstract realm of free speech and the argument is diverted into should i be banned from saying that rather than actually talking about what was said this can subsequently be done whenever you dont feel like answering a question even if it doesnt really relate its easy to frame someone saying shut up about free speech and answer the question as an enemy of free speech especially when your audience is primed to hoot in agreement whenever its mentioned in western culture free speech is almost a given the state very rarely intervenes in what people say this is not because the state is wonderful it is more that they have created and nurtured a situation where what an individual says rarely matters to them still what this means is that anyone invoking free speech as the reason why they simply must be allowed to speak whenever and wherever they wish without interruption except when interruptions suits them and so on is essentially admitting that the content of their speech doesnt really matter its not surprising that many of those invoking free speech are supporters of farright ideologies which even at the worst of times are a pretty big ask milo gets to say vile things about lesbians because hey if you argue hell just accuse you of being pc and denying him his free speech this is why the farright love talk shows and debate milo has well had a platform to say whatever he likes without interruption he doesnt have to reply or respond or argue with anyone if he doesnt want to but he doesnt want to be uninterrupted he wants to argue far more than he wants to speak he needs the enemy the evil cultural marxists the sjws the feminazis the elitist left etc in order for his opinions to be under threat and thus defensible as free speech you find this psychology at work all over the internet people screech about censorship because they are not permitted to post comments on articles nothing is stopping them posting the exact same content on i dunno their livejournal or whatever something that they broadly own but thats not what they want to do they dont just want to express their opinion they want it to appear attached to someone elses the mistake in a lot of this is in thinking that its a free speech issue when its not in fact we should be skeptical of anyone who invokes free speech in the west because the chances are theyre trying to hide their real intention
freedom of speech is a bullshit concept that further exemplifies western hypocrisy
only the old pale and stale have a problem with this in all seriousness where do you go after microaggressions trump was needed to bring the balance back
we already have to all intents and purposes limited peoples freedom to say things that may hurt others feelings any religion is now off limits for example
so you think we should all just go around calling black men boy do you words have power they can harm and oppress exactly the point the article was making
but insults are given
should be good apparently he was called a racist for passing adverse comments about some of obamas policies you couldnt make it up 
we should be nicer to one another is not the main thrust of the pc folks it is more thou shalt not say this because we have forbidden it
and yet you bought it you were sufficiently intrigued to part with your cash he got what he wanted im sure he could care less what anyone thinks
right to reply do you know what that means pretty sure the right to reply doesnt extend to the related opinions of random internet users there you have illustrated exactly why provocateurs like my are currently inheriting the earth because the guardian closes its comments
so we should limit peoples freedom to say things that might hurt other peoples feelings well when i hear privileged young guardian types trying kindly to restrict everyone elses freedom of speech it has a negative effect on my mental health i demand a ban on this kind of sick microaggression against my mental wellbeing and my freedom
its pretty well established that people who whinge loudest about having their freedom of speech infringed are usually of the one demographic almost comically safe from such censorship generally straight generally comfortable generally white generally male they want and are usually allowed to be as sexist racist homophobic as they like where these giant babies many of them out in force in these comments lose their minds and begin pissing blood is when somebody calls them on their bullshit and points out how silly they and their statements are which is ironic considering these extremely fragile free speech warriors are also likely to be the kind of mouth breather who waffles on about snowflakes and triggering paul watson milo yuntipolollododpouspous richard spencer especially spring to mind
a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps please be a proper journalist when citing scientific studies the link in the above e goes to a daily mail article the actual study that the e and the dm article are referring to is margherita malanchini et al  the genetic and environmental aetiology of spatial mathematics and general anxiety scientific reports  available open access here good journalism would link to the actual study especially since it available openaccess to all readers rather than to the daily mail if you read the actual study you find that the researchers also note immediately after the above e that the higher levels of anxiety reported by females in every domain may partly depend on their greater willingness to disclose their levels of anxiety if compared to males this is consistent with findings showing that females reported higher trait mathematics anxiety however no sex differences were observed when state mathematics anxiety was measured straight after mathematics lessons
things that only we can see
it is called the silence treatment and can be quite disrespectful as wellbut either the case of silence or verbal microagressions it always comes down to education and manners ever fading away in a more egotistical society funny thing is even without banning the speech is being accountable for your words still trully freedom of speech because you can make a case in court for verbal assault over your mental integrity and with the proper witnesses receive compensation in the criminal code but i believe the answer is yes anyway
the reality is anyone that questions any left opinions is labelled as z y or z its also ironic that the so called left are the most violent
well fine call it out but dont be surprised if the offender is offended by labels such as misogynist or racist and as a consequence steps up his game and really starts to lash out to intentionally hurt this time i love this newspaper but the fact that the guardian abused the word misogyny so much in  miraculously stopped anyone else notice that has led to more pain and hurt than we would have had if they just ignored gender issues altogether people just get nasty whenever theyre accused of being a terrible person just for saying something trollish off the cuff
okay bollocks it is very clear that some people set out to offend and succeedit is entirely possible for people to use language to hurt and demean other peopleyou armchair liberals get on my nerves
never heard of the concept of an uncle tom
who are you scared of provoking there is a fundamental problem with society in this sense having to work twice as hard because it may offend and the provocation level of how incensed people may become there are deep flaws with all of this i think that you just have to rest with the fact that people really dont like each other that much and its who you share the world with why even be bothered of thinking about it that much conspiracy theorists would say the world is connected and all events are connected another point of view would be to say it is love that connects people maybe its all bullshit
you dont know what it is like until you tried it i went to germany as a language student while looking for accommodation i phoned a potential landlady who immediately told me lots of reasons why the flat would be inappropriate for me when i mentioned this to the student accommodation officer i was told that i shouldnt have been given that contact number because the lady does not like foreigners i felt incensed me foreign a nice white english ladthat was a one time snub over the phone i hate to imagine what full on racism is like
your strawpeople are on fire the writer asked what personal duty people may have to consider others views and feelings when they speak my deeply conservative grandmother thought that that was a prerequisite for civilized behavior and my experience proves her right just what about courteously phrased factbased communication would censor you
exactly and it probably made more people want to read it anyways so winwin for donny
germain greer is trotting out tired old cliches gee i can only applaud the bravery of your antifeminist sentiments
ah jimmy carr one of the worlds greatest thinkers how times have changed i remember when people ed proust sartre and marxso if i called your wife something thoroughly disgusting in public youd be okay with that dont believe you 
yes he probably did as he would have gone against his employers policy you cant just sack people for no reason you know they actually have to break your rules how do you know the people who called for him to get sacked are silent about those things know every conversation they have campaign they support or blog they post
but noplatforming is not the same as dictating the limits of acceptable speech how is it not if you noplatform someone you are dictating what it is acceptable to say in the venue youve noplatformed them from if a students union noplatforms a speaker they are denying students the opportunity to hear a speaker and make up their own mind and to respond and criticise the point of view articulated
jtstone you are making the mistake of treating skills as if they were binary you got it or you dont that is because skills are binary you do either have them or you do not case in point you can read a map and navigate or you cannot its been scientifically proven that skill diminishes with low expectations which can be conferred by stereotypes it has also been scientifically proven that skills do not progress when you dont put any effort or very little effort whatsoever into acquiring them when youre confident you get good at something far more quickly when you work hard at something this happens too i heard all these facesaving idiotic excuses low expectations confidence etc etc when i was a school teacher they were used to explain how certain groups continually underperformed young underclass white boys for example but they did not underperform because we teachers had low expectations of them and had thus cruelly shattered their confidence they underperformed because they had no work ethic low horizons and an impoverished outlook none of which contained any respect for nor interest in school and learning these facesaving excuses were ridiculous back then and they are equally ridiculous now large numbers of women are completely lost when it comes to navigation and this is not caused by the opinion of others but rather by their simple failure to learn this skill a skill which many women would not see as either necessary nor desirable
offence cannot be given only taken get your head round that and the vast majority of incidents will melt awayexcept that the serial and recreationally offended will then feel obliged to up their game and find even more insignificant ways to be offended
the fact that you want the daily mail banned paints a bleak picture of this country if you or your ilk ever gained power
sociocultural factors such as the gender stereotype surrounding mathematics and more generally stem subjects may contribute to these observed sex differences in anxiety for example women who value mathematics and are acquainted with the social stereotype that women tend not to do as well as men in mathematics tend to be the most sensitive to the pressure of gender stereotype and to feel anxious about mathematics the  there refers to another peer reviews study which states stereotype threat causes similar cognitive impairments that also lead to underperformance in mathematics stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon whereby individuals perform more poorly than their ability dictates on a task when a relevant negative stereotype is made salient in the performance situation steele and aronson  for example women perform worse when the stereotype that women are bad at mathematics is made salient than when it is not african american students perform worse when they believe a test is designed to measure intelligence than when they do not and white men perform worse in a sports contest when they believe the contest is about natural ability as compared to sport intelligence spencer steele and quinn  steel and aronson  it is believed that the poor performance results from concern that if an individual fails then they might be viewed as confirming a negative social stereotype of particular importance to the current paper is the finding that women are quite susceptible to experiencing stereotype threat in situations where they are to perform mathematics for example beilock rydell and mcconnell  tested women on a multistep mathematics problem they had two groups a research in mathematics education  downloaded by university of chicago library at   june  stereotyped group and a control group both groups first did a set of mathematics problems which served as a measure of baseline level of their mathematics ability then the stereotyped group was told that the task was being used to investigate why women do worse than men on mathematics while the control group was told that the researchers were studying problem solving both groups then completed a posttest of mathematics ability in the threatened group ie those told that the study was investigating gender differences in mathematics accuracy dropped  from baseline to posttest whereas the control group actually saw an increase in accuracy likely due to practice indeed stereotype threat can be induced in women taking a mathematics test by simply asking them to identify their gender before the test stricker and ward  danaher and crandall  so the original study speculates because that wasnt what their study was about but there is significant evidence to back up their speculation and indeed the writers that women performance worse in subjects where there is a negative stereotype about women
hi i dont think were particularly disagreeing but one distinctino that i think is missing especially from the article is that between discourse as in commentators journos comics and etc talking about stuff and personal behaviour in public i think that if there is to be any distinction discoursedebate needs to be a lot more determinedly honest and forthright there are norms of courtesy to strangers and behaviour on buses and so on that simply should not apply to being a panellist on question time it is always possible to cause hurt intentionally or not but if for example i was arguing against a religious person i would be more than half aware that the ideas i am defending we are apes god doesnt exist could come across as hurtful yet there would be a kind of dutifulness in pursuing them nonetheless if it was a stranger on a bus and we had accidentally strayed into that area or brexit or trump or global warming then id shut up much sooner
well not really convinced there is a much difference between far left and far right these days
no i meant theyre antifascists thats the name of the movement need to be precise about how they term themselves rather than sweeping it up into the liberal left which theyre not but i agree a balance needs to be found regarding introspection
no a stale pale male
jihadis not hihadis the sun is taking my eyes out at the moment
owen jones is working class the same owen whose parents were high up union workers and university lecturers and was fast tracked as a researcher into labour via his trade union political connections from his parents
katy hopkins is a giant snowflake always offended by someone or something
wtf back at youare you really saying that every nursery rhyme you learned many moons ago is  accurate and does not bear any examination criticism or amendment i would rather live my life with adult reasoned thinking as opposed to your suggestion that use little kids rhymes to dictate our societys values
the gurdian has become a bit of joke but not one of much consequence any more
political correctness and hypocrisy are alive and well in the uk today innocuous remarks can be used to smear and hound people out of their jobs did the nobel laureate sir tim hunt deserve to be fired about an off hand comment that women are more likely to cry in the laboratory hypocrisy because the thought police are more concerned about off the cuff comments than actions ie those who campaigned to get tim hunt sacked for his remark strangely silent on forced abortions in china womens rights in many middle eastern countries and a recent usa presidential candidate who backed her husband lying about sexual relations with a naive intern in the oval office
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed this nonsense again its exactly this demonising of white men that is the problem with the pc intersectionality based movement and is why trump won
even the most carefully phrased legitimate criticism about the lack of freedoms such as lgbt or female rights in some of the more extreme muslim communities causes a wail of islamophobia some crirticism may be a little hard but there are many examples where people are simply criticising these aspects or the funadamentalist hihadis that a few communities generate does raise that supoosed islamophobia
any control on free speech immediately voids it being free speech
if even adichie who has done more to popularise feminism than  of women in the public eye can be denounced after airing a flawed opinion without being given the chance to change that opinion why cant she just keep the opinion shes got why can she only be accepted if she changes it and how can it be a flawed opinion this attitude is another reason many are turned off by socalled leftists
is she right that progressive activists insistence on certain language stifles conversation  ask benedict cumberbatch
well whoever wrote what you read was stupid what on earth are you going on about when you say i want to make a constitutional crisis out of it i merely said you were utterly wrong which you were sometimes the origins of language can unconsciously go back further eg is it just a coincidence that we have bonfires to celebrate an event in english and in japan they traditonally light lanterns to guide their ancestors spirits back out to sea at obon it is a concidence yes how could it possibly be otherwise
kirstenbroomhall  october  am  oh dont mind me i just thought it was an amusing thing to be sat contemplating
fishing operative if you dont mind sounding like a job vacancy ad
i hope so so many of our problems are caused by men with their masculine competitiveness and domineering attitude if we had a female prime minister they would be more liberal caring and inclusive
notproperty  october  am  i dont understand why people object you can be both singular or plural and no one has a problem with that
great no arguing with that though of course some will on a less socialissues related note can we put an end to an historical while were at it unless youre french andor drop the h and lengthen the i inordinately after all we dont say an university
in irish the male word for they séad fell out of use and now all instances of they use the originally feminine siad
my my political correctness did go mad awfully quickly in this thread didnt it
its so distracting though
i hate it when i read letters and articles which refer to an employee as they or their nothing wrong with repeating employee or saying his or her well nothing wrong apart being longwinded repetitive clumsy and above all completely unncessary the english singular genderneutral pronoun is they them their im not sure why its so hard for some people to accept the fact that the pronoun they has two meanings in english singular genderneutral and plural which is always genderneutral in english it really is pretty simple saying he or she or repeating lexical words is a weird stylistic tic that some people like to indulge in from time to time though of course when they stop thinking about how theyre phrasing their speech and just talk naturally they use they just the same as everyone else does but hey if somebody wants his or her speech to sound longwinded and clumsy its not for me to stop him or her from speaking exactly as he or she wishes its entirely up to him or her how he or she speaks to his or her family friends and colleagues
no the tories still use chairman of the conservative party for whoever holds the post
what about the  times as many men as women given free accommodation in the governments prisons why arent equality activists making a fuss about that
no no joke i read it somewhere i dont doubt that youre right though its not the constitutional crisis you seem to want to make it even if there seems to be an assumption that because it comes from greek and that in greek it had no conscious association with the masculine possessive thats the be all and end all sometimes the origins of language can unconsciously go back further eg is it just a coincidence that we have bonfires to celebrate an event in english and in japan they traditonally light lanterns to guide their ancestors spirits back out to sea at obon
using the feminine pronoun as a universal for everybody whatever next arrivederla for now
but what about all the nonwhiney dudes who might want to read what youve written for its content rather than its point scoring
mooneym  october  am  well you wouldnt but there are quite a lot of greek loan words in the english language and history is one of them so you should care about the words we use in englishin greek though just for your general interest historia is a feminine word
well it is part of my job as a production editor to think about these things
the status quo gets along quite nicely without any help from me thats the reason its the status quo it defends itself oh you can push it about a bit for appearances sake but inevitably its futile
why is it to drivel to suppose shed contemplate demanding at least one woman on the archbishop shortlist the e didnt actually refer to women it said harman is even now planning legislation that at least one contender for the next archbishop of canterbury will have to wear a skirt which is an odd choice of words given that bishops of both sexes wear long frocks
surely the office is always the chair and the incumbent in the office is either also the chair chairperson or indeed the chairman or chairwoman in this instance theres no obvious harm in stating the sex of the person holding the office as long as theres no discrimination involved in phrases such as police woman or woman mp and indeed most of the esses manageress in particular which has happily all but disappeared theres obviously a hint that its a novelty or somehow of lesser importance than the male counterpart im not sure that faint sneer is present in chairwoman i may be wrong and as i always mention on these occasions i think theres a reason actress has stuck where manageress and other esses have waned in use manageress tells you nothing additional to manager beyond stating the sex of the incumbent in the office the tasks performed are identical so the assignation is irrelevant but actors and actresses or clumsily female actors perform slightly different tasks insomuch as one tends to play male roles and the other female roles its rare for casting directors or producers to be seeking an actor of indiscriminate gender for a part and where one has to specify actress is simply more concise than female actor of course in many instances when talking about people in this profession theres no need to use actress but theres also no harm in it actress does not imply lesser worth than actor and thats all my opinions
it sounds like a silly comment but ultimately i have to agree at least in part the use of neutral pronouns is way way down the list of priorities in the very real and important struggle for sexual equality and in view of the world situation it is a trivial at best as an avid reader and a male feminist or sympathizersupporter whichever terms is correct i shudder at the thought of commentators officials or zealous crusaders trying to deconstruct my favourite authors and dream up new formal means of underlining ones gender neutrality and antisexist stance and of policing our language use the best response against linguistic sexism is to actually pick up some works by wisława szymborska silvia plath elfriede jelinek the brontes add your female author of choice here after all whats important is to be read not to be discussed as a footnote in a sexism debate those who dont like to read can start working on more important issues such as why women are under such pressure to wear makeup in public andor show their cleavage in public my partner doesnt feel the need to do either and i find that a far more solid feminist statement than her use of pronouns
they do this in germany too although the germans then use the mrs form for every adult woman in english refusing to use ms got rather boring trying to explain that i was not mrs principle that is my mother before i married and we became dogmen
have you read nineteen eightyfour in nineteen eightyfour orwells point was the language was being stripped of its colour in order to suppress the populations emotions by making people talk robotically they would hopefully behave robotically and not yearn for freedom here the analogy would be make people talk in a nonsexist way and people will hopefully behave in a nonsexist way maybe youve got a problem with that but i dont
and with such eloquence
tehillim  october  am  then why even bother coming on here in the first place if youre simply not interested in issues related to english usage david is a really top class writer on the subject and there are many people besides writers interested in what he has to say coz for one thing hes far from both smug or patronising hes entirely earthbound commonsensical
they for a singular is clumsy illogical ungrammatical and rings out as one of the most egregious examples of the illfamed political correctness gone mad i once read somewhere but dont have a link that singular they has been around for many centuries and it was only when grammarians tried to shoehorn english into latin grammar that they decided that singular they had to be wrong but trying to shoehorn english into latin grammar is itself wrong and as for political correctness gone mad the antisexist defence of singular they is often in response to such things as the unpronounceable politically correct construct of she however youre supposed to pronounce she you could just write it that way in the first place so why even write she at all singular they in contrast is wellestablished regardless of what some ignorant grammarians and english teachers might say and works naturally enough to have survived for many centuries without the users having to think about it at all except when ignoramuses come along and try to police our natural and beautiful language ongoing use of singular they is an example of common sense triumphing over clunky efforts to police language on ignorant grounds hooray for singular they
no i think he can call himself whatever he wants i was just correcting your misaprehension i think its revealing that he chose george over gideon but its entirely his choice
whatever you want
postlady if you can have a postman why cant you have a postwomanthe words lady and gentleman are classist survivals from a earlier age
and bullingdon boys why thats not farting about with the letters in their names to make a weak schoolplayground joke there is a clique or coterie of senior tories whove know each other since they were students and the actual accurately spelled name of a club they all belonged to is an obvious and valid label to put on them
mooneym  october  am  hah i know but why people get on one about typos on the tinterwebz ill never know
some traditionalists even said it should be chairman even if she was a woman and they would address such a person as madam chairman
dearie me i suggest you read some derrida
read  if you want to know what kind of people love to regulate language if were talking language the title of orwells book is nineteen eightyfour no matter how many times american publishers keep trying to rename it
yes there is
thats a yes then ref kizbots comment
indeed so much rudeness on cif from supposedly liberal people judge not
ah ok sorry i was wrong so it is clever to snigger and refer to him as gideon
this has never been a problem for me as for as long as i can remember in pretty well all circumstances the genderneutral pronoun has been they it is the most natural way of speaking and causes no problems only stuffy prescriptivists insist on using the clunky he she or he which is archaic sexist and insulting and assumes that male is the default state for human beings like daily mail headlines which start student in drinking scandal if hes male but female student drinks too much if shes female as if female students were rare and exceptional rather than making up the majority of the student population for many years now i know this is addressed in the article but at least if you talk about firemen you have the reasonable excuse that most firefighters are indeed men when you do it with students it strikingly displays inherent sexism in your way of thinking
new liebour youre sure you dont mean zanu liebore the party of harridan harperson i quite agree im more old school when we wanted to knock margaret thatcher or norman tebbit we simply called them margaret sodding thatcher or norman bloody tebbit of course we were talking rather than typing
its interesting to compare the attitudes of englishspeakers with attitudes of speakers of other latin languages on this business of the sexist pronouns in half a lifetime spent among speakers of french spanish and portuguese i dont believe i have ever heard anybody tweaking the pronouns or the gender agreement in their noun phrases in rebellion against this humiliating situation somebody somewhere must have tried it but the matter never really seems to exercise anybody maybe teh fact that every noun in other latin languages has gender means that speakers dont associate grammatical gender with the gender of human beings dunno any native speakers want to comment on this
language tends to evolve to reflect the word as it is not as it was
i find the idea of getting women on company boars quite apt somehow
tvwriter  october  am  sweet i make millions and millions of typos and i never proof for them as cant be arsed its a comment forum i could care less
and nothing to do with the conservatives either
at least in english we dont have genderised plural pronouns as they do in other latin languages most languages have gender not just latin ones old english had the same ones as german sun female moon male house neuter etc but subsequently lost them in a process of pidginization actually i think the very fact that every noun in such languages is gendered sucks out some of the sex implications in practice i dont find it too difficult in german to avoid gender assumptions at worst it is awkward as when you want to refer to your colleagues and have to say kollegen und kolleginnen you have to refer to the group as male in spanish and french group is feminine in german
why should we care what the greeks say
yes utterly wrong or are you making some sort of joke
junglecitizen  october  am  tee hee very well said
it must be going in all eu countries and its more complex when you throw grammatical gender into the mix in german one often stumbles across very clumsy constructions to avoid using the conventional male form i dont think its the right battlefield for gender equality myself especially when i look at the world around me awash with sexist imagery in tv shows pop videos magazines and advertising there are plenty of great authors of both genders who could be picked apart for pc crimes if one had an agenda but ultimately is it importantone could easily counter the example of shakespeares pc use of they with his far more numerous from todays view sexist characterizations of women
gideon is his forename not his middle name he decided there was something wrong with gideon
he was born gideon oliver osborne and changed his first name to george when he was 
they is perfectly acceptable along with themself as a genderneutral reflexive pronoun after a few months of use both sound perfectly fine and neatly resolve the problem of genderspecific pronouns httptinyurlcomngxnlnq
as a person who is conscious of the implicit gender bias in the english language i too understand and sometimes agonise over the clumsiness of hisher she etc however i will not use the singular they or them any time soon because most likely people will mistaken it as a grammatical mistake rather than my conscientious effort to eliminate the gender bias while preserving the flow of a sentence it is ok for a white male native english speaker to do it for everyone else who doesnt fit that description exactly like myself it is just a bit too risky personally when i refer to a nonspecific person i try to restructure the sentence to make it refer to a nonspecific set of people so using they them etc would be perfectly grammatical when there is no choice like i have to refer to suchandsuch chairperson then hisher she clumsy as they are will have to do
i think they is fine but it drives me mad when people use it in cases where the gender of the person is known eg an official form which asked of a grandfather where were they born
someday there will be a collection of posts correcting other peoples grammar which contain their own grammatical errors i think this is the best example ive seen so far
or in this case we were awake all night
i assume kizbot refers to new liebour i also loathe similar juvenile coinages like tony bliar condem callmedave paddy pantsdown gideon never understood why a kid who hates his first name and uses his middle one is to be criticised for it ed millipede etc etc theres a lot of it on cif
like other phrases such libor condem nation etc and bullingdon boys or gideon because obviously having an unusual middle name is hysterically funny and smart satire
fisher we say sailor and not sailorman except for popeye
cant we just do away with all three of mr mrs and ms they serve no useful purpose
it can be relevant for monitoring purposes and to ensure for example that there is no discrimination in pay and conditions
nice piece when i talk though i hear myself using two registers one gender neutral one more traditional in a formal setting id probably say postalworker if someone at home asks who was that at the door i would not say the postal worker but postman or postlady the same would go for police police constable solves the gender problem in formal writing but nobody would say it on the spur of the moment in the street not because its gender neutrality is uncomfortable but because it is too unwieldly back in the early s i remember there was a furious row among torygraph types about saying chair for a chairwoman some traditionalists even said it should be chairman even if she was a woman that debate is dead now i think most people would be happy with chair why because its gender neutral and snappy language is about ease of usage not just appropriateness
if puncturing the smugness of the selfappointed gatekeepers of english helps deter people from reading their ghastly books so much the better for most people other than professional writers worrying about grammatical minutiae is a waste of time
forget this its missing hyphens we should be concerned about
rainbowkittens  october  am  in greek all words are gendered feminine masculine or neutral coffee is male chair is female table is neutral
it would feel strange referring to a spokes rather than a spokesman or spokeswoman you could say speaker if it were an actual fulltime role for a real man or woman but the formulation a spokesman for x said really means were about to e from xs press release which is signed by some bloke weve never heard of
it is only very recently that government documents have adopted madame for all women regardless of age or marital status and thus dropping mademoiselle the message hasnt been heard by everyone
the issue is not whether it is a good thing to foster nonsexist language but how much weight the issue deserves ms was a good innovation for example because it is right to fight the attitude that a woman should be defined primarily according to her relation to some man it is also good to avoid gendered pronouns when talking about a general person so far as this can be done without too much trauma to the quality of the writing there is a subtle spin imparted by a sentence such as a student should submit his work there is no reason in the world not to replace his with their here thereby avoiding the subtle implication that female students are either missing or dont matter the people who say harperson however are protesting i imagine not against the principle of equality between the sexes but against a pedantic and fundamentalist insistence on the letter of that principle in ways which can often work almost directly contrary to its spirit
but the finnish for heshe is hän as in hän on idiootti she is an idiot the ä isnt pronounced as an e its an a as in anne curiously google translate says hen on idiootti gdp is an idiot
it is the plural subject pronoun after all and used with the plural form of the verb it would actually be odd in a situation where no contextual aid was given if a native speaker didnt make this assumption maybe we need to boldly tweak the language even more in the situation you describe it might be clearer to say they was awake all night etc
if im a hen youre a duck if i lay eggs you lay muck
dickthetag  october  am  its a greek word greek might be a loan word in latin
im all for point scoring its like shooting fish in a barrel when it comes to whiney dudes
when i lived with a transgender friend we used to say shes a girl y or shes a girl x to say if someone was trans
what would be wildly implausible is that shed ever question why there are more career women than career men  i expect shes questioned it for about a second and reached the same conclusion as me despite  years of allmale short lists and despite men hobbling their competition women are winning the race because they have higher iqs are harderworking more determined more balanced have more to lose if they dont
hammers  october  am  why would i care how the spanish speak
see meaning no if you meant the first in a list of  you couldnt use former instead of first the same applies to latter and last
obviously wherever i read that history was his story was wrong then
i agree on is very useful i suppose we have one as an equivalent but it sounds so posh
its the classic right wing confusion between being made to feel mildly guilty for doing something by a writer in a liberal newspaper and being ordered to stop doing something by an authoritarian state under threat of death apparently the difference is really hard to understand for some people
indeed in an ideal world wed have the same word for he and she and mr and mrsmissms gender should never be required on any documents other than medical records as its simply not relevant
at least in english we dont have genderised plural pronouns as they do in other latin languages how humiliating that in group containing  women and  male animal you have to refer to the group as male in spanish and french
i know what you mean but i think the problem with they is that it is associated with adults we usually know the sex of individual children we are talking about and has a formal register which is not really fitting for childrenin most latin languages they dont have this problem though as they can omit the pronoun
whys it never hisbacious border why arent mexican women herpanic sheesh
ive been using they and their for about  years in formal writing only ever had one comment about it
the alternative is to generically use the feminine pronoun that winds quite a few whiney dudes up the alternative to the perfectly simple they it depends if you want to use language for clear communication or as some sort whiney pointscoring exercise bet youre one of those who used to write herstory for history in the olden days
the french system is better
no doubt you like talking through the chair a beautiful image as well other languages eg spanish seem to use generic he without causing any offence do they not
im going to start using sic thats brilliant
it depends on the context i think usually when the term female mp is used it is to make a point about representation so it is relevant male nurse is utterly unnecessary as is woman police officer particularly as these were actual job titles which have now thankfully been changed im an engineering manager the only female of ten engineering managers in my company id be pretty pissed off if my job title was changed to woman engineering manager because it would suggest that my job was in some way different so yes it does matter
its existed since english existed chaucer uses it
it always impresses me when people who benefit from the status quo defend it

enidblytonprodigy  october  am  dont know why you mind about history its a greek word and has nothing to do with gendered language
sheesh
mothers and fathers will shortly be replaced by parental units thank you dan ackroyd
from star trek hello ugly bags of mostly water
perhaps you ought to go and meet him in person
ill kick yer teeth in ooooh mindless violencehow guardian
i hate guys im aware im in the minority but im no stranger to that feeling
understand that that there is some language words etc that will cause offence or exclusion but thisreally the only thing i can say is frankly my dear david morrison i couldnt give a dam this sort of utter bs does nothing to build equality but it does sow the seed of alienation
guys has been a familiarcollective term for decades it indicates a group with a certain level of camaraderie real or implied acquaintances if not exactly friends if people object to having that term used about them they are wishing to stand outside that group let em at least then you know where they stand but just because someone objects to something that doesnt make them right about it
its not the genderism i object to its the cheery inane millennialism millennialism when i was growing up in the s guys was already a gender neutral term that was frequently used
alright guy hows its going i still have all my teeth but a certain internet hardman seems to have lost any credibility
i well remember when people still got all hot and bothered about suggesting ms as the female equivalent of mr since when its become a nonissue and many other terms in common use in the s and s are rightly no longer acceptable language evolves as social mores change as for hi guys like any other colloquialism its about register and context socialising among friends ok professional setting not so
exactly power and privilege are a bit more complex than sjws thinka black kid at eton or any feepaying school has far more power and privilege than a white working class kid attending his local needs improvement comprehensiveif anything has an impact on power and privilege these days its class not race
average joes careful i definitely heard the sound of outrage detection antennas swiveling in your direction
i would pay to watch that
try calling me guy and ill kick yer teeth in even if it happens to be the correct gender
morrison says but its not what you intend its how youre listened to couldnt disagree more
stop erasing the opinions of other women who dont have the same chip on shoulder that you do
mother and toddler group staggering just staggering that one
barry graham mabel
as it appens howzabout guys and gals folks
flower great i think ill steal your idea you may have started something there
you seem to be easily irked
guys has become gender neutral over time as a woman a feminist and a linguist i agree it is much more irksome and seems much more common in australia for women to be referred to as girls
i greet all my friends male female trans with sup bitches as its both offensive and inclusive everyones happy that way as even the complainers get something to complain about no need to thank me
thats actually rather appalling i would have complained and youd have plenty of evidence to show that guys is indeed gender neutral whoever marked you down was a humourless twat
have we exhausted this subject now swear words have begun to invade the comments could we discuss the ubiquitous use of the word  mate instead that always makes me grind my teeth
hi rotting bags of flesh and bones hello talking pieces of furniture there are some nonsexist ways of addressing coworkers
ban bossy fuck my life
the thing is words and their meaning can change over time its really not something any one champion of pc speak can dictate its an organic fluid thing and as such is beyond their control
can you think of a female term which has become gender neutral over time
boo
little bit ironic that youre so keen on emphasising how language ought to be gender neutral yet it doesnt seem to have occurred to you at all to look a little more closely at mother and toddler group
oh come on guys stop talking out of your arses
i grew up next to a dairy farm were the herd were affectionately refered to as the girls or the ladies but never the women the bulls were refered to as the old or young gentlemen the farmer used to call to his workers as chaps and chapesses thank god that was nearly  years ago because he would be lucky to get away with such language these days
check your privilege anybody who has got a second in their life to worry about this sort of bullshit has got privilege oozing out of every orifice i wonder where it ranks on the list of grievances on the agenda of millions of low paid working class women on zero hour contracts somewhere between sexual discrimination and disparity in pay because of time spent off having children ill wager
oh to be alive in such an age
how many guys who think the term guy is non gender specific have slept with another guy
how dare you use people its extremely offensive beginning as it does with pe we all know you mean penis and preceding it with come on is quite beyond the pale your raging subconscious phallocentric femhatred is blindingly obvious for all those who care to notice it wibble
its not the genderism i object to its the cheery inane millennialismenters restauranthi guys fuck off
if were going to stop using guys then we should also stop using mate i think there are far more important gender equality issues to focus on such as pay inequality too true but i might add why choose to be concerned about the word guys when women in australia are all too often referred to as girls
so youre suggesting they should be reasonable and apply common sense i think you could be waiting some time
to you perhaps but you dont speak for everyone
if you get offended by words i feel sorry for you
this
i really think youre in the minority here just accept it and move on its really really not that important
honestly who really gives a fuck theres a natural limit to empathy and understanding and when you get to the point where youre probably alienating lots of men who have always been  supportive of womens struggle for equality its maybe time to give your head a bit of a wobble
i have never heard anyone use it in the uk other than in a sarcastic or jokey fashion
if its acceptable to call a mixed group of people guys is it also acceptable to call a mixed group girls ive never heard that done and i think most men of my acquaintance would be surprised thats because in our society male is considered the norm the socially acceptable way to be so its flattering for women to be counted among the guys but not so much for men to be one of the girlswords are important they are the tools we think with as well as the way we communicate ideas the suggestion to consider the words we use in the office was to encourage people to speak and act inclusively how on earth can that be foolish or offensive
this whole guys debate is a perfect example of the pendulum swinging too far in the other direction if you want to give people ammunition to completely dismiss the discussion about the appropriate use of language in certain settings well you just armed them to the teeth have a nice weekend everyone 
thats more like it
but then i did what all white men should do regularly i checked my privilege i asked feminists and linguists all women what they really think their responses may surprise you you social justice warrior do you check it from within your safe space and hows the white privilege of the white immigrants in the calais jungle going
i get the impression its not patronising for americans but for english it has connotations if simple folk like my pet hate mum and dad investors which sets my teeth on edge
oh no its not
i have found that the biggest culprits of using the word guys have been female i really dont like the word at all never use it and think it patronizing
im more concerned that fathers are excluded
hi dudes we all understand what the speaker intends when with false irony heshe uses a convenient gender neutral expression which masks an ocean of social anxiety to avoid offence and that it is a timorous way of saying i dont know who the h you are but lets be friends but please dont call me babe no matter what sex you are that is the name of the sweetest little piglet in a charming film
i dread to think what sort of a world people who subscribe to that sort of bollocks would create
hello did you have a view on this article or are you just here to make friends 
casual you think this is casual its overt outrageous misogyny and needs to be called out as such damn it
oh ffs hes entitled to his opinion stop trying to shut him down
would wankers be acceptable for the group who objected
but then i did what all white men should do regularly i checked my privilege presumably as a white man you checked your privilege because you wanted to and not because of the kind of hypervigilance that grips individuals once they become aware that even the most banal utterance has the power to offend somebody somewhere so long as we lurch ever closer to the kind of world envisaged by the organisations like the australian diversity council
agree with most of what you say pitfitter but have to say that sometimes insulting behaviour is the only way to speak out against some fuckwits not that they stop being fuckwitted but they should be told and therefore cause them to reflect hmm am i a fuckwit 
ive never heard two gay men greet each other in this waywalking stereotypes maybe but not your average joes
are toddlers exclusively female now
this whole idea of banning words is straight out of orwells  for every one person that finds a certain word offensive there will be other people who use it happily perhaps the best approach is for us to all keep our cool a little more and not automatically reach for the jar of outrage every time someone calls us something we dont like
ok so if you called a woman a man do you think it would be more or less demeaning than a man jokingly calling his friends ladies why do you think when you call a woman a man its demeaning we men less equal
but then i did what all white men should do regularly i checked my privilege ugh i rolled my eyes so hard when i read this i thought id done irreparable ocular damageidentitysocialjusticewarrior nonsense at its very finest
 you mean i address the students my girlsonly classes as well as in mixedsex classes as guys because i want to erase them really are you sure
tried this with my boss stanglers got sacked
i dont think it ever had any real meaning
or warspitegod bless you guv youre a real gent tugs fucking forelock
but they arent being excluded whether you like it or not its an inclusive gender neutral term in 
lol this is stupid i notice there isnt a suggestion as to what would be more appropriate way to causally address a group methinks these people are in danger of disappearing up their own clacker
hello everyone
when i was doing my pgce years ago i got marked down on one of my teaching observations for addressing the class as guys as its apparently not gender neutral which hadnt even occurred to me im female my female friends and i use it all the time as well as dude so now i just call everyone flower the bloke in the coop loves it he giggles and blushes every time he sees me
guys sets my teeth on edge not particularily because im a woman though it does sound a bit silly for females or a mixed group i prefer people which includes everyone and doesnt have that american college student feel the actoractress thing is irritating why should the female title be considered to be demeaning we are women were just as good as men we shouldnt have to be labelled as sortofmen to have our work taken seriously
guys mixed groups of friends peers colleagues children they gender pay inequality is an issuenot an issue gt guys theyguys has become gender neutral over time
being referred to as guys especially by service professionals you all right there guys is deeply irksome
no not just australia britain too we both mainly speak the same language
i cant believe women would worry their pretty little heads about it
would you prefer guys and gals
hiprof mr morrison has come out very strongly against sexism and sexual abuse in the australian armed forces the man actually has the title chief of army he was applauded for his statement about no more toleration of sexual misconduct verbal or physical in australias defence forces after many instances were highlighted and prosecuted respect due to him but my humble personal opinion here is that using guys is not disrespectful or to be condemned the english language is i was told at school many years ago dynamic in that it could and would always change as time went by no one can doubt the influence of americanisms in everyday life nowadays guys has become normal to a gender mixed crowd in australia also ladies to a lesser extent to a mostly male crowd in a pub or club mr morrison is perhaps wrong to highlight this but the man has good intentions and as i say my respect
father ted the way im feeling i could convert guys
why is it patronising isnt it just twee and warm
i always address my plants by their names
come on play the game try to feel a bit conflicted about it
guys is just the way women continue to be erased from everything just like they always have been except now we have to be told its fine by men because it works for men being called ladies is considered by men as derogatory and a joke and still you all dont see it
i grew up in canada in the s and all the kids said you guys but nobody said that in england at the time the phrase is just an americanisation like kids really
is that a shoulder under your chip
the word guy for me is a completely gender neutral word in fact i often use guy to talk about objects plants or animals
yet another man telling women to accept being excluded even as a form of address how refreshing
lot of internal defence stuff really does sort of assume the readers are males happens in a lot of sectors ive seen lots of official documents with he is for he and she at the beginning so they can go on using he the whole time
so casual sexism is ok because youre a woman equality is going so well isnt it
unless you are a woman but please do continue to tell us how we should feel about things
oh do tell because being a female veteran i am totally disregarded by every mixed gender military group i have ever been in love how men get to tell women how fine it is
hey gurl hey a cheeky subversion of gender norms for many myself included its a way to counter the narrowmindedness delusion and hypocrisy of gay men who insist only straight acting men are appealing pigeonholing themselves as masc for masc stigmatising femininity as undesirable all while secretly twerking to your disco needs you i see
when the lizards from betelgeuse take over in their spaceships the appropriate collective noun will be dinner
no its only patronising if its meant to be patronising and it probably isnt
very good comment this causality reversal is ubiquitous in these discussions for example it is assumed that gender stereotypes are always arbitrary and that society perpetrates them for often obscure reasons the possibility that stereotypes exist because societies observed them to be true on average since time immemorial is dismissed out of hand
is physical harm worse than psychological harm many would disagree having been on the receiving end of a good kicking when i was mugged id rather the gang that did it had called me names
i would assume from your comments your demographic is not that of a minority profile
look its simple we need to differentiate between things that are real issues and things that arent things that are real issues include fgm abortion rights black kids getting shot in the us gay marriage transgender kids being able to use the bathroom they feel comfortable in
all this political correctness nonsense led directly to things like trump and brexit which bits of it how does telling someone not to tell a racist joke lead to brexit how does saying that the glass ceiling still exists lead to trump please give us examples of how political correctness led directly to trump and brexit
true i noticed that too
well thats told katie and germaine hasnt it well done you shot them both right down
theres a difference between challenging something and censoring it
the backlash against political correctness is ironic given that it often shrouds itself in the language of freedom of speech but actual seeks to curtail it its based around i dont like people thinking that im a racist or calling me a racist so they should stop doing it so really it seeks to control not just speech but also thought political correctness isnt about shouting racist at people anyway quite the opposite as i see it its about respecting the views of others and essentially practising manners hardly a sinister danger to society
offence is subjective what offends me may not be offensive to someone else thats why you cannot regulate it if i am not allowed to express myself or use certain words because someone else doesnt like it thats oppression thats infringing on my rights in favour of someone elses feelings thats no longer equality that person has a power over me that is subjective they decide what offends them for example using black to describe someone with darker skin was offensive a few years ago it was acceptable to say coloured now coloured is considered hate speech regardless of the speakers intent i refer to cumberbatch and being offensive isnt always bad dont you think the general populous thought suffergetes were offensive at the time point is yes there will be a minority of people who are out to hurt or are careless of their audience but the alternative is far worse
it seems the delivery system of choice for the vanguard of the rightwing is to choose a spokesperson that the politically correct would have a moral problem attacking by choosing women gays or black people to front their passiveagressive campaign of regressive speech they have found a weakness in the liberal lefts ability to strike backunfortunately the liberalleft is not a single united body and on occasion someone breaks ranks to attack the rights mouthpiece where it hurts the right wing react to that by standing up and screaming hypocrisy which of course is highly hypocritical but they cant see it one notable point is the scarcity of potential spokespeople on the right there simply arent very many of these people from the nonhetero white male subset so if their limited number can be neutralised the liberalleft can resume its traditional attack one of the ways forward for the liberalleft is to train up a special group of debate kamikaze to attack and absolutely destroy the rights femalgayblack spokesperson but by doing so rule themselves out of any further engagement on the debating field or to use satire and comedy to undermine them the latter is being used very effectively in the us and its quite obvious how even the white house spokesperson sean spicer has been spooked by how effective it isits a fight the right wing will never win because the dominance of the heterosexualwhite male group in society is limited by its declining number urbanisation creates the population density which means people to have interact with people they would otherwise not include in their circle this in turn creates a familiarity with diverse groups of people which makes unpc comments unacceptable to an increasingly large number in society unless the heterosexualwhite males can turn the tide against urbanisation their campaign of insulting you your friends and relatives is doomed
well exactly people often people youd be forgiven for assuming are vaguely intelligent are simply incapable of grasping the difference between moral and legal statements
unless you are slagging off white people esp men
walter provided the obvious caveats i think youre going to struggle on this thread patrick no offense
i dont really understand what the reference to darwin is supposed to mean but it is possible to be white and male and to be concerned by the erosion of free speech for reasons which arent entirely selfish it is after all a key principle underpinning all our other hard won freedoms
can you tell me what you think is common sense it really would be interesting to know your definition
yes indeed the whole premise of newspeak in  was that by making certain ideas unsayable you make them unthinkable whereas in reality all ideas remain thinkable whatever the words available which is why we go through this euphemism treadmill where a word that carries a stigma is changed but the stigma then attaches itself to the new word so that has to be replaced by another new word and so on
especially at universities sad to say
calling people out on their racistsexisthomophobic views isnt authoritarian or fascist or dictatorial or any other insane paradoxical tag you want to label liberals with its the consequence you inevitably face for saying vicious and cruel things to other people usually minority groups who least able to defend themselves or most likely to suffer as a result what you really want is to say horrible things to people without fear of retribution or retort how authoritarian is that
it became unworkable because people do not take responsibility for the things they say
then i have achieved my aim which is to try to discover what is offensive
the scientists found that women are more prone to such anxiety but the leap to this is because of jokes about mapreading is unsupported by any evidence except the very sentence you ed states that this is what the scientists found therefore they must have had evidence for such a conclusion after all thats how science works
i understand that in britain there is the prejudice that girls cant do stem subjects where do you understand that from
that is a good point i will admit and yes i agree humour is always the best tactic
but andy what if the writer is extremely widely read and is therefore probably influencing the ideas of a huge proportion of the population you feel no need to fight disinformation im a feminist and im a feminist because there are widely accepted erroneous ideas about what women and men cancant and shouldshouldnt do when the misconceptions are held as truths by a large chunk of society it ceases to be just talk and begins to negatively impact your life
what irritates me about political correctness in the use of language is the fact that there is no longer any point of reference for the use of language what i learned at school and in growing up suddenly becomes unacceptable to use and i dont know why nor do i know who decides this nor have any say in the matter and next week another word will be taboo for reasons i know not
surely it would be better to stop making jokes about women altogether then they wouldnt get anxious at all 
were basically talking about online comments here right how about not reading them if they offend for example if i were jessica valenti i simply wouldnt read comments on twitter i would restrict reading comments from those i trust also if i did come across something illegal id pass it to the police
hear hear why do they do it thats politics i guess its not about the pursuit of truth but the pursuit of power
it assumes there is a group view which is hardly ever true even in groups
the very same have an uppy
the argument of the author is fundamentally wrong and very dangerous anybody can claim to be offended by anything people of religious faith commonly claim serious offence at the expression of any views that question the basis of their faith andor its prescriptions since all religions involve beliefs that are incompatible with those of other religions criminalising the causing of offence amounts to the imposition of a general wide ranging blasphemy law for example within the secular sphere it is not homophobic to oppose gay marriage simply a difference of view similarly it is not islamophobic to oppose the establishment of sharia courts or the wearing of full veils in public buildings the way forward should be clear aggression assaults and threats are illegal as is discrimination on religious or racial grounds our laws have already overstepped these limits with hate crimes being dangerously poorly defined
yiannopoulos wasnt thrown off twitter for being supposedly racist he was banned for inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others i dont think it would be much of a defence to argue its okay that targeted abuse i engaged in wasnt racist although i have to say a cursory googling shows that at least some of it clearly was httpstwittercomlesdogggstatusphoto
its not people looking for an opportunity to be affronted who are the problem its the people looking for the opportunity to affront
i think it would be better for society if instead of insisting people get thicker skins we insisted they get better arguments
because they understand what is at stake
youre missing my point to say something is harmful is not a de facto call to ban it it can lead to it clearly but is not in itself that call and one can say something is harmful without arguing that it be banned to insist otherwise is to essentially write off all such arguments because they threaten free speech regardless of whether thats true which in itself is a means of restricting debate or being unwilling to engage in it
ironically the advert which popularised the phrase simples was the subject of numerous complaints about racism
really whats your evidence for making this claim has this always been true of the right indeed what right are you referring to what conservatives are you referring to do all progressives blindly follow all new schools of thought about future society your post only raises more questions in those of us engaged in education
a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps this is a distortion the scientists found that women are more prone to such anxiety but the leap to this is because of jokes about mapreading is unsupported by any evidence for all we know the jokes came about because the anxiety already exists also shame on you for linking to a daily mail article about the study rather than to the study itself especially as the mail article does not link to the study either
i wish it fucking was id do a better job than the guardian thats for sure
since its the opponents of political correctness who voted for trump and brexit your point contains a fatal flaw
completely untrue i am i suppose a liberal since my positions btl here are generally in opposition to the right wing trolls who throw around phrases like identity politics snowflakes and claim that their antiimmigrant fervour is tinged by respect for the law rather than by racismhowever i am a free speech absolutist and this is traditionally a liberal value i firmly believe that one does not have the right to not be offended and that the correct response to language one finds abhorrent is to expose its failures not to censor it the world is full of stupid hateful people and simply shutting them up wont change that fact better we give them the rope to hang themselves like that idiot milo whos been all over the news of late
you must respect my right not to hear it
partly this is a problem of definition political correctness is used often but i have not seen it defined i use it to mean that somebody is believing saying or asserting something not because they believe it to be correct but rather because they wish to please a particular social group and therefore advantage themselves politically so for instance it might be politically correct to highlight the under or over representation of particular groups in some desirable occupations conversely it would be politically incorrect of highlight the over or under representation of other groups in some desirable occupations the choice of which assertions to make between the two groups is on the basis of how politically powerful they are ie to what extent the groups are able to make problems for the person making the assertion i am aware that the term political correctness is not used in the above sense by either its proponents or its opponents however i have never seen this clearly defined and i suspect this is a deliberate or unconcsious decision by the various parties in order to muddy the waters promote their agendas and avoid clarity and scrutiny of what they are actually asserting promoting or proposing the term microaggression is more recent and i also do not know of a clear definition looking at the two parts aggression is overt often harmful social interaction with the intention of inflicting damage or other unpleasantness upon another individual wikipeadia micro presumably means small compared with other aggressionsmicro aggression therefore is a phrase that appears to impute intention this implication of the phrase would appear to be rude towards the people being accused of microagression using the phrase begs the question of the intentions of the person who has microagressed it also contains a sense of aggressor and victim and therefore justice and retribution this would appear to be a rather loaded term for the behaviours being described is that the intention of this phrase or would a better description be unintentional giving of offence that may elicit a polite response pointing this out or equally no response in order not to embarrass the person who has unintentionally given the offenceif the definition of micro aggression cannot be set as given above perhaps it would be better to coin another term instead one which does not have the connotations of intention accusation and retribution it has occurred to me while writing this however that the purpose of the phrase is introduce another category of social transgression which can then be used to change behaviour this is on a sort of three strikes and your out basis so that people can be forgiven the first transgressions but not after they are have been informed that these are microaggressions or they become well know in society to be microaggressions these are therefore closely related to my definition of political correctness above but who choses which micro aggressions are to be identified and therefore outlawed the problem therefore resolving into a political struggle between completing powerful groups the underlying social or biological reality being moot as between these groups it think this is partly what the article was trying to say and partly what it was demonstrating
you just microoffended me im microoutraged now microshame on you
well as a person of  like many who have welcomed genuine refugees over our life time had to put up with the pc of the bbc especially the today program and others media and political pundits using bias and selective journalism regarding asylum seekers immigrants and the lazy work shy people of this country censoring honest open debate by using the race card the pc see a racist under very bed rather like jh hoover did in the us in the past it has been this attempt to silence those wanting to get to the truth which has frustrated the decent caring people of this country and regarding the immigration issue a form of social engineering which has given the right wing element a foothold so causing social unrest it seems the right and left wing are more caught up with their own particular doctrine rather than the overall good 
most people should however agree that the calling of refugees cockroaches that need stamping out by gunboats as something completely unacceptable if only for the mixed metaphor
or indeed patheticness
they didnt think milo yiannopoulos through now the searchlight is being turned on one of their own george takei who has led the same life and has expressed similar views to milo theyve been sitting on this loose comment until now using a blunderbuss to crack a nut in a greenhouse is sure to see you hit yourself or one of your own in the rear milo deserves to be thrown to the wolves and torn to pieces while george will be vigorously protected by the establishment for reasons
ha ha ha that cuts both ways but of course its always the right wingers who are categorically casting themselves as the victims as usual
what a horrible world that would be people with skin like an elephants trampling over every sensitivity and scruple the tyranny of the offensive
all that political corectness nonsense eh could you tell me exactly which words you wanted to call people and what the penalties would be for doing so its all still legal you know people will just know exactly who you are
thank you for the opportunity to clarify that i consider these attempts to interfere with freedom of speech wrong in principle as well im merely pointing out that they are also in practice counterproductive
not really what the writer here believes is of no consequence to me if she honestly thinks white men have sailed through history on a breeze of happy superiority having never suffered oppression fair enough i disagreethats it we dont all have to think the same or have the same interpretations of history the idea that we do political correctness in other words is what causes trouble
i suspect they didnt moderate you because your post was so long that they were fairly confident few people would read it to the end 
yeh i can see that already some including on the left unfortunately have been using it to criticise gay men i think had he restricted himself to talking about male pupils and female teachers hed probably have been okay
no that is not political correctness that you want it is called basic civility to give you an example if you are a fat or obese person it is unacceptable for me to call you dirty ft or similar and you can demand that i do not that is basic civility contrast that with you claiming that there should be no adverts of fit girls with bikinis because the make you feel bad cause you psychological harm etc or that the idea of fitness is a social construct based on patriarchal motives and that people should resist by being fat or obese and proud of it etc and when somebody objects to you they are just oppressors that do not want the society to change etc that is political correctness the example above is of course contrived but i believe you get my point
the rationale behind opposition to political correctness is that people are abusing the principle to shut down opinions they dont agree with by labelling them racisthomophobicsexist but what if those opinions actually are racisthomophobicsexist
true about the pendulum ids didnt have to set up a new apparatus for his benefit cut programme he inherited one from new labour wca and their then preferred choice labour leadership candidate yvette cooper made wca much tougher under her control
sorry but the berkeley example is a bad one violence actual physical violence was used then to censor free speech people have the right to be offended and i am glad they are but violence to individuals is a slippery slope
speech creates situations in my country turkey there is no prejudice about girls in stem subjects so girls do stem subjects with equal and more success than boys i understand that in britain there is the prejudice that girls cant do stem subjects so girls think they cant do stem subjects and dont do stem subjects likewise misogyny and other forms of regressiveness justifies perceptions and convinces men and women that women are inferior we have to fight politically incorrectness ie regressive behaviour
one compelling reason why the social justice left should rethink their policy of censoriousness is that they are achieving little except empowering those they consider their enemies im really really wary of any argument that says silencing your opponents noplatforming and censorship are wrong because theyre counterproductive this implies that if these thing werent counterproductive if they worked and were effective then it would somehow be ok to emply them no they are wrong on their own terms regardless of whether or not they achieve their goals banning speech or attempting to is wrong whether it works or not it is fascist
a recent study at kings college london found that women are more prone to anxiety around navigation spatial awareness and visualisation because of the pervasive stereotype that women are bad at reading maps do actual women behave like this i thought better of them certainly the ones i know have more important concerns than this
one qualifier and two points first you seem a smart fellow and i agree with most of what you say second you people are muddying the waters of political discourse by defining everything neatly as left or right even when those things have nothing to do with either left or right wing politics and third where the fck are all these farleft or to use the phrase i particularly hate regressive left people who so many of you folks see all over the place who align themselves with islam which is the obvious if unsaid implication in your comment or some other bigoted ideology solely as part of an antiwestern sentiment ive yet to ever meet or talk with one of these people but to read internet comments or listen to pompously selfimportant windbags like bill maher or sam harris it seems like they ought to be everywhere why do you people bring up what must be a fringe of a fringe of a fringe as if they were in any way relevant or significant and why then do you label that as farleft when it has nothing whatsoever to do with ownership of the means of production
and im offended by your derogatory comments about this groups of brave adventurous women who are quite capable of looking after themselves and dont need patronising by you
isnt political correctness based on a false premise that language limits thought no its a pejorative term used to suggest someone is acting in bad faith ie there is one truth and there are those who accept the one truth and those who refuse to endorse it because it might offend a group not because they genuinely disagree as such it denotes an exceedingly solipsistic world view which ironically permits of no legitimate dissent
yes i was going to make the same point on hate speech but id already rambled enough i certainly think it is a subject that should currently be discussed within society as the lines between what is and isnt acceptable seem quite blurred nowadays i think as on this article and as part of wider societal ramblings dave down the pub sounding off irate mail columnists even islamic hate preachers calling for censorship i think the conversation carries on which is a good thing and i actually think its a good thing for the lines to be blurred it means they are being tested all the time which moves society on
your last sentence is part of the problem it seems there is s selfappointed group on the left who get to decide what thoughts or comments are per se bigoted they then use the word bigot to cow people those who they dont agree with into silence and the resentment builds up
why do people spend so much time being offended get a thicker skin simples
ah yes and of course its people like you who decide what is common sense 
i can respect that though i would call it being an asshole to people rather than hate speech the problem comes when trying to put the definition of hate speech into law who gets to decide what is and is not hate speech and how do we determine when the law is broken
if youre asking me personally then my answer is no to all of those questions i do concede though that bigotry isnt a trait unique to the left or right and intransigent attitudes towards anything arent helpful
pompous pillock comments are why i specifically and not in a generalised manner dislike my own kind
its noticeable that some of the biggest advocates of a kind of darwinian level of equality and right to abuse are mostly white males im a white male
i accept that many were looking for an opening to take him down once and for all but it was particularly low to hit him over childhood confessions however problematically they came out a taint of homophobia over this one wasnt it typical at one point in time for homophobes to call gay men paedophiles who had relationships with teenagers
no single droplet causes the flood but throwaway jokes and comments microaggressions in the much derided parlance of social justice activism add up to a climate of hostility that makes life significantly harder for members of targeted groups nothing encapsulates patheticness quite as well as being able to say microaggression without laughing
i dont think this author is claiming its the same as physical violence but that it can have negative effects as for evidence much of that around impact on mental health of gay people minority stress and so on appears reliable i dont think its all pulled out of a hat and i think a more robust response to that research is preferable i do prefer a wider range of opinions but i dont think the backlash against pc is necessarily fundamentally because the ideas are wrong
tim thats the natural reaction of a mature adult but unless you call out these twerps and mock them they will eventually win by changing the overall climate of what can be said and who can speak the one thing they dont like is humour at their expense
but even shouting it down is regarded as censorshipn as in the recent case at berkley with milo whatshisface in addirion to free speech people have a right to be offended by offensive speech
pejorative labels are all part of the rough and tumble of discourse though what if someone is actually being homophobic islamophobic or xenophobic and the label is merited
but completely free speech doesnt exist anywhere never has and possibly never will
the whole rationale behind opposition to political correctness is that people want the right to be offensive and abusive and as racisthomophobicsexist as people used to be no the rationale behind opposition to political correctness is that people are abusing the principle to shut down opinions they dont agree with by labelling them racisthomophobicsexist simple test would you trust a rightwing politician to police a debate and remove opinions they found offensive what happens with contentious issues like abortion where one side says that opposing abortion means you hate women and the other side says that supporting abortion means that you support murder
all this political correctness nonsense led directly to things like trump and brexit now we need to decide how to react do we double down and get even more ridiculous or try and get back to some semblance of common sense
being an adult isnt about addressing incorrect information and bigotry about setting things right its great you dont take offence perfect indication that the generalisation doesnt involve you even minimally but shouldnt you be politely correcting those who get it so wrong
a great cry of freedom
some folk need to toughen up and some folk need to get punched in the face its a compromise of sorts d
the enlightenment was taking place with a background of authoritarianism today it is the liberals who are being authoritarian though of course they are not liberals in the enlightenment sense
free speech is essential to democracy it should not be discarded because of oversensitive people looking for an opportunity to be affronted
in our theoretical world shape debate would it not be mad to only invite people who believe the world is round debate is the key word here otherwise why bother at all and that is the key argument of those who oppose noplatforming
yep i personally will never forget the hate stirred up against poor comet guy by those pc twits
this seems contradictory if youre saying that people are calling it harmful in order to have it banned then absent of any specific call to have it banned the statement that it is harmful is not an inherent or implicit call for having it banned it really isnt difficult if you ultimately want to ban something first get it deemed as an actual form of harm rather than mere offence httpwwwbrockbusucabusinessesisaacsisaacshalloweencostumeprotocol i e at busu it is our priority to maintain a campus climate that prevents costumes reinforcing harmful stereotypes around race gender culture and mental health from entering our venues as i said define something as harmful justify banning it for gods sake open your eyes
i dont tend to read her stuff but kudos to her for doing so have also seen harris monbiot and toynbee do so on occasion and all credit to them for doing so as well
abis points are well made and so reasonable as to be beyond criticism no theyre not they all boil down to having the freedom to offend is not having a duty to offend which is a humdrum observation to say the least her weedy genuflections towards the principles of free speech notwithstanding
the legitimisation of hate should always be challenged in an advanced society like ours hate is an emotion required for the dehumanisation of the other a precursor to violence against the other the stoking of hatred among one group directed at another group is particularly dangerous
brilliantly put
the entire concept of political correctness is bunkthe only thing that matters is that everyone mattersthe essential feature of fascism and the neofascism of hanson dolt bernhardi and the rest of the reactionary right is that to them some people dont matter and they are very happy to exploit similar feelings in society at large for political advantageunderstand this allowing this kind of vilification is a step on a road that leads to a place called auschwitz hitlers nazis of course vilified jews and set out to exterminate them but they also vilified homosexuals pacifists jehovas witnesses and the physically and mentally disabled who were also marked for extermination and in every case it began with verbal vilification
ironically the most politically incorrect person i know is a man with cerebral palsy i do volunteer work with he is casually racist homophobic sexist and makes jokes about dv when i tried to explain that it was inappropriate to talk like that in our group he told me they talk like that at home and he can say what he likes so i just ignore him like every one else but it does remind me of the s growing up before the notion of political correctness when men it was always men would throw around terms like fag and spastic and boong in any conversation regardless of who was present make sexist jokes and jokethreaten to hit their wives on occasion in the case of the guy with cp i work with i know he lacks the intellectual skills to distinguish between a private and public conversation i wonder what other peoples excuse is though
and if the two were connected might you give a rats arse then
i question criticise and mock religion including islam very frequently noone has told me im not allowed to do so there seem to be a lot people convinced that this is somehow prohibited but i see little evidence for it
they only talk about the convenient stuff
nothing to do with disabilities people are sick and tired of not being able to question criticise and yes mock backwards religious ideaologies just like christianity is openly scrutinized mocked in the mainstream these days as it should be so should other religions be open to deep scrutiny and ridicule for what they are
as a dual disabled person i couldnt give a rats arse about retard or spastic or loony what im concerned about is the low number of us in the workforce
you failed to address why penny wong voted against ssm when she is a lesbian are you suggesting it was not politically motive or just that she was a hypocrite that is why you avoided the answer as all good politically correct people do my answer was prompted because of your original post which was out of order i dont care about c you also avoided mentioning the case where the woman did not remove her burqa or stand to give evidence thank you you have proved my point about pc
doubling down i see
why not islam purports to be a sociallegal structure not just a religion there is no separation of church and state
like i said were all hypocrites i was refering to the nonroyal you i should start using the word one more im perfectly ok with calling people dickheads its different because im not focusing on any particular racial or ethnic or religious or gender aspect to prejudge people plus im not fanning any flames i may or may not be focusing on a minority group but judging by the outcome of the us elections it certainly seems like a very large minority plus whatever made up voted the russians added like i said its difficult not to be a hypocrite it shouldnt be difficult not to be a dickhead
are you seriously trying to argue that alternative sexual lifestyle indoctrination in primary schools is public debate
the question really is do we want a civil society where all people are included equally and the capacity to achieve their best as part of this we as society should be mindful of the barriers that exsist that limit people potential to achieve their best this includes tangible things such as ensuring that people with limited mobility can access public building by ensuring design of public buildings are accessible or using language that turns people into being less than human or less worthy as citizens who do not deserve same rights and privileges as other citizens history is full of examples of what happens when people are attributed as having attributes that make the them less than full citizens i must say i have no conception or idea of what the sin of political correctness is or belonging to elite is any more but i certainly do know what racism and the affect of punching down wards to limits the political and civil rights of others is next time someone complains about restrictive language consider whos position is at stake are they seeking to encourage an inclusive civil society or are they protecting their own place of power or privilege
dr aly said as a muslim she supported samesex marriage because she came from a culture where women often werent allowed such choice httpwwwtheaustraliancomaufederalelectionfederalelectionalysimpkinsgivecowanvotersachoicenewsstoryeebfcbbfebcf hopefully the discussion will not be shut down by lefties but free speech will prevail rather than political correctness why dont you email aly shorten and the greens and ask them for their opinion you can be critical of islam religion isnt covered by c if thats what you are worried about
youve just exercised how to be politically incorrect it didnt hurt anyone did it just show your own character
you could try not being a dickhead the guardian is not obliged to allow every article open to comment you managed to live most of your life i assume not commenting on the guardian get over yourself but like i said this is as much about your own safety as everyone elses listen to your teorrism experts for fuck sake
at a shopping centre a place id wish to avoid like a plague but on this occasion i couldnt because i was summoned to purchase an item without a moment notice i felt a sharp thug in my left leg and there was this mature aged woman pushing a wheelchair with an elderly rather frail looking lady she pushed her way in the aisle without giving me an opportunity to make way for her so i had to leap both in order to give way to her and to protect myself from the wheelchair i was gobsmacked by her attitude so did the elderly lady a bit peeved with me but suppressed my natural tendency to tell her off in a manner that would be deserving of her behaviour when someone is in a wheelchair their rudeness seems inexcusable after all after a bit of a distance i noticed she did look a bit miserable and both of them did look picture perfect despondent it will be online shopping from now on
like all labor politicians ann aly is required to support the party policy on ssm in the same way that penny wong was previously required to oppose it however i would be interested to hear her opinion on the isis terrorist recruiters second wife who refused to show her face covered by a burqa or stand in an australian court in fact it would be good if the population could hear from bill shorten and the greens on the subject hopefully the discussion will not be shut down by lefties but free speech will prevail rather than political correctness
reality check political correctness will only meet with passive resistance by displays of private contempt the creative human mind will find its own ways to evolve when suppressed obvious example guardian for example will choose not to allow public commentaries on issue affecting its canonised triggs to appease its own subscribers as shown in the article relating to defamation suits against the president of ahrc immigration amp refugees articles have lately been exempt from public commentaries as in the case of hamid kehazaei inquest perspective to silence dissents crude or rude is to breed a terrible weapon of suppression people should have the right to say i dont give a shit if that how they truly feel that right is not within the scope of freedom of expression but an inherent amp inalienable right beyond the claws of man made laws
politeness is what we do need along with empathy and compassion and reason absolutely
oopsdisabled person was meant to be disabled person as in ation marks not inverted commas indicating sarcasm
properly framed your disability wont stop you doing but elements in society will
yes playground banter is still punctuated with occasional cries of spastic and retard but for the most part this stems from an ignorance as to the origins and meanings of these words and they would no longer be considered socially acceptable in the public arena  in my youth spastic was an adjective used to describe a disabled person who had a spasticity tightness in the body same with retarded simply meaning a person whose progress was below average a bit slow and never meant as insultsthe fact that some people use them as insults is a reason for them to be no longer socially acceptable even if some of us oldies still slip in using the words as descriptions not meant as insults the same principles apply to racism sexism and homophobia most people would agree that school is the right place to challenge children to think about the kind of language they use its a public arena where kids learn about mutual respect a principal we hope they will take into the wider world teaching that lesson is made harder when the language of politics is indistinguishable from the cruelty of the playground its time our elected officials raised their game it is but bullies will always find words to hurt and unfortunately some of those officials put disabled into inverted commas to show sarcasm or disbelief that the person really is disabled like wanting to get people under  off disability welfare because they associate disability with aged or birth defects totally ignoring the fact many disabilities are caused by accidents perhaps it would help if the statistics showed the amount of people badly injured in car and work place accidents instead of only deaths and the old saying sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me has been proven many times over to be false in that words can cause longer lasting harm
political correctness is synonymous with good manners it used to be now it is a way to justify ageism racism and sexism
political correctness used to be about inclusion but it has now become a way of defending racism ageism and sexismwhite old men are bad young females preferably black or asian are goodany dissent from this and you are either racist or a misogynist it has been perverted in the same way modern feminism has its now all about special deals
lets start by you defining the difference between learning and indoctrination
political correctness is synonymous with good manners children do need to be educated into good manners a task usually accomplished within the family im not sure that good manners or political correctness could accurately be described as a doctrine rather it is an attentiveness to the fact that we live together in the world and do better if we try to get along
you are slightly correct its better to phrase things to target the behaviour as racism sexism islampphobia than to phrase it as a property of the individua
the difference between someone who is racist and those who are targets of their racism is that you do not choose which race you are born into but you do choose the degree of respect that you offer others the same goes for homophobia and isalmophobia racists and their like are incorrect to believe that they are unfairly targeted it is important to the wellbeing of our society that behaviour that is unfair and often amounts to bullying is called out
interesting that you perceived as a convert to paraplegia as gentle levity i perceived it very differently as a misguided attempt at a new form of politically correct language you might be right perhaps i misjudged the authors intentions
where is the example that you were asked to provide of how you had been shut down youre funny how do you show evidence when your comment is deleted
they stand for election sprout vitriol excite enough idiots to get themselves elected and then they run the country into the ground
i was not born with paraplegia it resulted from an accident or illness  expresses the same thing but i enjoyed the gentle levity of i was a convert to paraplegia in a serious article
it seems we all want our children to be civilised its a pity we cant agree to be civilised so just to clarify is name calling racial vilification and discrimination in all its glory the civilised behaviour of a scary future
the use of the words racist sexist islamophobia are used in the same way they are used by the left to insult isolate and shut down legitimate debate stop using these words and action and the right will tone down their language just because you are on the left does not mean you are automatically right nor is it your right to control the debate by silencing others
i love how you rail against silencing debate in your opening paragraph and then appeal for censorship of stuff you dont like in the next
i spent six years working in a program for profoundly disabled people where social inclusion was our specialty and in all that time i cannot recall a single case of a child being disrespectful and frankly i cannot see that changing because of trumpi find your arguments are either out of date or they relate to circumstances in your state alone and not the whole of australiathe ndis was formed for the soul purpose of using federal cash to prop up the victorian and nsw state governments who had neglected their disabilities sectors for decadesother states had perfectly functional disabilities sectors but the only way to prop up victoria and nsw without the other states complaining of feather bedding was to have a nation system
pc is an attempt to legislate for decency bound to fail in a world
indeed the validity of the criticism should be measured in the relevance of the arguments brought to bare in the context of known facts criticism should not be disqualified on the basis of the identity of either party
im very sorry you have suffered such a terrible injury but is it really respectful to those in the same position to describe it with words suggestive of an adopter persuaded of the merits of what is being adopted indeed one doesnt convert to paraplegia in the way that one converts to say judaism
you are correct here a huge double standard exists black people can call themselves niggers but white people cannot im gay and i can call other faggots faggots but others cannot somehow this is not right and i can fully see how it really angers some
touche
hear hear
ummmyou just indulged in post truth by immediately linking defending downs syndrom kids against abuse to the same kids being aborted befoe birth im sorry there is no real conenction political correctness can be very coercive especially when people of colour are allowed to white shame with impunity but what we should discuss is the overreach of some activists rather than closing down the entire ethos of a caring society there is a difference
convert to paraplegia is a rather more sinister term than any playground insult i have heardand quite suggestive of the difference between politeness and respect on one hand and political correctness on the other im very sorry you have suffered such a terrible injury but is it really respectful to those in the same position to describe it with words suggestive of an adopter persuaded of the merits of what is being adopted and where does it leave those born with a similar condition as for insults to children with downs syndrome political correctness would obsess over playground insults while cheering on the eugenic elimination of downs people in utero its not about respect which children should be taught its about control judging by the safe space zealots this is what they are in fact being taught political correctness is a name given to a pathological authoritarianism that is doing incalculable damage to western societies and latterly spawning opposing forces which are as bad its time this toxic post truth nonsense was binned and the cloak it hide behind that it is a a new way of describing politeness is torn down it is anything but politeness is what we do need along with empathy and compassion and reason we do not need an ideological dogma that exploits grievance to attack the functioning of free society
youre not making sense who and where are all the people with abusive things to say simmering away inside them whats wrong with them
standing up for fundamentalists to exist in a modern society very nice
but lets make sure that islam is firmly on the table when it comes to criticism why islam in particular as opposed to religion
sounds like an opinion not a factthough with your indoctrination upon these pages another one who missed irony lessons indoctrination upon these pages is not only an opinion but one with no foundation in fact
very nice where is the example that you were asked to provide of how you had been shut down also extra points where your opinion on the ways of life of others is called for valid and justified
there seems to be two types of people in this debate those who think political correctness is a synonym for measured language and those who think it is something more than that to imply that the latter dont think measured language is a good thing is by and large a straw man
i agree go for itbut lets make sure that islam is firmly on the table when it comes to criticism
the rights claims that people should toughen up and love being called racially abusive terms is disgusting and disgenuous human beings are social creatures and our selfesteem and happiness is partly based on being accepted by our communities there is a word for someone who is completely indifferent to others and the word is sociopath if you use the n word you evoke the language culture and history of white supremacy and it is completely right that people should be offended basically insults and namecalling are not debate they are the absence of debate they are not dailogue but abuse and denifration now the right has all but destroyed the working class and middle class with the voodoo economics of trickle down all they have to offer the population is empty slogans of hate and vilification they cant create good jobs or growth so they scapegoat instead
if your porn is misogynistic racist sexist homophobic trans phobic abelist etc then i strongly suggest that you find new porn vote with your ummm feet
sounds like an opinion not a factthough with your indoctrination upon these pages i can understand how you find it difficult to differentiate
political correctness is a doctrine fostered by a delusional illogical minority and rabidly promoted by an unscrupulous mainstream media which holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a turd by the clean end so is christianity which we very expensively sponsor with our tax dollars
if you had an open discussion on here on the fundamentalist ways of some in this country from the three major religions you would have your comment deleted you also dont see discussion in article or opinion pieces being very direct about what not is part of australian culture or the rights of children being raised in various oppressive religions and cults
is that many teachers are running with a particular socioculturalpolitical agenda and school chaplains are not at a cost of  million also there is no evidence at all for the existence of the supernatural entities in which the school chaplains beleive without indoctrination said entities wouldnt exist
same political correctness is now turned around and used to shut down discussion about some peoples way of life and here you are openly discussing it please give an example of where you have been shut down in your discussion of anything where you havent been racist bigoted or openly offensive extra points where your opinion on the ways of life of others is called for valid and justified perhaps all that is required is that you suck your scone in and mind that which is your own business
the thing is that who we view as being beyond the pale varies from person to person there are people who have deplorable attitudes towards people with disabilities and people who are lgbti and vulnerable people should not be called derogatory names people can use derogatory terms but they can and will face ire for doing so that sounds pretty fair to me
so agreed i was told with my disability i could do anything i spend years trying it would have been easier if someone has said the reality of things is this so structure your life accordingly
nope unlike you i was stating a fact
heres how choosing not to offend can backfire as a younger bloke my desire was to join the fire service i was fit and well suited and at no stage during careers at school was i ever dissuaded towards that goal one little problem i have a profound hearing disability which sucks serious balls to the extent it was  weather i was sent to the deaf school or mainstreamso i left school applied and was informed that under no circumstances would i be considered because of my disability again funnily my disability which ruled me out of many occupations wasnt considered bad enough to get any assistance so i went and did a metal trades preapprenticeship only to find out that there was bugger all chance of an employer putting me on because of the fear of future legal problems about  years of my life was wasted because at no time and yes its my fault for being pig headed and refusing to take the mantle of disabled did anyone point out that life isnt fair and i was wasting my time and effort tilting at windmills the you can do anything is just as shit advice as hey useless deaf bastard read my lips is
another whataboutism from you
if pc is out the door can we start criticising the mps who make policy decisions based on their faith for which there is zero empirical evidence if people want criticism of islam on the table we need to have a discussion about all religious mps making decisions on behalf of all australians who believe in shit without evidence inb ann aly she is pro ssm if thats where you were going the whole idea of a conscience vote is laughable it isnt representative of the nation its representative of the worldviewsfeelings of x amount of mps
you want indoctrination look no further than gps and elite private schools
id put good money on you having no evidence for this
honesty has little to do with it i think that my football team is the bees knees but i know that objectively they are just above average so bias neednt come in to play i personally feel no distress is i offend someone if i believe that they are truly awful a spouse beater or a religious but for instance finding an appropriate term is always the right thing if i desired to referred to as a badger it wouldnt be societys duty to call me that just because i wanted to a nocturnal mammal
i dont think that political correctness debates have much to do with this article he writes about how political correctness helped the disabled get into a better place ok well i want to be able to discuss the myriad of cultures in australia to ensure that every australian child grows up to enjoy the benefits of a society where political correctness helped us free women gay people and so on but that same political correctness is now turned around and used to shut down discussion about some peoples way of life which involves very much winding back the gains won by the very efforts that now help them remain in the stone age funny how that turned out
so then in your world bullying in schools is fine
what if your honesty reflects bias for example some people do feel it is fine to call someone a hopeless cripple and would say that is just being honest i personally feel pain if i cause distress to someone else so i am quite content to use the words they prefer me to use i want to use words that dont hurt vulnerable people i do not like causing distress
the only problem with the assertion that schools are the right place to challenge children about the language they use is that many teachers are running with a particular socioculturalpolitical agendaschools should be a place of learning not indoctrination
political correctness is a doctrine fostered by a delusional illogical minority and rabidly promoted by an unscrupulous mainstream media which holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a turd by the clean end
sex ed should include anal sex there are risks and ways to mitigate risks unfortunately a  year old boy is likely to learn everything he knows about anal sex from porn
i will not engage in any conversation about percentage of population because we will not reach any point of agreement on that but just say x a  year old boy in highschool identifies as gay and has a boyfriend x and boyfriend have been engaging in sexual activity wouldnt you think it sensible for x to have access to lgbti sex education so that he understands the risks and knows how to mitigate them you would also want him to know what sexual practices are safest and what the risks may be it would also be useful to have frank conversations about some of the symptoms when things go wrong might even be good for x to feel accepted i have a family friend whose sex ed comprised a jar of vaseline and a box of tissues on her wedding night she was terrified is it fair to x that his only access to sex ed relating to lgbti is through the internet x learns from content that may include porn and misinformation essentially the quality if sex ed for x is the equivalent of being given vaseline and tissues hang on x isnt even afforded that x is instead called a poof i would like to see all kids have access to sex ed that reflects their sexual preferences how else will x learn how to reduce the risks associated with anal sex whether you like it or not lgbti kids are sexually active and they do need access to information that is respectful and non judgemental this is about health and wellbeing
isnt it just a case of context and manners for instance i would never use the term cripple in regards to disability as it has an innate pejorative element at least nowadays on the flipside i wouldnt use a phrase which neither describes the situation at hand in a honest way for the sake of offence manners and context are the critical factors
all that volcano imagery climaxing in panic over gay sex education you can write this stuff
well played and beautifully put although we are all hypocrites heres my slightly less subtle sledgehammer response it basically all goes back to hitler ive written a post on moral racism elsewhere theres certain things you dont say because bad shit happens really bad shit its serious words most certainly do have consequences leaving aside the fact that we really should try and avoid being dick heads to each other as much as possible the reason you dont say certain things is because they can make the world a lot less safe one of many reason you dont slag off ethnic or disabled groups is because it creates a general climate where these groups can be attacked as in physically and also mentally one of many reason you dont slag off muslims is because you end up doing the extremists jobs for them people need to understand that pcness is not a game sure some people are too easily outraged but that is a better and safer predisposition than that of trump who plays on peoples fears with dangerous consequences
the last bastion of political incorrectness is pornography where even the liberal left agrees that you can be misogynistic racist sexist homophobic trans phobic abelist etc because hey free speech
so far my experience on this score has been decidedly mixed id say if you are stuck with ill health of a variable nature the system will treat you as if you are normalwhich you are not and then blames you for your problems when it cant or wont address them its a basic form of victim blaming even worse if you dont want to be seen as a victim you are expected to pretend you are normalwhich you are notand therefore the only reason you arent succeeding is because you are normally lazywhich you are not last night i had a lady asking for money to eat because she was starving the neoliberal model is to tell her to pull her socks up go and scrub up put on some pearls and a good brand pant suit apply for a stack of highend jobs orand i love this bitshe could start a business thanks centrelink meanwhile she just wanted a meal to get through the night another guy had his belongings and his approx ten year old son in a shopping trolley until a couple of weeks ago i had never seen that before in the cbd a few years ago the homeless were people with particular problems that led to their homelessness now it is the sudden loss of a job that tips people over the edgewith only the promise of a safety net for it was quietly withdrawn for hundreds of thousands of australians our societys ethical compass isnt just broken it is stuck pointing in exactly the wrong direction
so who are all these people with abusive language simmering away inside them and what happens when they explode you get president trump and possibly president le pen
yes many things are on a pendulum our society decided its wrong to be deliberately cruel to people based on race gender ability etc and what was socially acceptable changed but the pendulum keeps swinging criticise a woman and you are sexist criticise an indigenous person you are a racist criticise or questions aspects of islam and you are islamophobic and racist criticise a gay person and you are homophobic plus because they are the priveleged none of this applies to white men so you can be as nasty as you like about them same with christians a black person says im black and proud is fine a white person says im white and proud and they are a racist white supremicist its no wonder some get fed up
thanks i didnt even think to look for a website
going off on a bit of a tangent i get a little concerned about language use such as costly scheme like ndismyself it is quite evident from media comments and pub discussions that there is anassumption that this scheme is totally greenfields and the monies to bespent are all a new item to the budget bottom line this is simply not the case monies previously spent by states on disability programs and by charities most of whom obtain more funding from federal and state grants than fromdonations will be rolled into this scheme as will funding previously used bythe federal govt to fund its own disability programs one of which was closed down some months ago saving  million annually in other words ndis will not be a brand spanking new set of costs to the taxpayer and the budget much of the money being spent on disability programs currently and up until recently will be channelled into ndis the positive is that it will be universal and accessible to all that need it unlike the current set of systems that vary from state to state and regionby region and across all disability cohorts yes there is much needed new funding going into ndis to purchase servicesfor people with disabilities all contracted out however a significant amount of funding was already in place via other programs and state budgets
ndis is a classic example of an almost forgotten principle of government whether conservative or liberal the idea that there is a public good and that the proper role of government is to ensure that public resources are committed to the provision of that public good if only current neoliberal and altright politicians were committed to the idea more fully we would have less prattle about eliminating political correctness to preserve my sacred right to abuse and insult any group i choose pick a target any target and more action to benefit the entire community amp not fatten the pockets of my little mates in the big end of town
well it goes without saying that trumps vitriol knows no boundary simply because the msm subscribes to it political correctness is linguist language of choice it is an acquired taste for the diplomatically aligned sensitive soul culturally learned and those with fetish for satire it does not require an aptitude test because it is an emotionally based language skill and to force it into the political underworld makes disneyland stranger than fiction because to take it literally there is nothing correct about being political there is social inclusion and empowerment even when it is imperfectly in conflict with discriminatory reality when we feel safe within that ambit of contradictions and conflict you are allowed to be politically incorrect and enjoy the language of larrikinism in other words disable or not black or white everyone needs to chill out unfortunately we have remarkably different ability to perceive the nature and substance of political correctness before you teach children to parrot those terms political correctness in a landscape of very unequal and unfair policy decisions might find the language of correctness a tad futile because even if we learn the language of political correctness we could all end up as highly qualified hypocrites
ndis only recently finished its trial period and has onlybeen available in some parts of australia to date politics as usual has delayed the originally intended fullroll out it is now in its national roll out phase and will implementedaustralia wide over the next  months it will replace many of the services currently provided by stategovts where they exist and will also change the way the charitiesprovide services the politics between states and the feds plus negotiations withthe existing disability industry have seen some of the delays andchanges to the original model proposed the ndia website provides a good overview of the intent and purpose of the scheme the actual name of the agency responsiblefor implementation is the national disability insurance agencyhence the change in the acronym
actually while im procrastinating it seems that offensiveness is the new anarchy i will tell a joke simply to get a rise out of someone who wants to be offended on behalf of the jokes subject try it its very liberating
so who are all these people with abusive language simmering away inside them and what happens when they explode
what is lgbti sex ed surely at the most basic level theres a hole and a pole
its not that people dont try to be respectful its just that language it policed to the nth degree and what is deemed offensive seems to change every five minutes even worse proper and meaningful debate is shut down by such accusations and merely widens the ideological gap further
the ndis idea has been around for a long while now and i know its something good im embarrassed to say but i dont actually know what it is or how it works im still yet to see a media reportarticle that explains it the media seems to assume everyone understands it
most dont agree most agree with teaching civil behaviour but not teaching lgbtisex ed in school completely madeup fabricatred nonsense
in australia recent accusations in parliament of political correctness raise the question do we want our political representatives using measured language when discussing matters of policy it is not about measured language it is about silencing debate the issues dont go away they just go underground and simmer away like a volcano ready to explode and explode it will silencing is not the solution silencing never fixed any problem the same principles apply to racism sexism and homophobia most people would agree that school is the right place to challenge children to think about the kind of language they use most dont agree most agree with teaching civil behaviour but not teaching lgbtisex ed in school
newsflash other countries are allowed to have their own language and culture which are different from ours and they will decide on and handle developments not us ps who decided that we brits should now have to speak american not english
just forget assigning gender to things unless they actually have a gender
eglish has spread around the world becoming globish because it is a very simple language to master the basics of any tourist can order a beer and a meal in english in peking budapest or athens because the basic words and grammar are so simple fortunately or unfortunately romance languages are far more difficult to get to grips with at a basic level this does not mean that the should be dumbed down for external consumption quite the reverse their inherent structure and elegance should be maintained
the worst kind of fascist
theyre called lady actors
officially shes the sovereign so its inclusive 
the problem with the french is they have no word for entrepreneur
oh cmon the french take credit for spreading the french language in every country that speaks french as in the francophonie you can give the english credit that america exists in the first place america speaks english because it was founded by english people
they are canadian fascists
gibberish
i have long held the belief that it is the written aspect of french combined with the creation of academie francaise that is responsible for the frozen nature of french unlike english which is a natural language and peoples language that has never been under the restriction of any institution partly because it spread out across the world before it could be corralled so it stayed organic and dynamic adapting and evolving with the times and the cultural environment french unfortunately never had that chance it has been the prisoner of the academie like latin was of the vatican clergy and sanskrit of the brahmins and could go the way those  languages went if they dont relent to the peoples wishes i have been teaching english in france for the last  years and understand how the people feel the academie lives in its ivory tower and will surely bring french to a disastrous end if it doesnt wake up its ironic that the french who are among the pioneers in science do not understand the principles of evolution in culture and human affairs the false pride of being pure and untainted in a universe whose very definition is flux and change
if i were one id be an actress
describing genderneutral text as an aberration that puts the language in mortal danger i fully agree with the academie genderneutral language is a phenomenon which is an anglosaxon phenomenon facilitated by the virtual absence of gender in english french is a much more inflected language genderneutral language doesnt work not is it desirable
formerly in some societies only men could become actors and womens roles were generally played by men or boys this is the true history of it wikipedia an actor cannot easily play a female role he would need additional training of voice and mannerisms an actress would just need to know how to act and her default skills would suffice an actor and an actress therefore have different abilities no they have exactly the same abilities acting a good actor can even play different genders its been going on for centuries of course everyone has different traits you can dress a this person to look fat for a part but not vice versa same for tall people and children but we dont need to give them different names man woman fat tall they can just all be actors
etymology dear words have roots and the suffix or from latin denotes a person or agent whereas the suffix ess denotes a female thus it makes no sense to have men take the noun form ending in ess
the academy is not authoritarian no one in france listen to them
no one in france pays attention to what the academy has to say you should be aware of that inclusive writing will be rejected by french speakers simply because you cant decide to change the language overnight anf if english has thrived its because of americas economic might not because you dont have an english academy
thats not the point mw is making though given that americans often use the past for the perfect its ironic that he should have you been to new york  isnt the same as were you in new york  the perfect suggests something done in a period still reflecting the present the past is past without the connection mark williams is saying this distinction is lost
which means you cant all of a sudden impose inclusive writing
english bien sûr
the academy can talk all it wants languages follow their own path regardless whether you like it or not
to solve the problem of directrices directeurs why not directorsoops too much like english and that would never do for the académie française pardon mamon merde
kind of like chomskys vague rhetoric
bring back thou
yes another massive tick for english
nah it is probably that some of the french are exactly like the british and a great many others in that they cannot suppress there own dark nationalistic tendencies there is a reason that we in the americas refer to yall as being part of the old world
not often i agree with the académie about anything but on this topic they are right i note that some anglophone actresses now want to be called actors sigh
the reason is that german is a more demanding language eg on labelling the parts of a sentence according to subject object indirect object in english syntax is the most pressing task as meaning is derived from the word order of items german sentences can in theory be uttered in any order as the individual parts clearly indicate who does what to whom and with what or who making a mistake in german can be confusing to the interlocutors substituting i for me is not confusing and thus done all the timethere are plenty of examples of poor german too which are easily discovered if you live there long enough so laziness or paying no attention to prescribed forms is not a preserve of english
ive disagreed with a lot of what he says too but everyone is usually right some of the timeand this issue just seems like another trivial distraction for the masses
leftwing fascism who needs the rightwing variety
part of the problem is that masculine and feminine as a grammatical concept is of a different order to the biological concept the categories overlap but theyre not equivalents we could more easily change the grammatical terms masculine and feminine than run through the whole lexicon of a language no german thinks of a german girl as a thing or any living diminutive in fact nor do spaniards think of a leaf as a woman or a tree as a man in fact many grammatically masculine words in romance have the typically feminine ending a some words lend themselves to change others dont where the morphology accepts change it makes sense where it doesnt its better to find another alternative
correct
the canadian language has been heavily influenced by french every other syllable is ehaisaié
frencha beautiful language but the af spoil and stifle its development this article exemplifies the stupidity of such a body thankfully our own wonderful english language has no such policing body and look how it has thrived and become the global language
the existence of this authoritarian academie and of mandatory government schools and textbooks is the greater problem
interesting idea i think its more likely star comes directly from whatever the saxons used to say for the modern german word stern which is of course male
which language does god speak
it would certainly apply to the modern day saviours our revered social justice warriors
let me guess male
ahh fucktwittery is not a word expect a knock on the door very very soon in the meantime i suggest you learn about english compadre
httpsenwikipediaorgwikicambodian_genocide_denialchomsky_and_herman you dont have to be a rightwing nutbar to dislike chomsky i think hes a silly man because he never actually says what he wants to happen hes just a hater talk to a libertarian or a communist and at least they have a point of view chomsky on the other hand just shits on everything with no ideas or solutions he criticizes every single thing without offering any substantive alternative
je suis entièrement daccord
i like how they all look up in the picture as if god is speaking in french to their deluded sense of reality
wow clearly your silly comment been awaiting moderation prior to the advent of the internet
i think lacademie are correct here those words are horribly clunky i support the notion of inclusive writing on the abstract but its merits shouldnt excuse it from the standards of elegance which make french such a beautiful language
i think the main offensive thing is the plural not the gender itself a queen is a queen because shes female and a king is a king because hes male thats not sexist what is sexist is having a group of  women and  man in a group and then using the masculine les to refer to the group in that case youre not just using gender but giving the male dominance
once in a while being a well informed pedant is very beneficial great comment thank you
better stop sexing animals too while were at it no more ganders and bulls and cows and mares and stallions and bitches well we might need to hang on to the latter thats rather desperate you need better arguments
do you have a link to support your assertion or are you just another rightwing nutbar
gotta disagree but apparently you crave being ruled by outdated patriarchs
i believe the correct terminology is frenchwoman
as they famously said some years ago no sex please were british
true languages go their own way if by this you mean the natural evolution of a language over time no debatebut what is happening here is not at all natural evolutionone movement is trying to destroy the beauty of language for a very convoluted ideal the other is trying to preserve it
what is with the french and their use of lingual nationalism in quebec we have language police one of their most recent victories was uncovering an italian restaurant that had the temerity to use the word pasta on their menu im sorry but the french seem to have a very dangerous bent towards fascism in all manner of daily life telling women what they can wear is not only deeply offensive to the tenets of freedom by any measure it also seems to be a favourite pastime in the culture
yes but african cultures are more likely to share the afs viewpoint
for all the english speakers who are taking this opportunity to bash the academie french and france here is a suggestionget together and convince the queen to find a new word to describe itself queen is unambiguously genderloaded as the next person to sit on the throne is almost certainly likely to be called king unless of course you go the other way and decree that charles william and george will be known as queens which would quite interesting
you are born to play it not really a kim kardashian is a construct a role a female is someone who is born with the right genitals a male drag queen has more in common with kim kardashian than i do
do not think that a linguistic mission will solve gender equality this a pathetic attempt to move the real focus of the question equality between men and women not two theoretical genders but persons we cannot start from the language and believe this is an answer the psychological approach that could give a sense of assurance or justice is a mere demagogic issue whose aim is to mortify either male or female surely it is much easier to treat a grammar question instead wasting time and energies uselesslylet parliaments vote laws to abolish discrimination and governments put in practise policies against it let judges give the just punishment to abhorrent sexual crimes without excuses all the rest is chatter
but that doesnt help much either imagine the doctor saying congratulations youve just had a wonderful baby
better stop sexing animals too while were at it no more ganders and bulls and cows and mares and stallions and bitches well we might need to hang on to the latter
and semitic
what a load of garbage theres no special meaning behind any of this its just grammar jeez
you can express the difference between i ate and i have eaten in french just like marina said jai mangé une pomme hierje mange des pommes depuis que je suis enfant i have eaten only the present depuis is used to express it
er no read up on your shakespeare
i remember i did a summer abroad in alicante where i was staying with a family i guessed the word was la abogada to refer to a female lawyer which started a huge fight between the daughter of the family and her dad over whether or not a female lawyer was la abagado or la abagada
you are born to play it 
i believe the correct terminology is lady manager lady director and lady commentator or maybe you mean that the correct terminology may easily be gentleman manager gentleman director and gentleman commentator for male versions yeah it sounds ridiculous doesnt it as ridiculous as lady manager
it is always a pleasure to hear a frenchman speaking to me in english
if i had to cast the role of kim kardashian and my only choices were olivier and you i would still choose you without seeing the appearances mannerisms and talents of me and oliver you might be making the wrong choice
how the hell did that guy get  up votes for equating arms which both men and women have to vaginas which only women have am i living in crazy land here
acteractor can you show me examples of how the suffix ess makes new nouns from verbs
i agree a horrible person and the above statement is so generic it can apply to everything and nothing
presumably because star étoile the word star comes from ishtar a female goddess
a person who acts is an actor do you talk about managresses directresses and commentresses i believe the correct terminology is lady manager lady director and lady commentator
vive la france
indeed and it is even more weird than that if  women are in a room with  butterfly masculine ils se dirigent vers la porte theymasculine go to the door the masculine whatever it is always wins it was not such in the xviii century but inclusive writing would be very complicated in french add to it the already disastrous level of young generations concerning regular spelling for instance you have  men and  women it gives ilselles sont allées à la plage they went to the beach feminizing titles is usually fine and easy but not always for instance when you talk to a lawyer the title is maître if it is a woman it would become maîtresse which could mean that she is a teacher for young kids or that she has an affair with someone
chomsky just doesnt know the difference between limiting the spectrum of acceptable opinion and shutting down bullshit during the khmer rouge chomsky dismissed the numerous reports of massacre and famine under pol pot as unreliable and accepted all the khmer rouge propaganda at face value then he whined and moaned about main stream media narrative trying to smear the khmer rouge like a little bitch
your problem is that you assume there is a standard mother tongue or that everyone has the same command style or even communication pattern in it variety is good and what creates a diverse and interesting world from biodiversity to intra national peculiarities blanket statements on standards serve a confirmation biased viewpoint on them
why not a new word li bras for both
and they had to count more votes when womens suffrage was granted terrible
what no citoyens
the lack of an academy doesnt stop prescriptivists publishers exam bodies or the british council acting as gate keepers to what is acceptable pedants politicians and those who learned it another way routinely belie and moan about correct english and routinely spread false rules on ending sentences with prepositions verbification of nouns pronunciation based on a dictionary prestige form spoken by less than  of people in the uk and all manner of other areas of the language meanwhile the pace of change with english is being directed by those who use it daily as a contact language see kachru on world englishes or research into english as lingua franca which suggests a growing acceptability among its speakers of nonstandard forms change is inevitable but academy or not there is plenty of opposition from those left behind or at odds with the modern world i suspect it is the notion of gender neutral as a social fact which irks the traditional immortals and their immutable description of france
lacadémie française is certainly retrograde but this is not about determining whether another english word can be deemed acceptable or not or what unwieldy french expression  times as long should be used instead this is about an attempt to transform the language in a pointless trendy waygenderconscious is what french is even the word star is strictly feminine presumably because star étoile the idea that it can be transformed into a genderneutral language is ridiculous and the initiative that saw the publication of a genderneutral textbook is ludicrousthis is not about language evolution this is about an attempt to transform the language by force
gender kind of sucks in a language but its still way better than the subjunctive fuck the subjunctive
indeed why are they all actors why not actresses a male actress
probably because the french are transphobic or something
du redest kohl its masculine and not just the largerthanlife late bundeskanzler
i do speak french and yes these words are clumsy beyond usability their imposition brings a disservice to the cause of equality since language is the tool of thought they make the very ideas they are supposed to promote sound artificial and prosthetic want equality practice it until the bad meaning fade out of the words
everyone is not a plural noun which is correct everyone is here or everyone are here
we already have im a professional translator and i often use theytheirthem as gender neutral forms because it is increasingly the norm
depends on what you mean by playing not the same as imitation i am a director if i had to cast the role of kim kardashian and my only choices were olivier and you i would still choose youthe job of an actress was introduced simply because people realized that female roles should be played by women no male expert or a teenage boy can or should replace them as was the tradition at the time of shakespeare
so youve given one example and as mirjam urfer points out its not even a good one and to say that an editor said he couldnt be bothered with double designations is hardy proof the germans are rowing back is it and politesse is not a female police person but a traffic warden female designation because most of them are or were female perhaps you hear it less because more men are now doing that job there isnt even come to think of it a masculine term for this
we dont wa
all the other esses surely you meant esseees
most verb forms in romance languages arent actually gendermarked though past participles often are adjectives are a bigger issue as for the neuter youd need to reinvent this because the majority of romance languages lost this centuries ago an exception is romanian which does have a neuter gender neuter nouns are effectively masculine in the singular but they magically become feminine in the plural
how did this happen
cate is still an actress that is her default category in spite of the experimentjaye is an actor who played a biological male
as a female i would need a lot of training to play kim kardashian a lot i think you are conflating personal differences with gender differences
tout à fait correct no anglicization required most particularly of this genre with its neutral pronouns and female actors
nor separate awards for actors and actresses
some job titles are categorised an actor cannot easily play a female role he would need additional training of voice and mannerisms an actress would just need to know how to act and her default skills would suffice an actor and an actress therefore have different abilities they are not interchangeable that is why there is a differentiation that is also why it makes sense in award ceremonies
a fossilised language guarded by the  dinosaurs of a fossilised and xenophobic institution and presumably at great public expensea new word can only gain recognition after the academy has failed to stop itnegative and double negativelanguages evolve trying to obstruct evolution seems a very impoverished ambition
queen sultan or han it can be male or female the great sultan elisabeth han it has a nice ring to it
you are always going to need an actor for a male role and an actress for a female role or you might need cate blanchett to play bob dylan and then there is jaye davidson in crying game does this make them an actor or an actress
please refer to maurice grévisse le bon usage grammaire française hatier the bible in french grammar have a good weekend
but men dont have vaginas so it does seem odd its masculine in french
in french this lost neuter gender is automaticaly expressed by masculinbs or you dont know what you mean with neutral gender then you mix up the lack of feminine form of nouns maire écrivain with the gender of pronouns there can be a neutral but also masculine and feminine
la bite oh its so sexist 
how do you remove gender from a romance language demand all verbs be conjugated in the neuter
hmm not sure about that the job is being an actor it didnt matter what the specific role is we dont need a different term for actors that play each of the different roles one might play should we have a different name for black actors older actors its the same with musicians they play different parts or instruments but they are all musicians i think youve confused the part with the job a little
probably female
no but you are missing the present perfect there is no way to translate i have eaten from english perfectly to french because french has no present perfect jai mangé passé composé french pronunciation paˈse kɔpoˈze compound past is the most commonly used past tense in the modern french language it is used to express an action that has been finished completely or incompletely at the time of speech or at some possibly unknown time in the past the passé composé originally corresponded in function to the english present perfect but is now used mainly as the equivalent of the simple past httpsenwikipediaorgwikipassca_composca french used to use the passe compose the same way as in english
a new creature
it looks like programming code
exactly you are always going to need an actor for a male role and an actress for a female rolein a same way we differentiate between a soprano and a tenor
je mangeais used for an habit in the past jai mangé for an event in the past
in english i have eaten passe compose in english means almost the same thing as i ate passe simple in english there is a very subtle difference in that you are emphasizing different things french no longer has this subtle difference once it combined the passe compose with the simple
it all exists in english i can see what you are doing though french has no present perfect the passe compose of french is the present perfect of english i have lived in this house i think that french people used to use the passe compose just like we do in english the problem is that when french people started replacing the passe simple with the passe compose  years ago you lost the original distinct meaning of the passe compose by combining it with what would normally have been the passe simple i speak spanish well and spanish has the same tenses as english in the same way the spanish tenses are what french used to be like before it lost the passe simple its clear that when french replaced the passe simple with the passe compose they lost the distinction imperfect englishi was hunting i started hunting in the past until some later point in time maybe even until the present if you found me in the woods with a rifle and i said i was hunting then i might still be hunting ori used to hunt when i was younger or i would hunt when i was younger i repetitively used to hunt as a habit it is implied that i no longer hunt or i would have just said i hunt passe simple english i hunted yesterday there is no equivalent to english an action started in the past and still goes on in the present how long have you been in this house french use the present
good on the académie not because im especially antipc but because directeurtrices or what have you is a really ugly solution and could we please get rid of comedienne in english ugh
i dont think any language should evolve in such a way that includes putting two full stops in the middle of a word

so how would you complete the sentence everyone worries about growing old _______ ________ easy dont you ha ha oh all right then dont they its plural because everyone is a collective noun for at least three people
the french language is difficult enough to learn without adding complications that serve no useful function
a cabbage in german is feminine a girl neuter
a cabbage is german is female a girl neuter
queen
my online australian university tutor refused to identify itself as male or female as that would prejudice my attitude
not a fair comparison because an actor and an actress do not fill the exact same rolewhereas i would expect a manager to perform the same role function regardless of their gender
chomsky the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum yeah id file this debate under that categorymacron will be delighted that the french are wasting energy arguing about this nonsense
the academy is ridiculed in france on such scale that they and their monolythic conception of our language and the rest of the world for that matter will die of irrelevance long before french itself
tenses in french literally follow the clock plusqueparfait is an action prior to a passécomposé action imparfait within those sentences is used to describe what goes around those main actions there is no equivalent to english an action started in the past and still goes on in the present how long have you been in this house french use the present
a person who acts is an actor do you talk about managresses directresses and commentresses
i thought människa was gender neutral han hon människor not that i know swedish grammar particularly well and hon is indeed used as you point out
the passé simple tense disappeared in the early sixties the imparfait is an equivalent use the third person singular and plural of the passé simple are still used in the context of history how can the imparfait be the equivalent of the passe simple imperfect tenses mean the action is in progress whereas preterit tenses like the passe simple emphasize that it was completed in the past they emphasize different things i speak spanish and spanish uses both the passe simple preterit passe compose present perfect and imparfait imperfect i believe that french used to use these  past tenses the exact same way spanish does french just had to drop the passe simple in spoken form because passe simple je cherchaiimparfait je cherchais they sound the same what french has done is essentially use the present perfect in place of the preterit which makes no sense france has essentially lost a past tense due to the fact that every other syllable in french is aisé
those terms are much too polite to translate bullshit it has to be conneries feminine plural by the way
the members of a board of directors are neither directeurs nor directrices they are administrateurstrices
i do not believe that the passé simple was a minister of educations idea here is a paper saying it was eliminated from oral spoken french between the th and th centuries did france have a minister of education  years ago the passe simple has survived in the literary language for graphical chronological and above all sociolinguistic reasons lucien foulet  claims that the passe simple was eliminated from oral frenchbetween the twelfth and sixteenth centuries by the passe compose which took on the functions of the preterit originally the passe compose tense reported past action with an effect upon the present such as in the english perfective i have studied french where an action beginning in the past is referred to from the point of view of the present as we have seen the passe compose has retained its original function to this day in the sentence de puis ia semaine derniere elle a lu deux romans since last week she has read two novels the passe simple cannot replace the passe compose depuis ia semaine passee elle lut deux romans httpwwwtandfonlinecomdoipdf the passé simple is definitively a historic french past tense that used to be used in spoken conversation its the same tense as the preterito in spanish
the germans do have the neuter but they also say schauspielerin when they refer to an actress and do not come up with nonsensical schauspieler when talking about her
ill rather hear the académie s opinion there are directives not the policepassé simple was a minister of educations idea fact
good not like the disrespectful guardian lumping actresses with actors there needs to be respect toward actresses waitresses stewardesses and all the other esses
bon
so how would you complete the sentence everyone worries about growing old _______ ________
i mean ancient egyptian hieroglyphics have been introduced to university the fact that the native lanaguage of these places had to be reintroduced shows that there wasnt much historical attention given to them im not even criticizing the french government policy of making everyone speak one lanaguage weve done it too and it is very effective at creating national unity im merely pointing out than the country of france does not have some historical story or interest in lanaguage for cultural or emotional reasons the promotion of the langue doil was solely for political reasons as in it was the lanaguage of the people who were in charge and if the passé simple was replaced that recently that just goes even more to show that lanaguages change and there is no reason to have an official lanaguage academypolice
german retained the protoindoeuropean system as did latin

i dont know i think it might have something to do with actual empirical historical fact rather than bare logical possibilities articulated in a disingenuous attempt to pretend inequalities dont exist compare the ingenious the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race problem solved over and out

the problem with england is that  years ago all the wealthy people from all over the country sent their kids to the same boarding schools it created a whole generation where all the elite no matter what part of the country they were from spoke with the same boarding school accent its crazy english people are very class conscious to begin with but the boarding schools made it so that the entire upper class spoke with the same accent no matter where they were from and the ordinary people still spoke with normal accents then the middle class people who didnt even go to boarding schools started speaking the upper class accent and anyone with a regional accent was considered lower class but before  years ago england used to be a normal country where even the rich people spoke their local accent before boarding schools were created
thank god common sense in an age of extreme pc fuckwittery

theyre masculine not genderneutral
breton and occitan have been reintroduced in universities in bretagne and provence alsatian never disappeared either from everyday life in alsace the passé simple tense disappeared in the early sixties the imparfait is an equivalent use the third person singular and plural of the passé simple are still used in the context of history
its an indoeuropean thing i dont think basque or magyar use the same noun classes
thank you france this whole genderneutral bs is nauseating so many problems in the world but these privileged people are so selfcentered they have to create problems to put themselves in the spotlight
why did french and most other romance languages lose the neuter
if lanaguage is such a part of history then what happened to breton or occitan most of brittany and southern france spoke those lanaguages up until only  years ago these languages disappeared because of french government policy to erase these lanaguage from history besides colonies might be young but weve been speaking the same lanaguage for the same amount of time my family has been speaking english for the same amount of time as any people in england its not like we restarted lanaguage culture and civilization from scratch when we crossed the atlantic  years ago in fact the colonial way of speaking is often even older and has more history than the mother country americans says fall and truck while english people say autumn and lorry fall and truck are older words i bet the there are lots of things people in quebec or louisiana say in french that are older and more original than what french people in france say hell i mean just a few  years ago france got rid of the passé simple you erased an entire past tense from your everyday spoken lanaguage and here youre talking about how old frenchs story is
not everyone is a man not everyone should be stuck with specifically masculine forms or for that matter specifically feminine ones
talk german instead at least for vagina there it is female but not genderneutral

gendererizing makes no sens to me either

i agree but a huge number of those are immigrants who alas so not feel that it is their own language even though they should feel some obligation to its being the language of their adopted country
simplistic what about a mixed roup or where one is just addressing human characteristics or simply a function or just a tree or cat or whatever

in australian english its youse
the gendererizing of french words makes no sense to me at all they need to make changes there is no logic to it
it really makes no difference in english there is nothing sexist about saying actress vs actor and people say both it only causes potential sexist problems in gendered languages where it has grammatical implications
i think english as a lanaguage is almost exclusively germanic there is french vocabulary but i dont think there is any grammar from latin lanaguages
why is it that people think of using masculine forms as being noninclusive why is it not thought of as women in sense taking over even masculine forms in word as opposed to women becoming masked by masculine words which are just words
any country where the language watchdogs hold that vagina is masculine le vagin has definite need of a genderneutral revolution or improved eye care
degender english too an actor is an actor there should be no such thing as an actress
 studierende is actually gender neutral thats why it is preferred to the plural form studenten of course my point is that it is now used in preference to studenten und studentinnen which was in vogue during the first rush of antigenderism in germany i was asked for examples of rowing it back
french people just take an overself conscious interest in their lanaguage because the french are sensitive to the decline of french

thom harrison i wouldnt call the trend you observe in english inverse the type of nouns you describe are normally gender neutral in english and they tend to end on or or er actoractress is an exception because it has a marked feminine form therefore the unmarked form is used for men however getting rid of the marked feminine form will just normalise the noun making the unmarked form genderneutral again just like the other gender neutral nouns of the same type such as teacher translator reader instructor which are sll gender neutral
latin has  grammatical genders masculine feminine neuter
the fact that romance languages except romanian have lost neuter grammatical gender that existed in latin is a difficultyin french this lost neuter gender is automaticaly expressed by masculin unfortunately our schoolmasters and schoolmistresses have stupidly said to generations of pupils le masculin lemporte sur le féminin for instance when speaking of a group of several things or persons of both genders when the truth was this is a neuter expressed as masculin by conventionin that context the idea that nouns of professions or functions should remain masculine only because this is neuter is simply unacceptable for which reason un professeur the majority of the teachers are actually women un écrivain un auteur un maire would never be une professeure une écrivaine une auteure une maire not une mairesse who is only the spouse of the mayor our modern society cannot remain stuck forever to language structures that do not reflect our reality and sooner or later probably later the académie française will endorse the practice and especially in the case of professions that were traditionally performed by men and men onlynevertheless i would not pull the plug on the académie resisting to progress is not automatically negative and discussing about the language is always positive
sorry but i have to correct you the german word for testicle is der hoden the form hode is rarely used and can be male as well as female derdie hode
studierende is actually gender neutral thats why it is preferred to the plural form studenten
the facts of life are that people are either male or female and language should identify them as such but that is what the change proposes that where a group comprises both men and women this is reflected in the description rather than that the presence of even a single man sees the group described as if all members are men

in spanish we have la real academia española identical to the french one and we also have the same gender issues than french both latin languages but as i read in the comments languages are alive they change at a much higher speed than any academia some people and press write for example ls directors o lxs directorxs instead of los directores traditional male term used in this case for a group of say  female directors and  male this way of writing is also lgbtaq friendly
what is termed political correctness is often just being a decent human to those around youwould that it were so but its not its come to mean in practice that one set of people wants to control what another set of people is allowed to say
unlike the genuinely worrying authoritarianism of theresa mays government which is backed up with political power censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger fair enough but doesnt the left want to gain political power is the message dont take us seriously were just a bunch of ineffectual lefties doing this for our own satisfaction or this is how we think the world should be work and well do everything in our power to make that happen the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening this confuses me because it obviously is happening and the rest of your article gives reasons why you agree it should be happening i dont really disagree with the author about the effect microaggressions have on people although i find the term alienating and pretentious it would be much better if nobody acted in a way that hurts people who only want to peacefully get on with their lives rightwingers who demand their right to free speech are almost always hypocrites who expect the right to never be challenged or have their consciences triggered precious snowflakes that they are but i dont find it as easy as the author does to come to the conclusion that its fine when my side does it but terrifying when their side does it and that therefore its nothing to worry about nor do i expect that to be an effective argument for a wider audience
id argue that in most cases offence and hurt are synonymous so just dont do it fuck that hurt and offence in this instance are synonymous if you feel offended or hurt by my comment then tough or do you want someone to legislate specifically to protect your sensibilities
microaggressions is a concept invented by an antiracist movement that finds itself in a country without everyday racism and therefore feels the need to invent some
by choosing women gays or black people to front their passiveagressive campaign of regressive speech they have found a weakness in the liberal lefts ability to strike back its undoubtedly true that this is tactical just as female barristers are often sought out to defend rapists what it exposes is a weakness in the opponents thinking it actually exposes their own prejudice if i am genuinely not prejudiced against black people i have no problem at all criticising obama equality doesnt mean freedom from criticism it means a level playing field what you allude to is actually disguised prejudice worthy of the pejorative political correctness for example the failure of the rotherham police to protect children from exploitation
to be called racist for opposing immigration is a badge of honour  of people have concerns over immigration 
im surprised your comment stayed on here till now actually
the people who bang on about political correctness gone mad just want to be absolved of any responsibility for the things they say and do people like abi wilkinson you mean
its religion if you disagree with me its because you are a bad person
many girls in the uk study stem subjects though it is often shown that they are more likely to do so when taught separately to boys it has often puzzled me why people fight political correctness over used and particularly overly used perjoratively term now when it is really a notion of considering offence harm and discrimination why fight that
you know the world is horrible place with horrible people and if mean words hurt and offend you one might as well live in the basement of ones parents home and stay there the world owes you nothing
many constructive criticisms of this group is not allowed yet they behave in a way that is diametrically opposed to the views of guardian readers and journalists
 backlash against politically correct language ignores the deeper oppression that unchecked microaggressions inflict on groups such as women and black people  micro aggression as a concept can just piss off see also privilege
but milo is a free speech martyr hes never incited people to violence or anything of the sort something which cannot be said of the liberal youth protesting against him and enabling troublemakers to hijack their protests
i get your point butpeople will believe what they want regardless for example its my opinion that britain is just as racist misogynistic etc as it was  years ago despite years of campaigning etc why because the truth is not important to most people facts are irrelevant people keep a world view that makes them feel safe amp justified white men need to have that sense of being the exceptional creators of the modern world because without that they have no identity black men need that sense of having had their futures stolen to justify their place in society etc truth what really happened and so on cant give groups the security they need as a tribe do they force themselves to live their own narratives and no amount of evidence protest discussion will change that of course i am speaking generallybut i guess we all see the world around us with very different eyes
why
except the very sentence you ed states that this is what the scientists found therefore they must have had evidence for such a conclusion after all thats how science works no thats what this writer thinks the study found a very different thing indeed especially as there is no evidence that she has read the original study here is the original study httpwwwnaturecomarticlessrep their findings are limited to finding that the difference in anxiety exists they do speculate that this might be to do with social stereotypes but thats based on a previous study into gender differences in anxiety around mathematical anxiety not on their own data
the left always want to controlspeech is free or it isntwho guards the guardians
it died when newage millennials and lefty liberals decided that they deserved to have the inalienable right to be offended and act upon it
people have the right of selfdefinition if they politely inform you why a certain term offends them then to continue to use it in reference to them is bad manners
so society should stand still because you find the changes confusing or upsetting look if youre really struggling to understand what to say or what not to say just operate by the principle that youre dealing with another human being so treat them with as much dignity and respect as youd want to be treated with yourself is that really so hard
common decency is only a subset of political correctness some subjects are tricky to discuss and debate without causing offence and there is a perception that political correctness is preventing those discussions taking place
words like scum are used on here all day long as the target is generally a tory it appears to be acceptable
youre really not being censored but you do feel very sorry for yourself are there not quite enough white males in positions of power and influence for your sensitivities
actually wouldnt it get easier with practice
beautifully accurate
good points i see tuition fees at the root of a lot of this when you turn students into customers then you have to start listening to their opinions when i was an undergrad full grant no fees it was made pretty clear by the academic staff that our status was knows only slightly more than fuck all the idea that we had something important to say would have been laughed at
action the process of doing something to achieve an aim cod if you say something with the aim of upsetting someone that is clearly an action hence for instance elements of the race relations act there is obviously room for discussion about how far this should be taken and this is exactly what the article is about but it cant be based on your false initial premise
thats all part of the fun though isnt it definitions and terminology that changes so often that those who wish to be can be permaoffended
im loving this there seems to be a growing trend for enterprising guardian readers to look up the actual research for themselves and too frequently they find that a journalist has misrepresented it
why must you agree with whatever they believe are you being held prisoner somewhere
there is already an example of this which is the n wordquite a few black people use it to describe themselves and each other in a reclaimed waybut the rest of us would never dream of using it in a media article or headline to describe all black people as we know that not all black people have reclaimed itwell that is exactly how i think of the q word yes it is more widely used in the usa eg i have seen it on films and read it on websites yes some british people use it but i have been openly gay in the uk for quite a long time and never heard it used in any positive way ever i was genuinely shocked when a few years back the first guardian article used it and i complained below and was told about how in some universities they use that term to describe all lbgt people etc it was news to me it is not used like that where i live never has been i dont want it to be
it doesnt mean that each and every use of the word racist or homophobe is therefore wrong i dont think anyone is really suggesting that its the kneejerk reaction and labelling of those who disagree with an individual position that is the problem you can get labelled a racist for thinking a particular police shooting was justified given the information at hand but it does not follow that you are actually a racist youre just guilty of wrongthink in their eyes and that is what they label such people
so really youre saying that you want people to stop saying things that you find offensive or annoying political correctness gone mad
the reference to darwin is a reference to survival of the fittest but after youve been given a head start when mostly white males insist on equality for all its safe in the knowledge that that means they will always been on top as for free speech i go back to the post child for free speech donald trump in florida the other day trump announced to the crowd that we are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do how to live or what to believe we are free and independent people and we will make our own choices however it seems that he and his supporters want to tell others what religion they can practice how they can express themselves what a woman can do with her body where a person can travel what employees a business can hire what the media can report how the judiciary may interpret the law what a persons gender should be and really this is the crux of this whole issue this is nothing to do with freedom it is the opposite it basically involves people like trump dictating to others how they should live their lives these the biggest threat to western democracy and freedom
but isnt that the point the author makes that offence is very different to harm but that is takes a good deal of analysis and thought to consider and make clear the difference and of course blatant opposition without discussion or thought could possibly be discriminatory not especially dangerous if only on comments boards as here as the author says but certainly if there is the weight of authority behind it
people do not hunt for offence we just call it out when we see it because we are so used to seeing it from people who ought to know better
does america really suffer from a free speech issue it has one of the most broad definitions and applications of free speech in the world i can concur that we have a pc culture in this country but im flummoxed about the us i have seen little evidence of people being suppressed there
surely the issue is that its ok to criticise in the original meaning of the word preferably an idea ie that all nonbelievers are infidels and that goes for many religions in the present and past but not make negative generalisations about or insult a group of people a person because of their colour race gender and so on its a mark of a civilised society that we all work hard to ameliorate the built in unfairness in society and language certainly impinges on that

how about not reading them if they offend how would you know if they offend without reading them
this was covered in the article
that is true because they didnt have any racist intention in their words that meaning was imported into their words and now those words offend people
no it doesnt really make much of a difference i would like everyone to behave with what i consider to be common decency but i dont believe i have a monopoly on defining what common decency is neither do i think that legislating to try to stop people bring inconsiderate to each other makes us any more free
satire is dead because the left is too easily offended and the right is too ridiculous to mock
id say those being violent at berkeley are fascists not antifascists as to the problem with introspection im divided on the one hand it does stop us challenging the right on the other without it the cure becomes worse than the disease and fails to cure anything
student activists do it seems have the right to stop fellow students listening to what they damn well please
while i agree with your comments about taking offence and free speech i think youre way off base on the hatred thing trump is all about channeling the anger and hatred of people who imagine themselves victims into power for himself the hatred is plain to see and the people he surrounds himself with like bannon and miller are some of the most disgustingly hateful people to hold positions of power since the nixon era supporting a man like that is in itself an act of hatred
i generally find it a good idea to read a variety of news sources anyway irrespective of whats happened to the writing in the guardian there is not a single outlet in existence that doesnt apply an angle to any given story breitbart and spectator included for a balanced view its better to read across the spectrum

i enjoyed reading that thanks as i understand it and i did look up wikipedia to check my own recollection political correctness in its current usage began as a satirical comparison between late th century attempts mainly in american universities to suppress opinions its proponents regarded as reactionary and dogmatic application of stalinist doctrine in mid century ussr in my experience the phrase has now become an epithet in the mouths of the reactionary used to resist attempts by others to be kinder and more inclusive im certain that the irony of this reversal of usage would be lost on most of its users although im sure that some understand it only too well
the opposite of political correctness isnt offensiveness but candour dont listen to katie hopkins thats a soft target try hitchens or voltaire should probably issue a trigger warning for candide though
it invites people to define themselves by their victim group and this can lead to seeing all of lifes problems in those terms it sets up enemies in other identified groups and war is waged over microagressions many of which are misinterpreted or over stated your point is sound one which i live with almost everyday when i first moved here to brussels six years ago i was told by grown middleaged men who were born and raised in this city to not look the young local moroccan men in the eye for too long because it will make them angry and it could lead to a fistfight i learned over the years that they were right looking a millisecond too long directly into the eyes of many of the young males in this one minority group is apparently a challenge a threat a micoaggression in their eyes thatll quickly turn into a macroaggression when you are physically attacked ive personally had to deal with this a few times luckily it was one on one
i dont think i have read or heard anyone say that all muslims are terrorists
what about the offensive nature of accusations of complicity in the slave trade to all white people of today or all the other constant accusations made against straight white men or lecturing people with some absurd and misguided sense of having the right and authority to do so about what words they may and may not use the raised finger of preachy political correctness is offensive and has done much to provoke the current turnings of the tides
most people should however agree that the calling of refugees cockroaches that need stamping out by gunboats as something completely unacceptable this is not just unacceptable it is rightly illegal because it is incitement to murder
its a reaction to it plenty of white males in wisconsin and detroit getting fed up of being told they had privilege even though they were unemployed and poor identity politics casts the straight white male as the enemy so dont be surprised when they vote for the nonidentity politics candidate
you are right in that the context is vitally important as it is in most things but at the same time actions have consequences so you may feel that you are being oppressed because you feel you can no longer express yourself or use certain words but you arent just as you are entitled to say what you like others are entitled to judge you for it and inform you of that judgement just as a business or club may decide that you present the wrong image for them and let you go most contracts would have a dont embarrass the company clause for expressing yourself you havent been oppressed youve just suffered the consequences of your actions
and the conventions are often ridiculous cf benedict cumberbatch being attacked for saying coloured people instead of people of colour
bit sexist of you surely dont you mean alpha males and alpha females why are the females limited to the role of being sympathisers
did they actually do anything to distinguish between the two things a genuine lack of ability and it all being the fault of society
the moderator does not allow much offence against the left its against community guidelines
exactly the point is did cumberbatch face any legal consequences for his words no he just got a bit of a bashing on twitter thats just society if you say something some people dont like they will think youre horrible and tell you about it i think its only the people who expect everyone to like them all the time who take issue with political correctness
i pointed out in an earlier comment that there is a law on hate speech in the uk  a person is guilty of an offence if with intent to cause a person harassment alarm or distress he a uses threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour or b displays any writing sign or other visible representation which is threatening abusive or insulting thereby causing that or another person harassment alarm or distress i live in the netherlands which also has a law on hate speech it was successfully applied when geert wilders was prosecuted for inciting hatred against a minority group of dutch citizensthe problem is of course that the state does simply not have the ability to prosecute everybody who falls foul of the law the end of the day it will come down to members of society itself to put enough pressure on their fellowcitizens to make hate speech unacceptable as with drunkdriving which was quite the norm when i was young peoples views as to what is acceptable behaviour can be changed but never completely
it goes further than that though it goes to banning certain newspapers and having the police trawl the internet for offensive thoughts it is v dangerous and shouldnt be encouraged if you have a problem with what someone is saying take it up with them argue it out just dont try to ban them from saying whatever they want to say
wish i was  maybe i could do that
snowflake theyll never make that politically incorrect
great post completely agree i wonder if it will be the guardian pick
religiouslybased political parties must never be allowed and this has nothing to do with free speech once you give priests the right to instruct their flock how to vote on pain of eternal damnation you have kissed goodbye to democracy
bigotry is pretty easy to spot prejudicial statements and beliefs applied to broad and diverse demographic groups based on narrow and limited experience are bigotry that aside if calling someone a bigot is a problem then that would suggest that i shouldnt call a spade a spade which is essentially just another censorious opinion but more importantly why do people allow themselves to be cowed into silence by being called a bigot if they think their opinion is factually accurate why dont they stand up and defend it people who opposed the church or the divine right of kings were subject to far worse than a touch of public shaming and they stood by their controversial opinions if they share that sort of conviction in their beliefs surely theyd stand up for them the truth will out and if you genuinely believe something something as feeble and pathetic as being called a bigot wont shut your mouth for a moment
the backlash against this freedom to be offended has been ongoing for decades now and yet those eagerly seeking out ways to choose to be offended continues as strong as ever as this cifer ends her piece just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should but will those hunting for offense often only imagined ever learn
httpwwwthecollegefixcompostwhich ironically permits of no legitimate dissentseems you have a pointuniversity students trying to noplatform the dalai lama on the grounds that their cultural sensitivities are offended
of course but whos writing the list of things which are not for discussion
most of the protesters were nonviolent and were exercising their constitutional right legitimately tarring everyone with the same brush is disingenuous
you clearly havent got the message islamophobia has been declared to be a real thing but noone has invented the term christianophobe so clearly it cannot exist
women apparently
but you cant say something is absolute and then provide caveats i agree that those caveats should be in place but you cant say you cannot have partial free speech when you have just established that partial free speech is precisely what we do have ultimately the debate isnt about censorship its about civility its about understanding the feelings and views of others and taking those into account when we determine the language that we use language is fluid and has changed to accommodate other people and to cause less offence throughout history it hasnt required censorship or authoritarianism to do so its a moral choice not a legal one and making the debate entirely about censorship vs free speech ignores that and makes the conversation too polarised to make any meaningful headway
whereas the other list includes things like oscarssowhite the gender pay gap black lives matter uk the word cis disabled film roles not being played by disabled actors etc
perhaps thats because thatd the group being censored most ive often been told my opinion is worthless due to my race and gender in fact theres a word people have started throwing around mansplaining which exists to invalidate an opinion based on genitalia
i wanna know whos still reading maps in 
indeed ive long seen many modern liberals as actual backdoor social conservatives they still want to control peoples speech beliefs what they do in the bedroom etc just with slightly different motives and different targets youve defined of whole chunk of people there brilliantly bravo
but what if those opinions actually are racisthomophobicsexist then criticise and argue against them handing someone the power to suppress any speech they think is offensive simply gives them carte blanche to run amok with their own political prejudices its the same reason the police arent free to just imprison anyone theyre really sure is guilty of a crime nobody is omniscient nor free from bias prejudice and selfinterest you cannot simply impose a utopia by banning anything that doesnt fit into it totalitarian states the world over have tried that often with the best of intentions and look what happens an escalating cycle of repression as people refuse to fit into the mould they are ordered to follow and perversion of the utopian principles to suit the interests of whoever controls the levers of power
speech is free but not free from criticism or analysis thats the liberal position
replace the phrase political correctness with common decency whod argue against that pc has become a handy phrase employed by those who derive pleasure from causing offence for its own sake against anything they dislike
for not offending muslims i must agree with whatever they believe and not to criticize any of their behaviours otherwise i am a racist muslim isnt a race and a hater
hate speech is a legal and social construct the content of which will vary from one environment to another it is not an absolute that can be defined clearly attempts to criminalise or sanction speech by designating it as hate speech is a bad idea im on the side of the famous e attributed loosely to voltaire i wholly disapprove of what you say and will defend to the death your right to say it
fuck them tom robinson power in the darkness
or when we decisde whats offensive and whats not it means we can decide what people can and cannot say even more
there is a simplier rubrick for this as currently as the comments show the line seems fairly knotty  is what you are saying causing a persistant violence to a group of people or engaging with an ongoing violence against a group of people intent are you saying something to provoke a negative reaction bully or harass a group of people or are you trying to make a legimate point  is the pushback on what you say engaging with what you saying or trying ot silence it not absolute but a start
get chilled doesnt bother me if you feel that way
that would depend on the quality of the wanking i would think
i think you mean arse and arsesses
i dig
how long until the only application of the feminine nouns and pronouns will be in respect of ships cars washing machines and other insentient serving machines before you ask the local washing machine repair guy refers to his patients as she
and isnt twee and warm ample grounds for condemnation do we really want to be part of some inane reconstructed brady bunch grinning aimlessly from behind their shiny white picket fence
if you are trying to build camaraderie why use a divisive term
no im asking you what you mean by guy i dont care who users it for what reason only that they should be able to so free from the diktat of pettyorwellian control freaks
i dont mean it to be in any way disrespectful but its not what you intend its how youre listened to incorrect if you misinterpret what i am saying and be offended by it then that is your problem not mine i am not responsible for your understanding
personally id probably use you shower of twats insulting and offending everyone thats real equality at play
i think youre lost youre looking for the s youre welcome
its not what you intend its how youre listened to thats crap if i say something completely innocuous and you get all snitty about it then thats you not me
surely calling people gents is ok because it could also mean gentlewomen speaking of gentlemen in the context of an upstandingpoliteconsiderate man is there a female equivalent word
the origin of duck as a term of endearment is not derived from the female bird but from ducas a term of respect related to the word duke the word hen as a term of endearment is used for women hin or hinny is used in the north east and is derived from honey
no but shes dismissing the need not to alienate people who wont necessarily automatically and naturally agree with youfeminisms going nowhere as long as it only thinks it needs to preach to the choir
humor bypass searching for headpats from scary feminists
i use guys when addressing a group of females in a casual setting
you irk too easily
very well said
for american readers i think its fair to point out the to british english ears folks doesnt sound warm and informal it sounds patronising and consciously archaic nostalgic the only time is used regularly is in old folks home meaning residential or nursing care home with inferences you can guess at otherwise it is synonymous with bumpkin
everyone works for me but guys is better
disappearance via selfclacker entry i think youve just solved the problem of overpopulation bravo
i wouldnt even talk to you in work because you sound like an objectionable person so my my form of address for a group of people you were included in would be you people plus that one
which considering the delicacy and sensitivity of a gentlemans clockweights is the wrong exhortation to courage andor resilience we should encourage a quailing individual to grow a vagina upon taking a hammering it becomes resilient even accommodating even a glancing flick on a pair of balls makes the recipient curl up like a worm on a hook
invert it ill greet you amp your mixedsex group with hi ladies happy about that if yes then problem solved if no then maybe you might wish to ponder why amp the deeper implications btw tis pointless saying god forbid fictitious entities cant really do too much of anything
true their tiramisu is delicious though dammit
wow why didnt you just say it was bothering instead of that talking about being a lady
i spend a good deal of time trying to give offense i give freely without charge as a matter of public service
cats is soooooo s
why would comrades piss right wing people offits surely a more fitting quip to use to have a dig at left wing loons
really interesting to look at how this discussion is developing everyone agreeing the term is fine is left alone the only two poster raising the other point of view have at least four or five objecting comments underneath rather than replying to them all let me restate the other side to this debateguys is not a gender neutral term because it would not make sense if applied to a specifically female group im sorry if not surprised that the first example that came to my mind allowed repliers to attack the example and not the argument how about there are loads of guys in the ladies toilets most guys would prefer to give birth at home im not disputing that this word is used by both men and women to refer to both men and women i do it myself i am also not as i said suggesting we ban words but we should use them with understanding
antiintellectual and totalitarian argument how has humanity entered such an inane era
some suggestions for alternative to guys championsyallfriends these will suitably piss people off and best of all no one can claim to be offended
i went to the opera house and checked my privilege when i went back for it they wouldnt return it cos id lost my ticket memo to self keep privilege in pocket along with pecker
just call everyone fellow comrade of the united socialist workers front that should stave off any difficulties
very very very true
god forbid if these people getting offended speak a language with grammatical gender can you imagine the uproar tell them that in spanish tampon is masculine el tampón watch their heads explode
everyone cringed at chaps and chapess even back then but he didnt mind and nor did they
yes because thats exactly what she said oh wait its not
isnt wanker a rather outstanding term in a manner of speaking
also regionally duckhen
my greeting of choice is hello you magnificent bastards
yeah smash the patriarchy killallmen killallwhitemen how to win friends and influence people by madchinchillalady
you got it babe
i had a boss who used it sincerely in weekly team meetings hello folk he began in a cheery voice bless he was trying hard but managed to come up with something that nobody liked
its both intersectionality
you literally could not give a dam not physically anyway you could technically transfer ownership of one
its not uncommon for men to address groups of men as ladies just as a personal opinion people who take offense at things like this have too much time on their hands and should indulge their controlling and humorless behavior in private with other consenting like minded guys
whats equally interesting is that guys of both genders may be encouraged to grow a pair of balls
now then now then
guys i thought you were all cats cool
bitch
as a feminist i think we need to choose our battles carefully to ensure we pursue gender equality but not at the expense of alienating men and the broader public hahahahahahaha that would definitely have historically worked out just great for women and got lots done oppressed groups must of course take care not to alienate their oppressors how can they expect to challenge oppression otherwise i cant be bothered challenging every collective use of guys and dont care that much but its not really gender nonspecific when it only gets used that way for mixed groups otherwise it refers to men
in ireland lads is used in much the same way many in the uk use guys its very confusing
where did i say that i do
ah no im just sleepy and not picking up on it apologies
there is no real generic word in spanish the closest would be gente and you will never write amigos in a professional setting in a spanish business environment writing hola as an email greeting is more than enough
i do not like the term guy bloke is the term in my neck of the woods so you guys can fawke off
nowadays ladies has been going on for a few years now whether in the forces or on the rugby field the first time i remember it being used to me and some other people it was at school a bogstandard comprehensive in the mids
so what men and women say the boys all the time when referring to men its not offensive
do you mean guy is ambiguous and might refer to males alone or to males and females combined but never to females alone and if so why do you think that is
and honestly if someone is to be offended that person is not someone i would like to spend time with wow
my wife is a teacher in the uk and refers to her class collectively as guys as do all the other teachers in the school we refer to our children as guys girlboy are you saying her opinion doesnt count the opinion of her female coworkers doesnt count they are wrong and you are right what kind of trip are you on
many english speakers have never really come to terms with youyou they both seem singular to some hence the perceived need for yous yousall yaall yous guys and you guys the last though not appreciated by all is probably preferred in professional settings increasing the frequency with which the word guys is used as for its use in salutations one could always borrow from mr grace with a cheery good morning everybody thus and entirely fooling any idiots one will be taken for an edwardian rather than a mysoginist
i cam think of three of my friends who use it completely sincerely
guys and dolls theyre just a bunch of crazy guys and dolls yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
all communication is evil my thoughts are with you
bit personal dont you think maybe things that matter to you would make other people roll their eyes
the gatekeepers should restrict their feeble and febrile attempts at bondage to their own persons
oh dear the americans are still awake note to self turn of irony until am
surely guys for a mixed group is just an abbreviation and balance can be regained by a return to the full phrase guys and dolls
fuck is my go to even for my first comment
as someone said yesterday how can there be so many bad things happening in the world when weve spent a decade constantly refining and policing our language well quite
i dont like it do you want to call me a wanker in person i mean not from behind your keyboard
i have indeed been known to greet male colleagues with a cheery morning girls i do hope they werent offended as in i dont give a flying one
how about ello peeps in a caricature greek accent
you forget heres your bill guys yes a couple of pizzas and a small bowl of olives really does come to that much guys
im going to continue to use the greeting hey guys to my group of female friends and male friends and friendly colleagues and honestly if someone is to be offended that person is not someone i would like to spend time with god forbid if these people getting offended speak a language with grammatical gender can you imagine the uproar
or run a chain saw through its supporting structure preferably
what are you really angry about though
but then i did what all white men should do regularly i checked my privilege sarcasm i hope in spanish if there are males and females present then you refer to them all as amigos
that question rather depends on whether your third use of guy is genderspecific or not
i find the need to discriminate by gender is always odd i like guys being used for all and i like girls or ladies used in the same way its kinda funny and sort of inclusive in mixed gender groups i hate forms that ask your gender when there is no need at all for them to know i like comrades too mainly because it really pisses right wing people off lol
i dont think you need to be a fully signed up member of mascmasc to find referring to each other as gurl just dumb
just doing my part
its not important to you you mean
all communication is evil 
hed be unlucky not to chap and chapess are more than slightly naff but i think you could get away with them without being subject to imprisonment with hard labour
this just in people could take offence when you say anything next up breaking news the sun is hot
in germany the common slang collective equivalent to our guys is madels which really means girls but no one takes offence
those believing guys has not transitioned to gender nonbinary are overlooking its etymology thats it lads im outta here
if you dont understand the power that words have i feel sorry for you
youve solved the problem and deserve the internets appreciation
try going to any restaurant owned by jamie oliver i think it must be in their contract hi guys how are we this eveningthis table okay with you guyswhere are you guys fromcan i get you guys a drinkguys are you ready to order no but im ready to punch you
perhaps if he wasnt just posturing hed have had the balls to say where he lives
tell you what dont use fauxchummy words like guys or people as greetings at all theyre crass us imports fit for use neither with women or men and remind me of david brent and an office manager i knew and despised who would pepper her witless conversation with frequent imprecations to you guys she also referred to orange juice as oj therell be a corner of hell reserved for her
guys is offensive to all mature brits regardless of gender as it suggests the imperialistic takeover by the us which wont happen unless brexit wins
agree its actually rather chillingwe cant control how we are listened to and we cant possibly edit our linguistic output on that basis youd end up saying nothing at all
its better than hello darls which an editor of mine used to greet me with all the time one day i said fine how are they hanging he never said it again
shoomer aha i see you have stumbled upon schopenhauers th strategem
your replies skirt the essence of my points rather than engaging it eg youve argued that in the case of the singular they them  amp theirs youre simply yielding to a faitaccompli not promoting one the facts say otherwise when you _tell_ pupils that the prevailing usage is not merely prevalent but also correct usage there are certainly other cases in which you positively oppose a strong or even prevalent trend informing your students or clients that x while prevalent is neither correct nor good english usage and ought to be avoidedif cares about the impression he makes on others through his use of english the truth though you try not to face it is that you champion the singular they as socially positive and progressivethus a thing to be defended from criticism and promoted among those who are not already among its users thus youre an active advocate of this usage not just a disinterested observer of practices as for you this constitutes grammar conviction id have more respect for your views if you owned that conviction in a straightforward manner
just because some are ignorant it doesnt mean everyone else is
it not meant literally as a chair a chair can also mean the highest officer of an organized group and it has done for hundreds of years the royal navy had a chair on every ship going back to the th century get a grip mate and stop with the personal insults it just makes you look stupid
ah troll the go to word when ones argument fails you cant win so you attempt to shout them down by calling them a troll how would you have have won this argument a few years ago when the bastardisation of the word wasnt in popular use
shoomer chairperson or no its still ridiculous to call the person occupying the chair as the actual chair and by the way you are a nasty troll who should get out more
you are confusing three things here accepted usage them as a singular pronoun if gender is unknown spelling and punctuation mistakes misuse of the apostrophe confusion of theirtheretheyre and limited vocabulary i suppose it is possible that in time the apostrophe will fall out of use or that all homonyms will morph into the same spelling but that is not about to happen now it is still a mistake is still corrected by teachers in the classroom an copy editors in the publishing houses social media has meant we see rather more writing from poorlyeducated strangers than would have been true in the past but that does not actually mean that standards are dropping as to your dislike of awesome yes it is a bit annoying but it is very odd that you seem to believe there was ever a time when similar words were not in popular use
the question is why do we need gender neutral language in the first place
bollocks chairman never became chairperson thats just bullshit what happened is chairman can also be chairwomen if you have a problem with that then you have something wrong with you
i dont know if its a regional thing but ive always used they for singular unknown gender its never been an issue if someone has a problem with it whoever they are its their problem
i would say that the meaning here is crystal clear and there has been no breach of any grammatical rule technically it is indeed physically impossible for a country in the geographical sense to attend anything but not in the sense of representatives of a nation north korea is not participating in the european championships does that sound wrong to you it doesnt to me anyway i am quite sure i could find some errors here if i looked for them but for your point to be made you would need to demonstrate that no errors were ever made in newspapers in the past
from the guardian panama papers source breaks silence more than  countries are due to attend the london summit on thursday do you think forty countries shall be in attendance at the london meeting on thursday the sentence above tells us theyre due to attend the writer failed to consider the distinction between forty countries and representatives of forty countries the careless use of language degrades both our language and our capacity to think clearly the latter is required to make fine distinctions in reasoning without that capacity we make more mistakes and more serious mistakes
lorraine berry must be a terribly sequestered middle class person if she hasnt noticed how frequent the pronoun they is in normal workingclass speech resolving the gendered reference issue in an unselfconscious way for many speakers of the language but having an ungendered neutral pronoun for referring to male and female persons doesnt solve the sexism issue anyway finns and turks have probably had such pronouns for many centuries but neither society has been particularly genderequal during that time while the finns are now maybe as equal as other western societies or slightly more so than most finland like the other nordic countries still has sexism unequal pay in spite of laws against this sexist advertising glass ceilings women doing more housework and childcare etc and turkey ungendered pronoun or not could hardly be held up as a model of gender equality
i do not accept at all that english is becoming debased yes thats obvious from your comments if your evidence for this is simply the use of them as a singular pronoun in some circumstances then that is pretty poor evidence no its actually rather good evidence of the declineeven if it were the sole example or the sole kind of example but it isnt theres also the growing loss of a correct use of your and youre theres a more general blurring of oncefine distinctions between concepts and the loss of useful words power or significance by their overuse or their sloppy imprecise use theres a very significant rise in the use of theres followed by a plural form theres too many theres more and more theres all kinds theres these or those an example is found often used in this paper including one on its websites front page earlier today not in a ed statementof anothes misuse but rather of the papers writers own use all manner of quantatative terms and uses are falling into lazy abusemainly through plain ignorance people hear all around them ignorant usage and they repeat it without reflefction the power of superlatives or terms which should be used to indicate rare occurramces are used for banal descriptions awesome incredibleour candidate is incredible this next news story is incredible if language wasnt the main repository of cultural riches if it didnt constitute the foundation of our thinking our reasoning capacity these matters should be less important but with the degradation of the language comes a generalized degradation in our ability to discuss issues reasonably and effectively a degradation in our basic capacity to think straight about things in general if these were the price of some stupendous improvement in societys general welfare that would be one thing but for these failings to have no return no compensating feature for them to be simply the product of general ignorance through slovenly laziness is a shame and a disgrace i doubt youve read postmans technopoloy i dare you to read it
i do not accept at all that english is becoming debased if your evidence for this is simply the use of them as a singular pronoun in some circumstances then that is pretty poor evidence i personally think that it is an improvement on the previous options and obviously i am not alone as it has become accepted usage there were no doubt people who got upset about the second person singular disappearing from use do you think that was symptomatic of the same decline in standards if so that decline kicked in well before your teachers were trained
grammar is tory really
the genderless pronoun is it
our shared language our political order and our common cultural heritage have all suffered immensely profoundly from a combination of factors a public which treats them with indifference with lazy carelessness and with malign neglect as in supposing their being simply what may always be taken for grantedlifes trivial background scenery is one of the biggest factors in this continuing social abdication of responsibility these trends are as profoundly related as they are important see for detailed treatment postman  technopoly the surrender of culture to technology knopfvintage books random house ny
change the language you use to talk about something you change the way you think about it and the way you see it thats the basic idea behind gender neutral pronouns reading some of the comments below just confirms why it is still necessary
again i feel that you are not really reading my comment obviously the language can and does change that is very much my point although whether or not it can be changed is another matter my point was that you personally cannot change it really arent there more useful things to vent so much energy on
try rereading carefully what youve written here what i really dont understand is how you can compare a life threatening situation ie the misuse of grammar with something minor ie wandering aimlessly amongst traffic twice in your post above you wrote
speaking of not reading attentively youve used some form of the word rebuke four times here while i never once mentioned anything about a rebuke this goes far to explain our differing world views i explained that adults showed concern for interest in a child when they took the trouble to correct a childs misspoken grammar my parents always corrected my grammar but never once rebuked me for a grammatical mistake now this is rebuke look here mister before you charge me to take the mote from my eye you should take care to remove the beam from yours i can and i do read and write more carefully and with more understanding than youve shown in this exchange for example people in a nonteaching environment who publicly current sic others grammar are incredibly rude and ought to be ashamed of themselves people in a teaching environment need to consider whether it is wise to publicly current others and this is rebuke go peddle your fucking papers you pisspoor reader
which is my point use a genderfree word and the sexism is still there its the people at fault not the language
belongs in the fucking looney bin whats next this is orwellian newspeak coming to life sorry that you cant decide what gender you are but thats not my problem perhaps try flipping a coin
sorry for misjudging your tone always a danger in written comments and thank you for introducing me to spivak pronouns very interesting thank you too for explaining the judge problem i know a lot of other people who would also use judges in this situation i find it easier perhaps to imagine a genderless judge than some other professions thanks to distinctive clothing on their part and a poor visual imagination on mine but i understand your point would spivak pronouns not face exactly the same criticism
typical guardian rant i will continue to use male genetic pronoun and i will resist all forms of feminist rebellion against mankind children have already been turned against their fathers and now feminist fundamentalists want to revise the english language even the word woman is dominated by man making up most of the word what are these nut jobs going to do next remove the word man from their own kind ha ha ha and women want equal pay the article is absurd
did you actually read what i wrote did you see the word publicly did you see the word people i was taking a more general approach or didnt you realise that i wasnt concentrating on teachers i accept that when trying to convey information the writer needs to take into account their audience so i apologise for not clarifying that i was not specifically referring to a teaching scenario however teachers do need to be aware of the dangers of publicly rebuking the mistakes of their students what is the point of good grammar when you cant comprehend the words in front of you how did you move from me writing about publicly rebuking someones grammar to one of neglect what i really dont understand is how you can compare a life threatening situation ie the misuse of grammar with something minor ie wandering aimlessly amongst traffic i will now rephrase my original post people in a nonteaching environment who publicly current others grammar are incredibly rude and ought to be ashamed of themselves people in a teaching environment need to consider whether it is wise to publicly current others nb at no point in this post or the previous post have i said mistakes should be ignored its actually a matter of judgement as to when if and how mistakes should be pointed out ps i do get publicly rebuked for my crap sense of humour but i dont care pps if you spot any grammatical errors in my writing above please feel free to publicly rebuke me i wont be offended
first world problems
one is not convinced that heshe in english is more of an isssue than the problems one encounters with the third person in french or spanish particularly when one has to use the third person plural in spanish at least on this side of the atlantic is now being forced into personal pronouns to show that one is pc
thats unfortunate 
based on my actual experience when some people discover the fire fighter police officer pilot parent prison governor etc etc is a woman they see it as an opportunity to mock and attempt to undermine the authority of the person concerned
gender neutral speech is a lot easier in finnish though
the author has clearly never read jane austen why would they
im finnish and when speaking english i always have to make a conscious effort to think about a persons gender when talking about himher ive grown up using genderneutral personal pronouns and it still feels a bit unnatural and weird to force yourself to select one or the other im not sure whether this makes me less sexist but at least it makes it a bit easier to think about people without thinking about their gender
thats clearly silly but what about starting to call jane jones mrs john smith when she marries john smith does that really happen in the englishspeaking world profoundly medieval
does hen really sound worse than han or hon
article titles are written by subeditors they very often dont actually reflect the options of the author and in this case im far from certain the author would agree that they is the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in english
which is why nobody is suggesting stopping using he or she except where the gender is immaterial or unknown and therefore forcing a male gender on to it is inaccurate the doctor thinks they are cleverer than youjohn thinks he is cleverer than you not that complicated
in situations like where is your sister they have gone to the shop it just glares out of me it glares out of you for good reason this is a sentence nobody certainly no native speaker would ever say as its pretty damned obvious sister requires she a gender neutral pronoun is only ever needed in cases when the gender of the person in question is not known or unclear people get along fine in english treating you as both singular and plural and so they do with they which has been established as a singular pronoun for about  years give or take
in much of hibernoenglish and some english dialects yous is already fixed in cork however ye is used as the plural in lancashire derbyshire and much of yorkshire tha and thee is still frequently upon the lips
i would if i know its my mother if i dont id say they i thought everyone was agreed on that
and some use they get over it
i think you should rule out cultural generalizations about a language spoken by  million speakers from tierra del fuego to tijuana and from there to aragón there is no such thing as a hispanic or spanish culture much in the same way there is no such thing as an anglophone culture for example you can tell me how say lagos belfast tasmania and singapore also share a culture
i think you should revise your knowledge of english if you mean it in the romance languages likespanish you might be right los padres los hijos but it also works the other way around if we see say giraffes and snakes well use the femenine for them regardless of the beasts themselves being sexually male or female las girafas las serpientes
i detect irony
squaaaaad tellthe jokeich wunsch schau und tottenheimer ja
im beginning to feel a bit sorry for you now go on have a last word i imagine its quite important to you i promise i wont respond make it a goodun champ
oh yes we get it in your heart you know youre funny
man you really dont like letting it go do you thanks for demonstrating at such length too what you mean by utterly humourless and pofaced i think we get it now
i think you need to stop agonising about it all
benmoreassynt thecheesewrangler and the_blind_beggar have already very patiently pointed out the deficiencies viz a viz your skit the last word from thecheesewrangler was that she was bored by my post containing too many words presumably long ones in particular benmoreassynt on having the jocular nature of my post pointed out to himher simply replied no its you this is not something most neutral observers would describe as patientyou yourself were invited to explain what my point was and conspicuously failed to do so opting to go for the ad hom instead i was in the princess bride think i know more about jokes than you do i think that given the utterly humourless and pofaced contributions you have made to the thread that frankly we can discount your opinion of your being an expert on funniness largely it must be said because you claim to be an expert on it which is pretty much the equivalent of the monty python army officer who begins by announcing now noone likes a laugh more than me except for my wife and some of her friends oh yes and captain johnson to put it another way every time from now that i read anything you post i will be hearing it in the voice of lieutenant haulk httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgeqpjfrgcy
teachers have a duty to correct their students mistakes other responsible adults used to commonly correct childrens grammatical errors this was no more considered rude of them than if theyd intervened to prevent a childs wandering aimlessly in automible traffic to leave the child in the traffic would have been considered negligenteven worse than rude to leave a childs grammar mistake uncorrected is also neglect it should have been thought very rude not to correct a child but such are the stupid times in which we live that today one has to explain these things which ought to be obvious ignorant people who insist on remaining ignorant ought to be ashamed of themselves
excellent post
god you are do politically correct and moving of topic ciao
well it is quite obvious that they can also be used in the singular try any some every and no combinations and see whether it works in all of them sometimes it does sometimes it doesnt just like they
picador does not know what schizophrenia is
why not a pilot lands a plane in a crosswind at what angle should the plane be pointed no need for a pronoun at all
well as i said they is acceptable but imo clearly inferior neither shakespeare nor coleridge were writing formal documents or texts its only this obsession with gender which is causing any kind of dobulethink with he whereas it will always be there when we are mixing singular and plural clearly a misunderstanding of how many people are being referenced is worse than worrying about the hypothetical gender of a nonexistent placeholder person
lol
i told yall everything i know works for me as an object
think its good i was told i couldnt do this writing uni essays in the s as it wasinelegant apparently she is a much more elegant solution
its widely used definitely but that doesnt mean that people can stop using she or he in all contexts even if they try im in favour of the idea but its analagous to asking people to replace words like the or at not practically possible
the word man in english has always meant human ungendered hence mankind meaning humankind also ungendered the gendered words were werman for male human and wifman for female human as english evolved females kept their gendered noun wifman becoming woman but males lost theirs becoming just man the words man and mankind have therefore always included not excluded females the word womankind includes females and excludes males there is no equivalent english word that includes males and excludes females
i guess the news is that the use of they while acceptable in certain circumstances has been adopted by a bandwagon which seeks to eliminate any reference to gender in the language on theoretical genderequality grounds hence the title they the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in english which suggests that it is the language which is sexist in itself rather than certain individuals who use it which would make all speakers of most other languages both men and women rampant sexists
whilst the  edition of fowlers modern english usage disliked the practice of using they their and them as singular pronouns the  states that traditional grammarians aside such constructions are hardly noticed any more and not widely felt to lie in a prohibited zonepand that they been used as singular since at least the th century they note evidence of they being used as a singular from the th century onwards and cite usages from fielding  chesterfield  whewell  and ruskin  all cited in the oed so why this is news is peculiar
how about it our society rejects natural law and christian understanding of what the human person is reducing us to mere animals a dog cow or rabbit can be referred to as an it rather than he or she then theres that great movie line it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
re the example the feminist was arguing with the chauvinist because he was daft yes it is ambiguous however so is the feminist was arguing with the chauvinist because they were daft
why should the intention be discriminatory and not informative that say more about the speaker than the language itself
i stand corrected
someone as a word is singular but it refers to a multitude for example someone on this bus has farted refers to thirty possible farters
police officers fire fighters nurses parent etc etc the gender is usually not relevant unless of course the user intends to be discriminatory
wheres the teacher they are in the staffroom correct english
comments like this really blow my mind you are so ignorant that you were unaware of the centuriesold fact that they can be singular and you are so confident in your ignorance that you plainly didnt bother to read even a single sentence of the article before commenting on it what is it about grammar that draws such tiresome ignoramuses out of the woodwork like this
the question is whether using it in this way constitutes an error or not many of out grammar rules are victorian inventions and as a living language common usage often rums ahead of the textbooks so if the primary purpose of language is to communicate then as long as the meaning is clear then its fine with me
indeed last night i finished reading un lun dun by china miéville a book with a female lead character presumably i shouldnt have been able to enjoy it due to my possession of testicles
only dont call me surely
what a curious mind you have no they are just using they as many have for many years so my mind they are being reasonable as i dont know the gender of beingpensive it seems reasonable to use they if i knew their gender i would of course use she or he
then thou shouldst commence a great campaign for their reestablishmentyour comment is a good example of linguistic development not always being in the best interests of clarity
the thing with a word such as anyone is that it is itself singular because of the one part but refers to multiple people eg anyone with a british passport refers to about  people it is therefore correct to say anyone is singular they will plural because anyone refers to people in the plural
 dont waste so much anger on something that you cannot change dont presume to know what can and cannot be changed in contemporary english grammarespecially when at the same time you refer to what you call correct merely because it happens to be prevalent at this time
in the informal speech of native english speaker in american at least they their them has always been used in instances of either groups the plural or in the case of an unknown individual singular ie i found this lost item i wonder if they will ever come back for it then once the individual is a known subject the personal pronouns are used personally it seems to use a term for a unknown to identify a known as an insult to that known subject which is also the same object i raise when using it to identify someone personally in these situations of doubt of proper pronoun usage i either operate in one of two ways if the individuals name is known to me i use the name in place of pronouns when referencing that specific individual or i just omit pronouns completely ex of both have a good day andromeda or enjoy your day
you is the second person plural along with ye thou and thee are the second person singular
get rid of them all i find the word mother particularly insulting
what a curious mind you have
using they their them etc when referring to one person is simply a shortcut way of saying he or she him or her his or hers etc native english speakers use these pronouns all the time without realising its only when this is specifically pointed out that they are really surprised and often vigourously deny it saying its not grammatical often having absolutely no notion of grammar in the first place the point about the article is that the writer is proposing a totally genderless pronoun that doesnt mean he or she but simply the person i think this is basically a good idea as it gets rid of the ambiguity and clumsiness of sentences like a i went to see the doctor about it boh what did he say a it was a she actually but i dont think they and related pronouns are the right ones to adopt as these pronouns are specifically plural in other contexts and we cant end up saying things like they is coming tomorrow as a teacher or english as a foreign language i know firsthand how the singular use of they in english is very perplexing to language learners who have been drilled into learning the third person singular pronouns he she and it and agreement with the verb then suddenly up bobs they in conversation or written articles referring to a singular person and the learner is confused so time is spent explaining why and how these pronouns are used and also advising the learner not to use them themselves yes themselves
you would be incredibly rude in this example it is preferable if one keeps things impersonal referring instead to a person of indeterminate characteristics and relation to anyone spoken to captured so beautifully be the word one
why
some people resort to putting everything in the nominative case in german
i dont want to be stubborn but she isnt easy on my eye either and how do you do it with hisher as a rule of thumb anything that contains a slash im not going partial to
why cant girls relate to male characters unless their genitals are explicitly part of the narrative in fairness i havent seen peppa pig how is this even an issue
dont you mean yous as in look out yous as a warning etc
thanks i didnt know about that ill look it up
haha no im not a teacher i totally agree it is important to know who is teaching your kids however im more interested in their approach to teaching discipline creativity etc than their gender ethnicity or age the trouble is that the latter are usually easy to find out and the interesting things more difficult what im worried about is the assumptions we tend to make about people so if i know my children have an older teacher am i going to think theyll be less active i think were probably better meeting people without making assumptions first and if gender neutral pronouns remove one basis for those assumptions then why not but im also struggling slightly to imagine a situation where children arent told the name of their teacher in advance the mr or missmrsms might give them a clue
determining the gender of folk sex
oh is this a matter of right and left wing i suppose everything is for some people
how about wanna is that masculine or feminine
not a pronoun for humans it is quite normal in referring to a small child where its sex does not form part of the story
i can see this is something you feel very passionately about and perhaps this is making you rather hasty when it comes to answering comments here as i think i did answer the question of how it could possibly be that your teachers were wrong in my last comment so to e myself you understand i am sure that in any case that language is not immutable but changes and evolves if there is a lack in a language in this case a neuter singular rd person pronoun for referencing humans it is to be expected that common usage will fill that gap and will in time become accepted usage in other words usage has simply evolved since then as well as this we have a different understanding of the mechanics of language see chomski and a different attitude towards how to transmit it my fathers generation were taught the rules of english grammar as if it were a descendant of latin and imposed inappropriate latinate logic as well as an inflexibility that can only apply to a dead language that has ceased to be used and thus has ceased to change this is not how we view english or teach its rules now dont get me wrong there are very definite rules but there is also great flexibility and inevitable evolution of usage and vocabulary whether you like it or not the third person plural is acceptable in the singular if the gender of the person is unknown or not relevant dont waste so much anger on something that you cannot change
very well saidand he and him can be genuinely inclusive for instance if you were telling a tale about what somebody of unspecified sex might do in a particular situation calling the person she would stick out as if you were making a point and they would also stick out as ungainly sticking out is to be avoided and he might be the most inconscpicuous choice gender after all is not sex although some people for their own purposes have been deliberately muddling the two like the writer of this article for whom they absurdly is seen a key to release from oppression
so think about it 
i didnt realise oxbridge professors could be so stupid as to waste their time on such twaddle i really dont see whats wrong with they especially as i dont believe many students if any these days would dream of using he as the generic pronoun
dont you mean it was done by the butler
 women are winning the race because they have higher iqs are harderworking more determined more balanced have more to lose if they dont your kind of sexism gives feminism a bad name and helps keep it in a state of disrepute
madiguana  october  am  yes history is a greek word and in greek its also feminine
i certainly dont got a problem with that
orwell his essay denouncing the passive voice i missed that one dont bother ill save you the trouble by telling you that the butler did it
if someone says they dropped their wallet when they produce proof that its theirs well give it back to them demotic manages well enough i thought the suffix man meant person in anglosaxon that indefinite pronoun means one people they
piscine apprehension operatives
i realised that a little too late oh well my comment still stands for people either a as easily confused as me today or b horribly sexist
employee odd that this word taken directly from french is feminine in that language employé being the masculine form the same goes for néené i expect there are plenty of others
slivka  october  am  if only it were just the suffixes theres the articles for singularplural and gender and then prepositions too its maddening in every sense of the wordbut word order can def be messed about with in greek which is a bit confusing if youre an english native speaker greek learner
i assume youre a man when i was a child i saw the world from an incredibly femalecentric point of view in all the stories i wrote all the characters were female all my toys had girls names i wasnt interested in being friends with boys because i assumed they werent as interesting as girls basically i assumed that girl was the default for people and boys were the other i think this is natural small children always see themselves as the centre of the universe obviously i then grew up and realised that were all people with qualities to contribute and thats the important thing but having reached this realisation yes it did and does upset me that a lot of men are able to continue in their belief that women are the other and that men are the default because of the language we use the films we watch just one example what is the logic behind the daily mail heading every story about a student student for a male and female student for a female if the gender is relevant there it should be male studentfemale student and if its not it should just be student female students have outnumbered males for many years now but women are still treated as an afterthought as the exception same goes for drivers and if you naturally come out with sentences like that they would never come naturally to me for example because i have never seen men as the centre of the universe then its not entirely inconsistent to assume that you have a very malecentric attitude which may lead you act in a sexist way in other aspects of your life
i think its outrageous that anyone has to pay for prison in the first place man or woman im off to make a fuss
dittowas just pulling your leg valid point too btw
hopperla wish i had scrolled down and seen your reply here before writing my own were on the same wavelength right down to the she however thats only useful when written in speaking i would still say he or she
excellent piece i really enjoyed that ive just written one about how annoying it is when nongerman speakers insist on addressing german women with the obsolete term fräulein in a misguided effort to be cute ahrgh httpladyofthecakeswordpresscomlanguagematterswhyitsnotgeiltocallusfraulein
hooray i blame my horrible tiredness for completely missing that good work sir
what is the alternative explanation for the generic he apart from sexism
they for a singular is clumsy illogical ungrammatical its first and foremost very practical and if we dont know the gender like here he or she rolls off the tongue quite nicely dont you think aha so your post is actually one big jest bu in general i am repeatedly amazed to find native speakers who are simply unaware of this option
theres a lot of people in sweden getting very angry about campaigners trying to bring in the genderneutral pronoun hen instead of han he and hon she i dont know why people get so worked up about this it doesnt harm them at all i suspect what you mean is that the people opposing the campaigners are getting worked up but cant you in fact level the same accusation at both sides those campaigning for change and those asking why whats sauce for the goose etc
i just cant stomach the plural with one exception the examples provided in the article all have a plural sense to them and so the plural pronouns arent quite as jarring they can sometimes be the last example a person cant help their birthis cringeworthy its better imo to restructure the statement altogether if the subject is the entire population of planet earth why start the sentence with a singular people cant help their birth we cant help our birth etc also when writing i often use she i didnt invent it but i cant remember where i first encountered it
yup but that then sounds so close to miss that a listener might easily miss the difference if you were talking quickly which is what leads to all the added emphasis the term gets etc etc etc
we might get them confused with the large northamerican weasel
i suppose i dont care as much if somebody thinks my grammar is bad as if they think my reasoning is
why is the headline sexist language rather than say a discussion on the generic he its a fair point but its editorial spin isnt it
well said
after all according to people like this it doesnt matter
ive tried reading winnie the pooh to my son and i believe that aa milne should have had all his english language privileges taken away from him before being thrown in jail
there is a general trend throughout europe to use madame signora frau etc to describe all adult women in french madame has always been used to address an adult woman sometimes the reply comes non mademoiselle or non madame if they were addressed as mademoiselle erroneously but in general it is just judged on the age or maturity of the person concerned it seems to bother no one even if the address isnt their actual legal status sometimes too mademoiselle is used as a rather poor form of flattery on their youthful looks when it should be a madame 
davidikbh  october  am  very well said
jammyyyy knows everything doesnt she
fishers of men fishers of men bible dont get us started 
good lord i hope this is sarcasm then your prayers have been answered
jammyyyy  october  am  your evidence that its only a tiny amount of people who care is what exactly i think youre confusing opinion with facts pumpkin
one person here who agrees with you that the guardian style guide is indeed a ghastly book 
one group were asked to fill it with pictures on subjects like social man family man man at war etc others were given subjects like social life families warfare etc family man is clearly a different subject to families a mother or a daughter is certainly not a family man so of course youd get differences in what pictures would be included can you provide a link to the research if it was something like man the social animal and humans the social animal youd clearly have the same subject and the experiment would be valid similarly with mans inventions and human inventions but social man and social life can be interpreted very differently social man could be taken to mean looking at humans as a social species while social life could mean pubs clubs and parties man in space and humanity in space might be intended to be the same subject but could still be interpreted very differently with yuri gagarin being an example of the headlinestyle man in space and humanity in space being taken in contrast with inhumanity in space with the treatment of animals such as laika being considered
but it makes a mess of grammatical agreement it is often more elegant to recast a sentence in a plural or general form than just replace the pronoun in the page you reference a modern police officer is expected to use their weapon only as a last resort when modern police officers are expected to use their weapon only as a last resort coveys exactly the same sense
ouch well it serves me right i suppose
is fisher itself not acceptable its a common last name and was used in the bible in the phrase fishers of men iirc
ah the perennial debate about epicene they i think milne was on the right track coin a new term but i also think they will win out through simple force of habit shame since it adds potential confusion rather than clarifying thats what is so satisfying about ms does the job no confusion and enhances the language rather than introducing a cop out marshs examples are also a little disingenuous to start with everybody can clearly be used as a plural pronoun as in everybody must be here at  oclock or everyone knew mr knightley by the colour of his jodhpurs thats carroll and the kjv out of the running the they in question is generic they not epicene they theres not much point in arguing with the examples presented from shakespeare or thackeray although to be fair shakespeare is poetry and not prose in addition not a man but has a plural air about it ie not a man nobody noun usable with a plural pronoun gt nobody reads shakespeare these days in the original elizabethan english they must be thick i suppose which effectively leaves thackeray here given that marsh appears to be simply using examples from the wikipedia page on singular they with my apologies if he authored it one might simply point out the context of thackerays e is indeed plural and hence a case of generic they it cant be true what the girls at the rectory said that her mother was an operadancer a person cant help their birth rosalind replied with great liberality thackeray vanity fair  the relevant person here is becky sharp thackeray has rosalind using their as a polite circumlocution perhaps avoiding the directness of she her and generic his in a context involving only women or perhaps with rosalind meaning the statement to apply to people in general with becky sharp as an example httpenwikipediaorgwikisingular_they that said as a translator from german which simply uses the masculine singular as standard i sympathise with marsh and could use an equivalent of ms but im not about to misuse they i actually think she is the most elegant copout currently available short obvious and it logical since he is part of she the mess of heshe or he or she can be neatly encapsulated in a form shorter than either and if anyone disagrees she can go jump in a lake

i think chair is the best and least awkward choice and spokesperson as neither sex nor gender may always be obvious when are these not obvious
good article i try to use they where possible instead of he or she theres a lot of people in sweden getting very angry about campaigners trying to bring in the genderneutral pronoun hen instead of han he and hon she i dont know why people get so worked up about this it doesnt harm them at all that said in finland they just have hän which applies to both genders
oh my god really when did that happen
have you never heard anyone admiring a baby when they dont know whether theyre a boy or girl you hear things like arent they sweet and so on precisely can you imagine someone saying isnt he or she sweet itd sound utterly ludicrous its cracking me up just imagining it
oh hey there we go httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryfisherfolk
i dont believe i have ever heard anybody tweaking the pronouns or the gender agreement in their noun phrases in rebellion against this humiliating situation somebody somewhere must have tried it but the matter never really seems to exercise anybody not so there is a debate about it in france especially the subject of gendered professions a lot of women in traditionally maledominated professions want to be able to refer to themselves with a nonmasculin noun although unfortunately the feminine equivalents often imply a lesser degree of respect for example traditionally president was le président and la présidente was the presidents wife so where does that leave female presidents in spain theres now pressure to say things like alumnas y alumnos instead of just the masculine alumnos schoolchildren or madres y padres instead of padres and a lot of authorities and institutions adopt this method where feasible its often not feasible due to these gender rules being such an integral part of the language and a lot of young people and progressive political groups have started using the symbol as a way of representing the masculine o and feminine a ending at the same time eg chics these things are harder to pull off in the spoken language though its harder to pull off because the sexism inherent in all european societies was incorporated into these languages in a way thats impossible to get around unlike english but not only is it humiliating that women are constantly referred to as an afterthought in these languages but its also highly impractical when you need to refer specifically to a group of men try talking to someone about your brothers in spanish they will always assume you are talking about your brothers and sisters unless you say something like my brothers not my sisters or my grandfathers after several failed attempts i found that the best way of explaining that was by saying both the father of my mother and the father of my father very efficient or fathers i once listened to a whole  minute speech in spanish about paternity leave which used the phrase males who are fathers los varones que sean padres throughout because the plural for fathers padres also means parents
fisherfolk i know its quite archaic but thats what sri lankans use and i reckon its a term from the british colonial days pre
the only reason people want to change the usage of our language is not because they actually care about sexism against women they just want to appear incredibly enlightened and better than the rest of us or theyre thoughtful one of the two
yeah his bible was absolute crap
i think given that the uk has already had a female pm who was not particularly liberal caring or inclusive it was sarcasm
it has the problem of not being something not coming from normal speech but appearing first in writing only this means people have had to decide themselves how to pronounce it but also have to pronounce it so that it doesnt sound like miss in the uk the result is often muzz with an emphasis on the zzz although the americans prefer mizz which sounds so much like miss as to be almost indistinguishable in rapid speech none of this means that women shouldnt be allowed to go by whatever name and honourific they damn well please it just means the pronunciation of the maritalstatusneutral term still trips people
a yesterday i saw someone get off the bus and i couldnt tell what gender he was b yesterday i saw someone get off the bus and i couldnt tell what gender she was c yesterday i saw someone get off the bus and i couldnt tell what gender he or she was d yesterday i saw someone get off the bus and i couldnt tell what gender they were for me a and b arent possible and c is an awkward clumsy construction only d sounds natural i was brought up using the singular they in yorkshire and ive also used it in postgraduate writing usually with a brief note on usage saying that i have used it to avoid sexist writing with the obvious exception of direct ations im confused by commenters trying to make it seem as if the singular they is somehow incorrect clearly weve had it for a long time and it performs a useful role not liking it is a personal preference and i think id say each to their own but accusing users of it as being ungrammatical thats only right if youre prescriptive about how you think language should be rather than describing how it actually is and prescriptivists often break their own rules use said rules to make themselves feel that theyre better than other people or to put down the working classes in some cases

 clumsily female im amused at the thought of someone being clumsily female are they the ones who perhaps on account of a particularly tight schedule have hurriedly and inadvertently installed their vaginas the wrong way round before leaving the house
some very conservative and some liberal professors from both oxford and cambridge use she it feels quite civilized as a small act of protest against the patriarchy good for molding the attitudes of students to question something as basic as the pronouns they use when making examples
i know what you mean its that english is not as inflected as many other languages so the grammar uses different systems i dont know greek but as far as im aware its quite inflected with different cases noun genders etc marked by different suffixes thats certainly the case of the languages i specialise in slavic languages czech slovak polish in particular all three of those languages have three genders and seven cases which is tremendous fun and thats just the nouns what that means is that a lot of the grammar in those languages is done by the morphology particularly by suffixes in english by contrast a lot of the grammar is done by the word order so in the dog bit the postman and the postman bit the dog its only the order of the words that tells you whats the subject and whats the object and it also tells you whats the verb bit could be a noun if it was placed in a different position for example after an article in a language like czech or polish you can rearrange the word order pretty much at will depending on what you want to emphasise because its the endings that tell you whats the subject object verb etc i presume you can do that to a certain extent at least in greek too
no one but a tiny minority of people actually care about this subject the only reason people want to change the usage of our language is not because they actually care about sexism against women they just want to appear incredibly enlightened and better than the rest of us look at this article why is the headline sexist language rather than say a discussion on the generic he it is done to cast within the minds of women who read this article that usage of the generic he must have come into use and been used ever since as a slight to women certainly not for something as innocent as ease of usage these few annointed ones are trying to make a group of people feel victimised so that they can be their rescuers
bet youre one of those who used to write herstory for history in the olden days as a pedant that always bugged me surely it should be hertory not herstory any other construction is admitting that the his in history is not a genderrelated prefix which negates the need for the change and dont get me started on the suffix gate for scandals or holism for addictions
actually id go as far as to say that the message has hardly been heard by anyone well not acted on at least typically french of course just becasue the government makes a rule doesnt mean that the people will follow it i mean this is a republic after all and létat cest moi in the heart of every french manwomanperson
there are a number of perfectly reasonable potential alternatives as you suggest including front voice speaker personally i think we should go with mouthpiece has the advantage of currently being in use although in a generally pejorative sense
but there is a difference between natural ground up change and change forced upon us top down by persons in authority and pressure groups disapproval of singular they is an example of change forced upon us top down by persons in authority and pressure groups
i dont agree as someone who speaks french for  of the time ive obviously got used to on so now when speaking english i use one when it is the most apt and dont feel that it is at all posh cos i certainly aint what annoys me with one though is when people use it incorrectly stand up the royal family and use one when referring to themself one should not complain is fine because it applies to people generally one does not like boiled eggs is not because it is a purely personal matter
we happily resolve the singular and plural use of the word you to the extent that if a glaswegian asks a group of friends are youze coming up town tonight the usage is considered ungrammatical

youre so right besides have you never heard anyone admiring a baby when they dont know whether theyre a boy or girl you hear things like arent they sweet and so on im an editor and was trained in nonsexist language with the aim of the writing being as inclusive as possible
so funny the amount of men who say it doesnt matter when it mattered so much to men that they started the convention and fight for its continuance if it didnt matter it wouldnt have survived until now it matters because a lot of men and some women are heavily invested in the idea that men are neutral human beings and women are a deviation from the norm that men head up and represent women in families and in society that women should be modest and silent partners thats what is behind all this man mankind he chairman stick man drawings and green man on pedestrian crossings business whenever you hear a man say that a sexist phenomenon or relic doesnt matter what they mean is it matters to me but it mustnt matter to you it matters enough to retain it but not enough to change it or i will try this line about it not mattering to see if it it will throw some people off the scent
yes lets replace all three with an appropriately politicallycorrect word hows about comrade
when did it come about for example that some people started to take offence at the word actress as being sexist id say it was less sexist now than it was a couple of hundred years ago when it was basically synonymous with prostitute people used to have a very low view of the acting profession now it really does just mean female actor or if you prefer actor who is most associated with playing female roles do you choose the word you feel most comfortable using yourself if thats the potentially sexist word or do you take the ultracautious constantly selfcensoring approach of not using any word that anyone could find remotely offensive personally id always try to defer to the person i was speaking to i might explain my position on the matter but would be open to the counterargument as i said theres no great need to use actress in most circumstances if i were say chatting to helen mirren i would use the word actor if i were casting for someone to play the lead female role in romeo amp juliet id write that i was looking for an actress itd save key strokes
indeed in an ideal world wed have the same word for he and she in your ideal world but thats not everyones ideal world what a dull world it would be if all our ballads poems and novels were written without specifying gender we are intelligent beings its not too much effort to distinguish linguistic limitations from actual sexism and it certainly isnt necessary to purge he and she from our language i still read hemingway celine and nietzsche i still listen to wagner and enjoy picasso and degas antisemites and sexists the lot of them but would the world really be better without them and more to the point can we as spectators differentiate between their personal ideologies and the works they producedyes i think we can if you want to fight sexism start with terry richardson pop music and the fashion industry and work backwards i say
thats hilarious so you get annoyed with a tongue in cheek you can do it but feel free to exclaim that an interest in grammar for the ordinary folk is a waste of time meet my good friend hypocrisy theyll be here all dayweekyearmillenium delete as applicable
it could be worse polish has separate words for groups of men groups of women and mixed groups simply makes the language ladendown with pointless grammar

notproperty  october  am get ciffix for chrome fishing operative fishop the skipper is an archfishop
how so even adjectives are gendered in french
makes me wonder if its desirable for the words for the role of chairing meetings to have gender attached why has actress dropped out of circulation almost entirely in favour of calling everyone involved actors even the more obviously female ones at least the article rightly hints at both problems though one wants to be genderneutral when talking about roles and one also has to cater for unknownambiguous cases a chairperson called kim or leslielesley for example
yup how the patriachry will tremble when the first woman pm takes the stand it seems only inevitable that the first woman pm will come from the ranks of the labour party given that they have championed inclusivity in everything and have never given in to petty tokenism
marge piercys future people in woman on the edge of time used per as a unisex pronoun it should probably have felt familiar by the end of the book but it still didnt ms does though some things take longer than others how much headway are you making with calling actresses actors why dont people read piercy these days
i like the quaker way of using first names as a general rule but first and last name formally and think it should be universally adopted so everyone would call the queen elizabeth if they were speaking to her but news articles about state occasions would refer to her as elizabeth windsor the queen on first mention queen being her role not her title the format would be the same for everyone
by people you mean wankers
trying to shoehorn english into latin grammar is itself wrong absolutely thats why some people think that you shouldnt say things like its us versus them or you and her should get together because in latin you wouldnt use an oblique case to express the subject or subject complement well bully for latin but english is different saying its we versus they is grammatically incorrect which is why it sounds so weird saying you and she should get together is marginally more acceptable but still not very natural english for most speakers the bizarre objection to split infinitives is another case in point for one thing it ignores the fact that an english infinitive doesnt necessarily have to have the marker to and for another thing its pretty meaningless to say that latin didnt split its infinitives because latin infinitives were single words and as for the objection to putting prepositions at the end of a sentence because latin didnt well truly it is something up with which we should not put
leol  october  am  its postie whatever the sex or gender
ms which i recall being greeted with ridicule when it started to catch on in the s and s is now well established but also still ridiculed people still say it with a slight sarcastic air
they should start using beast as the gender neutral suffix chairbeast headbeast spokesbeast etc
fisher is a perfectly good word its noted in most dictionaries as archaic but hell no reason not to bring it back into vogue if it fits the bill rather than racking brains to invent a new one
good lord i hope this is sarcasm if not its a massively patronising and ridiculous stance to take cant believe i have to type this but not all men are awful macho idiots and not all women are goddess like paragons or virtue people are and always have been more complex than your glib summation
enidblytonprodigy  october  am  in greek the word historia is entirely feminine
funny because every language teacher ive had has mentioned it and seems embarrassed by it
of course in many instances when talking about people in this profession theres no need to use actress but theres also no harm in it actress does not imply lesser worth than actor the thing interests me is less that language changes of course it does but that sensibilities change when did it come about for example that some people started to take offence at the word actress as being sexist it surely hasnt always been so and when some do and some dont find a word like actress offensive what then do you choose the word you feel most comfortable using yourself if thats the potentially sexist word or do you take the ultracautious constantly selfcensoring approach of not using any word that anyone could find remotely offensive it can be quite an exhausting mental process to take the latter approach
can we put an end to an historical an theirtorical oh not what you meant
heesh sheesh
i think theres lots of mythology surrounding the sun and moon which goes back centuries and exists in many cultures the pretext being that the phases of the moon reflected the menstrual cycle the subtext being the sun was the more powerful and more straightforward obvious and honest the moon was a thing of mystery and darkness and changeability much like women and their moods which men have never grasped but it was probably men who assigned the genders to these celestial bodies
good comment ls thanks for summing up nicely
yes youre right bad example on my part lets just say a woman who heads up your local branch will be a manager she wouldnt be governess unless the banks needed teaching a lesson
you wrote sluts and studs a concept devised in the s by academic feminists mainly to justify their own promiscuity absolute twaddle from a rabid antifeminist httpwwwetymonlinecomindexphptermslut specific modern sense of woman who enjoys sex in a degree considered shamefully excessive is by  meaning woman of loose character bold hussy is attested from midc but the primary association through c was untidiness sluts were shamed feminists sought to reclaim the word httpwwwetymonlinecomindexphptermstud meaning man who is highly active and proficient sexually is attested from  that of any young man is from  absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with feminists desperate desperate stuff
please address all your wittering to michael obanreagan
phrase rabid feminist used by feminist writer in feminist book in  at some point this is noted in oed complaint made by white male on twitter in  causes media feeding frenzy not sure who the hell is strangling language with a politically correct corset there is something rotten going on but feminists arent to blame
hi insolito i may as well talk to you as ive already addressed the person who wrote this nonsense and as for cameron he is providing english classes to women that need to learn the language hardly nothing there were english classes for women in the asian communities in the north way back in the s in fact local women could volunteer to help and go into the womens homes i remember seeing an information pack on the table in someones house i dont know how successful this was more recently cameron cut the funding for english as a second language classes that were being provided by adult education institutes and the like anyone impressed by his recent pronouncements is naïve at best
sorry to break this to you but this particular debacle has not required the attention of any real feminists the story is man tweets dictionary dictionary tweets man then media such as the washington post and including the guardian reports twitter storm media see spinoff opportunities and then antifeminists are attracted like flies round shit
httpwwwnytimescommagazineonlanguagedarkwordsofdisapprovalhtml
i dont i just assume youre a patronising git which you are if youve swallowed a simplistic position that denigrates your own gender thats your issue
it all kicked off with a tweet by michael obanreagan please be sure to keep the terms journalism academic rigour and most especially feminism at a safe distance from this farcical phenomenon
michael obanreagan started this whole farce by tweeting about the oxford english dictionary they replied in a flippant unprofessional fashion it was reported in the guardian and other news media across the englishspeaking world now david shariatmadari is jumping on the bandwagon and the anti feminists are crawling out of the woodwork and feminists are being criticised dystopia indeed
did you know that this all started with a twitter storm tweet by michael obanreaganit was reported yesterday apparently but if you can spin another clickbait article out of it well
interesting article i do love a bit of etymology but im a bit confused as to how dog or animal isnt the most obvious collocate of rabid
i presume that youre referring to the author and if so then that is truly offensive
bastard is a term originally meaning in english one of illegitimate birth regardless of gender however in our modern sexist world it is almost never applied to females there are certainly more than  other examples but i have neither the time nor the interest to do the research
michael obanreagan and david shariatmadari are male so please feel free to join in and make it a real sausage fest
well the people hitching themselves to this particular band wagon were michael obanreagan and now david shariatmadari no women were involved
quite michael obanreagan started this whole twitter storm and he is a man not sure about his motivation if he had serious academic concerns about the dictionary surely he would have written to or emailed them privately and expected a serious reply instead he showed off as a smart arse on twitter is he even a feminist the rabid antifeminists dont care its just another bandwagon for them to jump on to denounce feminism
funnily enough i quite like tool
please address your comments to twitter warrior michael obanreagan
i would associate rabid with dog not a woman or feminist if i were going to refer rabid to people is would be religious right wackosmale or female
well the people hitching themselves to this particular band wagon were michael obanreagan and now david shariatmadari no women were involved so it really is total bollocks
theres no such thing as sexism any more because theres no such thing as sex or gender nowadays we are all allowed to be what we want to be on the sexualitygender spectrum this can only be a good thing
michael obanreagan was the person who started this twitter storm in a teacup with his original tweet would you class him as a scold
they responded in a flippant way and then had to apologise for being flippant that is not good but if the offended michael obanreagan had written to or emailed oxford dictionaries in the first place he might have got a reasonable reply what does anyone expect twitter making the media even more stupid than it was already
yes how the working class went from salt of the earth to chav scum although since this article is the tail end of a twitter storm bandwagon i cant see that happening any time soon
im bringing mr shariatmadaris reply forward in the comment chain because there are two problems with it most linguists believe that pejoration happens more frequently to words that refer to women than those that refer to men im not seeking to prove that here just to convey what the consensus is in the discipline first mr shariatmadari states that there is a consensus of most linguists without providing any clue as to where this consensus can be seen we are supposed to simply believe it coming from an unnamed group authority through him because this statement cant be examined and tested it cant be accepted or refuted whatever your inclination to be sympathetic or not second much feminist scholarship has no credibility outside its own circle of feminist scholarship that is to say other scholars typically wont bother to refute ideas that are tendentious and biased toward a foregone conclusion that is because they recognize that a writer of a tendentious paper is not really investigating a question but only asserting a political view
guys you gotta get your defense strategy right here some say women earn more than men some say women earn less because of their own stupidity b
there are some countries where usage is being mandated to remove distinctions which are offensive to a small activist part of the population i doubt seriously if that will change attitudes in the case of the oed however there is an important function in identifying changes in meaning over the centuries which is important in determining what an author of that time meant when he used a particular word that should not be subject to the tampering of social engineers
what would i get if i was implying things like you do about a female person who i disagree with and what would i get if i did an ad hominem instead of actually engaging with rational arguments oh my valerie would sure to raise her eyebrows oh the double standards
i think you forgot the part that the article deliberately forgets everything that does not support the authors claims and twisting the issue issue rather to support his narrative this have not occurred to you right its not like  of the feminist articles do exactly that but i think its easy to miss no it must be all men throwing a hissy fit when they are criticized
understood
its not entirely clear but the article isnt criticising a dictionary michael obanreagan started this whole farce by tweeting about the oxford english dictionary they replied in a flippant unprofessional fashion it was reported in the guardian at the same time as many other news outlets across the englishspeaking world now shariatmadari is jumping on the bandwagon and the anti feminists are crawling out of the woodwork and for some reason feminists are getting a kicking i admire orwell but i doubt even he could have imagined such a twisted distopia
the shortened tart turning into prostitute probably happened due to being prevalent in the conversation of cockneys in which the percentage of prostitutes would have been higher than say a posher accent that didnt shorten sweetheart not sexism just a side effect of reality
this is really getting ridiculous when one uses words to define and acknowledge there are differences between the sexes it is not necessarily sexism sexism is an attitude it is not merely the choice of words one uses
oh i get it youre a man posing as an outraged feminist in solidarity with michael obanreagan the guy who started this whole storm in a teacup with a twitter tweet and youre doing it under an article by david shariatmadari are any women actually involved in this farce your last sentence still makes no sense
you obviously know them better than i do as you introduced me to the terms but i just said that because id googled them and those didnt seem to be the origins im sure feminists have used them but apparently dudebro is from gaming httptakimagcomarticleits_hard_out_here_for_a_dudebro_jim_goadprintaxzzyypykagf and there is no reference to feminists in this on neckbeardhttpknowyourmemecommemesneckbeard im with you on mansplaining though
i thought this article very educational and yet anything to do with the inequality of the sexes gets the ire up in a lot of men guess this article hit a nerve as it should i read the comments because i wanted to see once again how annoyed men get when pointing out the inequities that exist between genders theyre obviously tired of hearing about it and just wish women would shut their noise hole and stop nagging men all the time asking for the same respect that men give each other which they perceive in their twisted logic as unearned privilege why cant women just smile sweetly like theyre suppose to what is truly telling about these commenters is how they even went after the authors ethnicity as not being qualified to write an article like this what contempt these men must have and yet the oxford dictionary applies rabid to feminists rabid is never a word that ive seen women display however ive seen some pretty violent brutal rabid men and listened to their comments right here for this article nothing gets men more riled up and rabid when their gender is criticized yet they sure can dish out and have been for thousands of years
there is no feminist stance here what we have is a lone male michael omanreagan whinging on twitter and then oxford dictionaries acting like twats before you know it every media outlet in the englishspeaking world is all over it and of course then it attracts the usual suspects on the guardian speaking as outraged feminists eg tomsmells above you couldnt make it up utterly pathetic i really wonder why they used a e from a  book by a feminist ann oakley to illustrate current usage of the word rabid this whole thing is a complete and utter farce and nothing to do with feminists although michael omanreagan might be onto something with the useless oxford dictionaries people who knows the whole thing is pathetic there are real feminists out there fighting rape domestic violence fgm etc as per usual nothing has changed signed a feminist
the proliferation of spotted pages was also wholly misunderstood and taken to be misogynistic stalking as opposed to a joke with both males and females taking part equally
just to point denigration is an extremely racist term meaning to turn black which became somehow to turn something bad just saying and please less male tears sexism is still about women we live in a misogynistic society
its a terrible word for about a thousand reasons misogyny being among them interestingly though i suppose unsurprisingly the people who tend to use are overwhelmingly men like take reddit for example if you go to the mensrights subreddit and search mangina you will get pages and pages and pages of results with titles like feminists and manginas appropriate and colonize the mrm or mangina of the year awards  cast your votes i mean in defense of the mensrights subreddit wow i never thought id hear myself saying that there is one recent post about how the word mangina is ridiculous sad and misogynistc but youd think that given how much of a fuss they make over societys expectations of men they wouldnt want to add to the pressures of men by labeling anybody who doesnt conform to their masculine ideals as a mangina yet they do then you have other popular and more terrible maledesignated spaces where the number of results is larger and the posts are even worse then you look at a womens subreddit like twoxchromosomes where there are no results for the word mangina and rfeminism has one result which is from a post decrying the use of words like mangina i suppose it makes sense really why would women use a word like mangina as an insult its literally suggesting that women are bad submissive and weak so why do so many men still use it
grating is certainly used to describe mens voices and shrill to describe the content of their utterances shrill just means high pitched but appears to have acquired a negative connotation recently
women sometimes get both genders of an animal hurled at them a woman can be equally a bitch or a dog if a man is described as a dog it is often in a phrase which is in some way admiring such as he was a salty old sea dog whereas a woman who is a dog is of loose morals andor standards of cleanliness and presentation in scotland rat is one that will almost always be a man pig is neutral but yes dog would more likely be used for a female
grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens has there been any textual analysis of stuff like this digital humanities is a growing field and linguists and translators have used software for a while i ask because in conversation at least i have referred to quite a few highpitched southern english male voices such as george osbornes as grating and im almost certain shrill too
personally as a language student i think we should return to that former usage i understand the usefulness of gender as a word with its current meaning but think a separate word would be better than using an admittedly now mostly defunct at least as far as enlgish is concerned grammatical term
no its not
exactly right
or in many cases even bothered to read it
really have you spent more than two minutes looking at what feminists post online the problem the problem is that many modern third wave feminists cherry pick the comments from the past that they want to accept and ignore the rest that are more extreme inclusive radical and dangerous this is the problem this is why those critical towards feminism will believe that feminists sometimes behave in a rapid way
it doesnt take any intellectual gymnastics to understand feminism which particular feminism are talking about
patriarchy is the spurious view that all men have power over all women and nope
all the words in this article have been downgraded over time to refer to women as inferior to men no not all and not exclusively to men
the author delivered his point across using examples of english words that could be sexist however i dont believe that anyone would use these words in a misogynistic manner nowadays i understand that these words were used long time ago and it wont be expected from people to stop using them just because they can be understood in a negative way if the author really wanted to mention words that can be sexist then he could have mentioned words that are sexist towards men too feminism is not about women only anymore men should be involved too the author should have cited examples of english words that offend men too i have to say that i agree that some of the words above are sexist but other words too are not necessarily sexist
eg sie ist eine wissenschaftlerin there are  pointers to the sex of the person in  words its impossible to be gender neutral in german
its interesting that the e doesnt give any indication as to the authors point of view about rabid feminists whats interesting about it they dont explain any of the other examples such as rabid methodist it seems at least plausible that she was using the expression with some irony possibly but that doesnt mean there wasnt a meaning attached to the word rabid in her use of it it seems at least plausible that she was using the expression with some irony
you may think that but others differ the actual result of the complaint was which may well result in its removal for an easier life or it may not and either way it wouldnt be the removal of a word or even the redefinition of a word only the removal of one of  different sample phrases used i dont particularly care if it is removed or kept personally but lets not exaggerate the impact of losing it which is patently both hysterical and just plain wrong id say its a bit of an exaggeration rather than plain wrong i agree which is why some aspects of feminism sadly loud and with a platform are a major issue there was no manners and respect in the approach to tim hunt or matt taylor i can agree with that its in common usage because it is a very apt description for the type of feminist that writes the articles that generate the responses you feel are kneejerk id say it is in common usage like other political and ideological slurs as a way of undermining the person without engaging with the argument i dont personally agree with a lot of what emer said but it is instructive how much irrelevant antifeminist abuse is being generated even by the article above which barely makes any suggestions on the subject especially in this example which is editorially neutral given that it validly describes a type of feminist validly are rabid feminists or rabid tories for the sake of balance literally frothing at the mouth and out of their minds or are they just people saying relatively extreme things that you or i might not agree with i accept we have to be careful about appeasing demands for changes to dictionaries etc but if i were the editor of that dictionary i would think this wasnt one of my better moments and that the entry could have lived with  entries instead of 
the depth of sexism is quite clear when even a mild article about historical linguistics generates hosts of misogynistic comments that are far more rabid than anything most feminists say
resists all meaningful progressive change is a good description of the loudest bits of modern feminism
when i was young admittedly many decades ago now i was taught that people have sex and words have gender french is a gendered language and it used to be that the word gender was not used to describe or distinguish between male and female attributes in people animals or plants but people became squeamish over the use of the word sex so its definition was narrowed while that of the word gender was broadened by conflating two concepts that previously were quite separate 
and the best actress award goes to a female actor for her performance as a manwoman in a film about transgender where she plays a female waiter oh sorry apparently she is in the wrong category can someone call the language police and get the lawyers on this asap
beware of conflating the clickbait headline not written by the author but a subed with the actual article
higher status than king and gentleman i dont see that as a counterexample
yeah with all that terrible misandry men only earn more than women because of their inherent genius b men earn more than women what all of them check the ons stats on pay to see that the overall average which is the only bit which supports your point shouldnt be used to inform how individuals people are paid therefore dont show that men are paid more than women
sure those are all reasonable queries that could be addressed to the author of what is in the end a fairly light bit of comment although  words variably popular words out of  ish is not indicative of sexism being at the heart of the language always beware of conflating the clickbait headline not written by the author with the actual content of the article which doesnt make that claim at all
firstly bear in mind the author doesnt write the headline secondly that doesnt answer the question this article in particular clearly doesnt call for any word to be banned
in view of all the stupid sexist guy comments here id say the author has made his point well with good examples of how english words relating to females devolved into sexist meanings over time hey guys methinks you are trying too hard to cover up your inherent sexism it shines through all the namecalling attempts at distraction and denial
and if feminist follows rabid as a contemporary example of collocation it doesnt follow rabid preceding feminist happens when the feminist in question is rabid it doesnt very often if they arent misogynist preceding male or references to men rather than some men or the idea that misogyny is endemic is far more prevalent stating the latter indicates a view of male attitudes to females in general that is very poor the performance of females throughout education doesnt support the idea that hatred of them is in any way endemic it doesnt even support the idea using the widened definition some use of holding poor attitudes to women in general moving on to pay females benefit on average from a gpg in parttime work they also benefit on average in fulltime work from ages  again just not ons stats which support the idea of endemic misogyny
id give more ticks if the site didnt keep recognising me
both thick on purpose and terrible in other words sexist
by the waypeople is an inclusive word it is not a group privilege 
that was the one with the fruity bits in it that you could shake about wasnt it
i do not wish to ban anything i think reality is worth to be perceived otherwise how could power structures using manipulations be observed
well recognizing it is an important first step nobody ever did anything about a problem before they knew about it
the only way that i have heard any of these words used is ironically
and as men are physically stronger than women in  of cases source we know who comes out worse off in  per cent of cases there are  about  of male victims of dv not all of them will be smaller than the women who are abusing them httpwwwonsgovukonsrelcrimestatscrimestatisticsfocusonviolentcrimeandsexualoffencesindexhtml your language has explicit violence towards males
maybe a lot of people are fed up with the bs metanarrative then perhaps they could demonstrate it with less enthusiasm
once upon a time i used to mime listening to my crotch if some one was spouting rubbish then when theyd ask what was that all about i could respond talking bollocks
ffs guardianisms at their worst how on earth can you overlay current attitudes on societies and conditions going back to the middle ages even the language at the time is not sexist it only becomes sexist when you hold them up to current attitudesif you have to write something write on something that is relevant now
wealthy russians still live in the cth
whatever your views about feminism maybe relax and realise that raising awareness of embedded biases in language and culture helps gently nudge away from those biases and surely thats not such a terrible thing that is a great idea as long as the awareness and nudging arent all aimed at a single gender as if they are the only ones with these biases and they all share them and you dont need to have a hissyfit men are still in charge of all the things hypocrisy is strong in a certain strain of feminist hissyfit describes a large section of the feminist output here men are decidedly not in charge of things some men and some women are certainly in the western world there are many women who are far more in charge and powerful than the vast majority of men
your dictionary is older than the majority of voters
bitch dog cow dog isnt gender specific i think id rather be a woman being accused of being a bitch or a cow than a man being accused of being a beast
hedy lamarr did not invent frequency hopping and so cannot be credited with the invention of wifi indeed she and her husband everyone forgets the equal partner george antheil in the spurious claim merely patented a method to control torpedoes using the existing technology of frequency hoping to be honest given the patent explains the system relying on musical analogies it is way more likely antheil rather than lamarr was the brains in the endeavor no frequency hoping was invented and patented by telsa in  and then later by willem broertjes with a book about it written in  by jonathan zenneck somebody somewhere decided that they must find a bit of modern technology invented by a woman and they looked everywhere the best they could come up with was a use of an existing technology to guide weapons of war hey i thought women didnt do war that was patented by a husband and wife team by ignoring the husband that the patent only used the relevant technology not invented it and that previous patents and texts exist they have proven that a woman invented wifi even if she had invented it which she hadnt singular women have also committed evil personally id say people are responsible for all the good and all the ill without dividing it by gender
ive never seen them used in any other context
while the article is about things that have been made up by men in order to denigrate women how do you know the rabid feminist reference in oxford dictionaries was made up by men nor can it possibly be described as being used in order to denigrate women not all feminists rabid or not are female nor are all women feminists nothing to do with their behaviour at all its a description of particular feminist behaviour like yours to be honest combative dishonest or woefully misinformed and most often massively hypocritical your comment is a really great example of male stupidity irony alert
please what does sexism mean exactly my shorter oxford dixctionary  does not list this word and does it exist at the heart of other languages
would you like to point out who in any article on this subject has called for any words to be banned was this column titled in praise of
erm i was saying that women can abuse children and do great damage be it mental or physical abuse pointing out the crimes of isis doesnt mean women cant abuse be it mental or physical its not that complicated really you seem to be saying that because isis kill girls strangely you didnt mention all the males theyve put to death there are no female child killers or female peodophiles which is obviously nonsense look at the statistics and also realise women find it easier to get away with it because it can often happen during maternal practices excessive washing of a boys genitals during bath time maybe youre ok with that i dont know but you arent half protesting too muchwomen kill and abusetheyre the facts
english is a vulgar bastard language but it is pure of heart it may say things you dont like but if you know how to talk to it you will find that it is always on your side and if you still think it is against you you will find it is mocking itself it is what you make of it so you must look to yourself for its beauty and its ugliness
or because when trying to correct two hundred thousand years of one half the human race screwing over the other half for no reason other than that it can for a significant period of time much of the screwing over was done by and on behalf of many of the members of the half of the human race which you think was solely a victim done to many of the other half which you simplistically think were all oppressors theres bound to be a few inconsistencies and rough edges your stupid and sexist view along with the idea that half the human race ought to be punished for the actions of a minority simply for sharing a gender with some oppressors is way beyond that just accept society has been unequal for as long as there has been society and that that must stop but defining unequal simply along gender lines must also stop and finally accept that minor inconsistencies like a waitress being allowed to call you sweetheart but you cant reciprocate is really not all that important by comparison no it is really important because its exactly the type of genderbiased approach that should be eradicated not propagated in some kind of payback for the sins of the father nightmare thinking your sexist approach and simple and wrong definition of oppression is in no way fair and just to all nor is it likely to result in a society that can be defined that way
a bit thick actually whats your plan
i would venture to guess that anon who wrote so many poems without signing them was often a womanyou dont get to hear what women do dont give the men credit women arent labelled geniuses yet a mere actor example tom hardy or gary oldman will get called a genius simply for acting it took hedy lamarr about  years to be recognised for creating the original wifi technology they only saw her as a sex objectthe more women choose education over family the more they will overtake men in the fields you mention
when rajiv gandhi was indian prime minister he visited australia and his effortlessly good english made bob hawke sound like an inarticulate idioti agree that indians and pakistanis speak very good english i cant agree with your bob hawke put down he was able to hold his own with anyone but i do feel embarrassed when abbott represents us overseas he looks acts and sounds ridiculous
i mean think about it this country spent quite some months following clive palmer thats a return to eighties endofbjelke its a bit awesome when you think about it but what does it mean
so you gotta wonder about what kind of a winduptoy everyonesfriendtonyabbott really has become at least thats my assessment tony look what youve done mate youve undermined your own system in the weirdest way things are coming unstuck
now if you can do that demand respect and demand they toe the line and actually get them to do that you can probably rule but then you get the head of the army in or the navy or the feds or any of those big name corporations in themselves and they do the same thing the same thing chew gum put their feet up on your desk and flick through the racing guide so a woman cant run the country because they cant make those guys do what they are told now putting a governor general general in might be the only way to proceed because the authority of the government is seriously undermined once they realize they dont have to do what theyre told so we gotta wonder about the high labor refugee intake
now macquarie is approved to give the right story and i suppose that it would be politically naive to think that that was not a huge part of this story minister pyne sniffed and said well thats macquarie ticked off
she was saying stand up straight when you talk to me and do not look at your watch you pay attention and you behave with respect and if you dont like that get out and the response was huh laughter who the hell does she think she is what a joke laughter that is really unbelievable god can you believe that she got in by toppling rudd and she thinks she can talk to us about respect she cant do that they said oh said the macquarie dictionary hang on a second everyone do you have a moment there take a look at this
when prime minister fraser died there was a video interview on fairfax between two fairfax journalists men and i was taken by how much they sounded like the two guardian journalists the first impression of course is that it is that they are women i am not so sure though that that is the entire story clive palmer says it is that they are politically naive how he says that is by calling them or implying that they are women what he means is that they are not the political insiders that is the ones who are informally approved to give the right story is macquarie right is it entrenched prejudice against women it seems likely to be a large part of it certainly but there is more there is a kind of behaviour a kind of dialogue a kind of narrative that aims to exclude and denigrate not just women but anyone who will not go along with the game of the moment the game being to convince others to join if possible without force or coercion as the writer suggests to do otherwise to refuse to participate gets you marked as shrill uninformed ineloquant or fickle sneering whatever somehow gillard slapped that down that day and the response was pretty interesting but we dont know for sure that it was actually the misogyny bit that had the biggest power it could be that it was her standing up and saying enough of this crap you dont run things here i do i reckon abbotts team both inside his opposition team and inside gillards team in government were caught out not expecting that to be the agenda of the day
word abusepolitics is more like self abuseor at least that is part of the essential criteria to become a card carrying member of the lnpand there is many that meet the criteria comfortably
whistleblowing in straya watch this abc program if you want to see what the political establishment and the police are really like you can ignore the happy ending abc journalistic rubbish at the end we all know thats crap
analyse hockeys hyperbole without going troppo i challenge you
thanks gary the issue in a nutshell political speech is strewn with euphemisms to mask the obvious unpalatability of neoliberal ideology to many of us so until we learn what is really intended by shouting dont hide behind coded language we will continue to get policies that give us the rough end of the pineapple what a salutory lesson the abbott govt has been in this regard reform anyone
deconstructing any governments abuses of language for their political ends facts sheet column would be a real addition to guardian australia
look uh its tony abbott look uh hes with the press look uh hes got this habbott what is it look uh guess poetic licence
it reminds me of a line said by the character of heather dunbar wink to orwell in the american series house of cards  is this how you live with yourself by rationalising the obscene into the palatable 
the most remarkable thing about australian political life is the sheer amount of regulation civil regualtion they pass those who havent been there will be amazed at how the state treats its citizens like they are children and those who have never been to australia will be amazed how many aussies like it that way
george orwell still has not been surpassed for his succinctpolitical language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
um er lip smack its the well its the its the greatest no the greatest achievement the greatest achievement of abbott since he became minister for women axing the carbon tax
what about a team that excludes majorities where ever they reside in the west
you um left um out um the um most um annoying um thing um about um public um speaking um in um australia can you guess what it is
there is no evidence that push factors affect boat arrivals to australia changes to pull factors in the form of government border policies have had a clear and extreme impact on arrivals in both directions this is not at all surprising and i do not pretend that the risk of deaths at sea is the primary reason i support strong border policies however it is part of it what was it sarah hansonyoung said about asylumseeker drownings tragedies happen or something you cannot just ignore the fact that people smuggling is a dangerous trade for its clients
a couple of complete buffoons in charge in aust amp nz is key actually competentabbott is both buffoon and incompetent and dishonest
the shit that happened
main stream media msm will not question the donkey they supported otherwise they will look like dingbats msm canabilised itself in support of tony who can forget australia needs tony abbott and now must eat its regurgitation or go without they now have to defend their pretend to they know better syndrome their insiders view no msm you do not know better you know different but that is not necessarily mean it is better samuel johnson said  integrity without knowledge is weak and useless and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful msm had and has knowledge but will not acknowledge that they were and are wrong they will obfuscate and dance around the knowledge to suite their narrative and that makes it dangerous example how many of msm brought to the attention this to the australian people and it is important for australia which is seen as the new eldorado for csg httpwwwnytimescomusoklahomaacknowledgeswastewaterfromoilandgaswellsasmajorcauseofquakeshtml msm built its craft on massaging and workshopping the english word and now want to say do not blame us the people for the abbott government there is a bevy of journos working in mps offices skilled in word smithingmassaging words to suit the narrative of the few to fool the many tony abbott from memory did do a degree in journalism and he know what he is saying he was breastfed or bottled fed which ever on the english language and he knows exactly what he is saying and he uses it as a divisive tool must say to great effect his strategy is calculated and deliberate and msm excuses it as tony speak or he misspoke or he is misunderstood his heart is in the right place excuses excuses excuses the only way abbott know he can stay in power is to ensure that there is division and conflict which creates uncertainty and which makes great headlines and sound grabs he even put his back benchers and cross benchers on notice come after me and i will call a dd and they all want to stay in their seats
it is time the queen did something about the governments of australia and new zealand she does still have the power to dissolve the parliaments i hope or have abbott and key done away with that as well not only are they both very very stupid and therefore dangerous but they are also a public embarassment with their open corruption and little boys will be boys attitude
your response will of course be to label me a leftie as if its an insult but its a little naïve of you to think that there is an appreciable difference between people fleeing persecution arriving here and people seeking persecution being intercepted and towed away in humanitarian terms deaths at sea is a convenient excuse for people who just dont want people seeking refuge from persecution to be here and its used cleverly because the basic difference is just that we dont know now how many people drown at sea nor is any acknowledgment of the huge influence of push factors on numbers ever given
no excuses government that says what it means and does what it says i was watching out foxed again recently and i noticed that this was a line used by reporters in reference to bush on fox news word for word murdoch rehashed it for australias very own bush incarnate tony abbott httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpohhumdk
poor you you cant be a misogynist xenophobic racist islamophobe without being heckled for it life sure is tough
not to mention his actions towards bernie banton as he sought to look after the interests of james hardie
yeah expecting anyone to think pyne is not odious is unreasonable i do think that adam is probably right that this article is a little unbalanced there can be no doubt however that abbott seems to be the least literate and most dependent on clichés and catchphrases of any pm even more than jwh
no cuts to health not cuts to education no cuts to the pension no cuts to the abc or sbs
this abbott led government will go down in history as i will let you put your own comments here
scatology skătŏləjē skən pl scatologies the study of fecal excrement as in medicine paleontology or biology also called coprology obscene language or literature especially that dealing pruriently or humorously with excrement and excretory functions
and the coughing why is he always coughing plus i have noticed that often before he starts talking his mouth opens and just sort of hangs there for a second or two while his brain clicks into gear
i grew up in australia and the only people i have ever known to say fair dinkum are those who are anything but
yes but he has to repeat everything   even  times he has to repeat everything
what about the fact that most of what abbott has to say is either misleading grossly exagerated or an outright lie like this which is mostly liesno cuts to education no cuts to health no change to pensions no change to the gst and no cuts to the abc or sbs according to abc fact checks promise tracker he is up to  definite broken promises which i believe is quite generous with many of the in progress promises like building subs in sa essentially broken he also said my aim is to lead a no surprises no excuses government that says what it means and does what it says five days before the election which has also turned out the be a lie
it ceremoniously updated its definition of misogyny tweaking it from pathological hatred of women to an entrenched prejudice against them its editor is ed as saying that it had failed to keep pace with linguistic evolution  yes and another more uptodate definition of the use of the word misogyny indeed perhaps its most common usage would be shut up you must be stopped from speaking because i dont have the intellectual equipment to argue properly andor my position is indefensible this definition would also apply to words like islamophobia xenophobia and racism and the great coverall right wing
as health minister abbott was a nightmare he let his religious beliefs determine health outcomes absolute stupidity at its finest also he was in charge around the time the medicare debacle reared its ugly head a direct result of defunding medicare and freezing rebates which ended up with hoards of australians going to the hospital to see a doctor for treatment for commonly gp related issues
yepfair suck of the sav saveloy not savignon
its an australian colloquialism griselda knowing no individual genesis used on or off the field in or out of the front bar
i agree that slogans are not bad use of english let me try to explain what is going on when abbott speakshe could speak properly if he chose his garbled syntax and the inevitable criticism are cold blooded tactics to connect with the unwashed as was his use of shirtfront which is a regional colloquialism confined to those who follow the afl code of football there was a state election on at the time and this was his mo for relating to the people who use that termmuch more sinister is his tactic of speaking the truth but only to deceive his mentor a previous liberal pm had this down to a fine art while promising no new or increased taxes he blithely introduces levys copayments indexing of fixed rates etc while all the time insisting that these charges or changes are neither taxes nor newabbotts bumbling is really confined to tv interviews it is deliberate and intended to connect with the unwashed
the fact that tony abbott often misspeaks the suppository of all wisdom and devolves into malapropism trite slogans and simplistic repetition does not mean that he is not a dangerous politician using language often quite effectively to deceive the public reframe debate in terms advantageous to his goals and intentionally say the exact opposite of what is true more salient than that abbott is a butcher of the language is the fact that he is a dangerous liar when he saysi was a health minister for four years i like to think that i was the best friend that medicare ever had when i was the health minister and i am determined to ensure the abbott government is the best friend that medicare ever has the truth is the opposite he hates public health for ideological reasons and will degrade the system if allowed tony abbott and all of team australia are skilled in orwellian linguistic manipulations including the ability to repeatedly aver that black is white with conviction christopher pyne this morning on the abc repeatedly made the case that direct action is not only an effective but a cost effective policy when the evidence suggests the exact opposite as orwell said first they steal the words then they steal the meaning it would be a real addition to guardian australia to have a column every week deconstructing the abbott governments abuses of language for their political ends
here you go folks art imitating life httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpavamfgo
well agree to disagree from a european perspective who knows the horror of terrorism and a political discourse that avoids division to calm down a situation here th december the divisive nature was in the air and it was illridewithyou that calmed down the situation the public was lauded for it internationally 
more salient than that abbott is a butcher of the language is the fact that he is a dangerous liar when he saysi was a health minister for four years i like to think that i was the best friend that medicare ever had when i was the health minister and i am determined to ensure the abbott government is the best friend that medicare ever has the truth is the opposite he hates public health for ideological reasons and will degrade the system if allowed
that was bob carrs figure it was reported here httpwwwnewscomaunationalbreakingnewsboatarrivalstotopcarrstoryefrfku among other places as i said though that was the peak annualised figure i would not want to be accused of misleading anyone at least not with a basis it fell away quite quickly after rudd redux brought back offshore processing which means quite a bit of the credit for stopping the boats can be attributed to the dying days of the last labor government
no i dont when someone claims were a team and that team excludes minorities or those most in need of feeling included its a dangerous distortion of the word similarly when euphemisms for tax are slipped into the vernacular its a conniving tactic to deface our language and rip us off it does matter we should call it out and call it what it really is its us who will be paying after all
they were stopped after labor said no people who arrive on them would be settled in australia this happened after the greens and liberals blocked regional processing
i am a bit tired of this claiming that shirt fronting is an afl term i grew up in sydney in the s not an afl in sight and my father used the term a bloke in the pub would shirtfront another over some altercation literally he would grab the other by the front of his shirt and pull him in tight for a face to face in time it became more metaphorical
abbot says the strangest things which barely have anything to do with the subject at hand until we remember he is aiming for the sound byte for his followers on the evening news
i agree with you mostly but as for illridewothyou was illtimed and i believe only posted to distract attention from the behaviour of monis people were facing death in the café and those who ultimately died had their situation minimised and the publics attention diverted to muslim women because one took her scarf off and not because anything had happened to herit was much ado about nothing
hear hear
does it really matter most people dont have a great grasp on language anyway even those who have degrees or are supposedly educated the language in australia and the dictionaries of today so crammed with slang and senseless acronyms not to mention atrocious spelling that ive given up this includes media so for you gary to write about this is sort of potkettle dont you think
it is my understandink that temporary tony had at one stake achieved the position of roads scourer and was duly shipped off to the old dart no doubt havink his ten pounds refunded to ket tutored in the ways of enklish kentlemenapparentlg this was a an abject failure as it seems that he is still unable to differentiate between the letter k as in gnight and the letter g as in somethinkperhaps it time that the kreat literary kenius crissy pineinthebutt to take him under his classically educated wink and learn him his queens enklish only prissy chrissy gnows more about queens than most
 succesful arrivals source please this figure seems vastly exaggerated
only in australia a man being a minister for women what a sick joke dumbing down the opening speech of g in brisbane by talking about national policies in an international gathering hello then martin place drummed as terrorism in its early hours so much so that illridewithyou saved the day it was so palpable that turning ugly was the desired outcome by a dirty mind supported by a murdoch tweet at am then a pm deafening silence about the ugly reclaim salacious misinformation that emphasises his divisive stand against the best interest of a multicultural cohesion the harassment of ms triggs the dismissal of asylum reports gone in  seconds i wish it was him and not the schooner third world developing country stink of nepotism and corruption in politics and thats what it has become tribal the warmonger is a bully boy speaker with an open warfare on class sex status and religion ps great article thanks
ha ha indeed good pick up its an on water matter
actually one of the reasons i read and comment on the guardian is that it broadens the mind to be confronted with views that are very much opposed to your own you are forced to defend and in some cases reevaluate your existing assumptions and opinions by contrast only in the context of the most deeply entrenched guardianista groupthink could a handful of unsuccessful people smuggling attempts over  months down from a peak annualised rate of  successful asylum arrivals be seriously advanced in support of a contention that the government has failed to stop the boats it is a laughable suggestion so perhaps it is you who should stop posting on the guardian and broaden your horizons a little bit in any event i think i will keep posting here sorry of course you can feel free to ignore my comments
sadly i agree with you i had an argument with the guy i live with the other day about just this issue those slogans and feel good simplistics seem to be deliberately aimed at those most likely to fall for it
we have often had prime ministers who are awful public speakers when rajiv gandhi was indian prime minister he visited australia and his effortlessly good english made bob hawke sound like an inarticulate idiot lee kwan yew used to run linguistic rings around any australian politician he was up against look how excited we are that julie bishop can speak the sort of measured diplomatic language that is just a given in other countries
you can see why abbotts ilk retain popularity they purport to offer certainty in easily understood slogans the likes of krudd meanwhile are way too wordy with their neverending white papers and long jargonfilled essays we only have ourselves to blame what with our tall poppy syndrome and culturallyaccepted derision of academicsintellectuals
umerumumer ad nauseum
not a week goes by when abbott doesnt manage to mangle the english of the queen he supposedly adores
just a couple of very typical tony abbotts es abortion is the easy way out men are by physiology or temperament are more adapted to exercise authority or to issue commandmen have more power generally speaking than women is that a bad thingwhat the housewives of australia need to understand as they do the ironing as julia put it every day in every way abbott is sexist and misogynist
pyne is odious
has this author considered that the pm might use some of these terms precisely because people like him object so humourously to them wow what an inspirational pm we have he uses words and phrases merely because they will annoy certain segments of our society wonderful what a magnificent human being and leader one that governs and leads for all australians anyone who supports abbott is on the same mental and compassionate level as abbott abbotts stop the boats slogan i would actually call it an objective but why split hairs was derided by lefties as an impossible dream if it is an objective and has not been achieved especially after  months in government and being their equal top priority objective then you have not proven the left to be wrong please stop posting on the guardian while differing points of view are great and discussing them can be informative the only thing your words ever do is try to deceive and misrepresent
maybe because he was educated in a pommy finishing school
wasnt the popularity of rudd and turnbull attributed to their ability to sound as though they knew what they were talking about and meant what they said without soundbites and polliewaffle
in abbott case its the repetition that is most mind numbing its not just the stupid slogans we have stopped the boats totally neglecting to mention that there are vulnerable needy people in those boats nor does he mention how they were stopped with abbott its the repletion we have stopped the boats we have stopped the boats more slowly the second time somehow trying to convey that if he says it twice then it must be sincere and everything is alright where in reality it is deception by repetition say it enough and people will accept anything
i would not buy anything off rabbittabbott and with that look i would not take anything from him either actually i am still waiting for the promised  as i am sure many other are come on abbott time to pay up
its easy i save you cut
saving lies at sea freudian slip
yes actually i am this article seems to be more of an extended whinge about tony abbott and the coalition than any serious critique of the washedout language used in australian politics which is a vice of all parties not even just the big two for example if this guy was serious he would not have beatified st julia but rather mentioned some of her own sins in this space these included such things as declaring that a line had been crossed in relation to the craig thomson scandal without being able to explain what said line actually represented she also described a projected budget surplus which of course never eventuated as being locked in and that is just off the top of my head and has been heavily edited for length the author also described christopher pyne as odious which was nothing other than a gratuitous personal attack hardly the kind of thing someone genuinely interested in the standard of political discourse would do unless he was being an odious hypocrite himself that is
its not just the mangling of language but the poverty of the character of those members of the abbott government that appals me in opposition abbott was the constant harpy pouring bile on gillard at every opportunity now as prime minister he leaves australia open to ridicule every time he opens his mouth with his outright lies his threats bully and bluster demonstrates what an inadequate man he is he is a national embarrassment in the words of xavier herbert poor fellow my country
its embarrassing im a grown adult and i would like to be communicate to as such by the politicians who represent me exactly instead of having a prime minister who tries to lift us to our best we have one who does everything he can to make us be our worst and quite frighteningly many australians want that and enjoy that
dead right
or challenge the idiots for the difference between a lie and the truth
were looking for savings from health and education and yet noone in the media will ask what the difference between a cut and savings are
besides all of his endless three words slogans gaffes malapropisms etc i also abhor his overuse of meaningless stock phrases the worst one is we will be the best friend ltinsert policy they intend to defundtear downgt has ever had its embarrassing im a grown adult and i would like to be communicate to as such by the politicians who represent me
 the pm might use some of these terms precisely because people like him object so humourously to them very unlikely simple is as simple does but if youre right it makes him even more unfit for office as it is just puerile and facile the type of undergraduate glibness made infamous by poodles pyne abbott supporters in victoria must be feeling pretty lonely by now
onyer gaz
this is the catch pollies face use polished but anodyne language informed by focus groups and strangled of life by committees advisers and speechwriters or be real unguarded heartfelt and impassioned but risk being shot down as shrill uninformed or ineloquent i think you understated negatives of the practised speech format in this politicians become vastly mistrusted when it is assumed they have selected their words too carefully people start to analyse statements to look for the loophole unless youre preaching to the converted you dont get a lot of respect for it by contrast we have a chuckle at jacqui lambies outbursts but when shes on the money people will claim shes a breath of fresh air transparency and accountability should be congratulated even if you disagree with the content
now corrected thanks
it has now been corrected thanks
thanks for this both now corrected
only if it wasnt manufactured in australia which it wont be before long
not to mention the  hand gestures he uses in an attempt to add gravitas to what he says there have been better communicators than him who were just as thick reagan comes to mind
we havent stopped the boats we are stopping asylum seekers even to the point of taking them on naval vessels back to vietnam reclaiming australia but then that is the point of stop the boats isnt it boats human asylum seekers
i think youre conflating this article and a critique of policy i find team australia repugnant and successfully achieved laughable but the article admittedly by a person who in todays australia would be considered a rampant leftie is about the dreadful use of language in politics
its more representative of how far down the rabbit hole political discourse has gone in this country also it reflects how simpleton some voters are likely yourself included ps the boats are still coming
the pm trips over his tongue regularly the suppository of wisdom this week gave us vaccinised
i am exposing my terrible grasp of sports apologies
seems optimistic but lets keep everything crossed
very true
oh dear the twitter hivemind didnt like team australia my stars wed better drop it then guffaw that sounds like a reason to keep using it if anything has this author considered that the pm might use some of these terms precisely because people like him object so humourously to them and before he successfully achieved it abbotts stop the boats slogan i would actually call it an objective but why split hairs was derided by lefties as an impossible dream it is quite gratifying to see the guardianistas reduced to criticising it on the basis that it merely contains too few words
ive always thought he was looking for the term buttonhole but was too much of a dunce to get there
and even then he falls short scatological is the wrong word for him to have used
slogans are not in themselves bad english or even abuse of the language the abuse is moral slogans gloss over the nasty realities that politicians dont want us to know about abbotts real abuse of english is his incompetent grammar the man doesnt know how to put together a sentence it is his misuse of words stammering delivery and poor sense of which word governs which word that tells us there is something amiss up top the most comic of abbotts misuses are things like shirtfront an australianism with a nuanced meaning in spite of its actual definition when abbott threatened to shirtfront putin he revealed that he didnt know what shirtfront actually means thereby exposing himself as a fraud who wants to make out hes dinkydi like you and me
love the pic of abbott would you buy a used toyota from this guy
i think it was a fair shake of the sauce bottle
common sense those prejudices acquired by age  albert einstein
the speaker and his audience might be free to try another venue but wouldnt you expect that the antispeech activists would follow them and close them down there too experience shows that they do at least in the us
just snowflakes who dont like being called an istlike our famously poor lady mapreader if the epithet doesnt actually apply to them why should they care they should laugh it off if it does they can do something about it if you can learn to read maps you can learn not to be a dick honestly people take offence so easily
noone has a right not to be offended maybe you misspelled the word criticized instead of offended because the former includes an attempt at describing someone or someones actions constructively whereas the latter includes some of those who purposely offend i could even swear so to speak it is described in the law even without imminent threat of violence so on this point it becomes legally challenging to assess the offense on its seriousness and impact on the victim i grant you that it is too subjective to address it in a just manner and depends on the impact on the victim but your point of view is so extremist disregarding completely the wellbeing and selfesteem of the people in the society you live in from offenders who intend to do so as far as i remember teenage mutilation and suicide as well as in the erderly is still a problem in developed countries due to social pressures and indeed verbal abuse among other factors does that trouble you at all freedom of speech is vital for a constructive society however those who abuse it need their own consequences specially the offenders that you seem to stand for
you suspect it but you dont know it
what a load of utter bollox  who says pc is cuddly nice strawman for you to knock down and people are opposed to it for a wide range of reasons a big one is that they are too lazy to empathise with folks outside their little gang
so who should define what society should bei accept i am responsible for myself and i also believe i am responsible for speaking up when i see or hear something unacceptablebut you and i may well disagree about what is unacceptableand how do we decidethat is a huge problem for many
because its a cornerstone of the right wing press constant distraction campaign
remoaner
i personally dont think it acceptable to call a tory a scumbag
pewdiepie made a living from sponsored humourous commentary humour often treads a fine line when it come to offence being very offensive is not usually commercially viable miloy also found this out recently thats just the market speaking thats capitalism try not to confuse that with free speech violation
if something offends me i can ignore it nothing happens enjoyed your comment i think the bit i ed is the crux the implication of the opponents of offensive speech is that words cause actual harm words are violence is a refrain sometimes seen in the pages of this paper and even more commonly its argued that offensiveness leads to implicitly justified violence committed by the offended what makes this such a dangerous road to go down is not so much the impact it might have on me as someone who offends as the infantilising effect it has on those who are offended suddenly unburdened of responsibility for their actions for they have been offended and blowback is inevitable what crime will be too abhorrent for them to commit if the charlie hebdo massacre is any guide not many its why im less interested in criminalising hate preachers than the people who commit violence in their name or aid those who do and its why criminalising a cartoonist as some zealots and their leftist fellow travellers would have us do would be utterly wrong
so why dont we call it what it is some white men are more privileged than other people other white men arent is a michigan steelworker more privileged than beyoncé or than malia obama demonising an entire social group is clumsy and dangerous the notion of privilege is so broad as to be meaningless
tories are clearly neither in a minority nor need protecting from society in fact i would suggest society needs protecting from them
as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing by ordinary you mean your social peers
you are arguing against a straw man
first of all no one outside the dingbat breitbart world of conspiracy theory had ever heard of him until he got shunted off twitter for being supposedly racist milo y had a massive twitter following before he was banned and why would he become all famous for being banned otherwise do you really think the public would care if it heard joe smith was banned from twitter it only made a brooha because he was already well known and he wasnt banned for being racist he was banned for inciting the coordinated harassment campaign against a black female actor in the ghostbusters movie that had upset him so much and speaking of racism as a random example milo sent a tweet to a jewish journalist who had just announced the birth of his child congratulating him on his kid coming out halfblack in the world of altright slurs that means said journalist is a cuckservative who loves to see his wife having intercourse with an african american because he is not man enough himself the same journalist later said the racist and antisemitic abuse went down markedly once milo got banned for me thats worth it
thats a threat of violence which you may take as more or less credible depending on the circumstances its got nothing to do with political correctness or freedom of speech
freedom of speech should in no terms include freedom to insult and use abusive language decency civility and respect should be the basic principles of a culturally evolved and truly civilised society behaviour that violates those principles should not be encouraged or tolerated heavy use of political correctness as a a means of stifling debate and silencing those with different views so long as they are within the bounds of common decency ceases to be a way of ensuring civility and becomes an instrument of repression by the dominant ideology if certain issues are to be turned into taboos and opinions strictly monitored if only those with noncontradictory views are allowed a voice what kind of society are we turning into uniformity of opinion leads to sterility and is not conducive to a free and healthy exchange of ideas which is one of the prerequisites of an intellectually vibrant society
the kkk now back on the rise all ok americans are not free to hate in fact the notion of hate crime in the uk was very much adopted from the us
are you genuinely asking or are you being disingenuous disingenuous how you said i understand which looked a bit vague and playing safe a lot could be said about any country from the safe place of i understand that i was working with female engineers in the uk forty years ago and ive read a report that there his higher percentage of female engineers in india than norway so im not sure if the differences can be simply put down to prejudice
i dont think that would explain equal averages
your comment is a perfect example of the different viewpoints of right v left in your eyes equality is that we all get treated the same i would be all for that but only if we were born into perfectly equal situations but we arent so i believe in kind of compensation of our privilege of birth in practice that means you and me btw have all the benefits of being white and born in the uk but are subject to stricter rules on language concerning oppressed groups or people with less privilege as i man i have even tougher rules to follow than you its quite a good position for us to be in despite the compensation i take this viewpoint to most other areas of life its why i believe in positivediscrimination in job interviews for example i dont think we should all end up equal thats nonsense but its a way of attempting to give everyone an equal chance in life i think homer simpson unwittingly summed it up when he exclaimed its not fair the less fortunate get all the breaks
a comparison of both journalism and comments in the guardian and in the daily mail and the daily express quickly shows that the supposedly pc left is in no way the party silencing the debate atl the guardian provides actual analysis of the issues with some attempt at producing facts and logical argument to back itself up btl there is healthy debate and discussion and the guardians own arguments are often questioned by some of its most loyal lefty readers even on the subject of pc culture and freedom of speech meanwhile the mail and the express produce onesided propaganda and sensationalism with minimal intellectual riguour employed in fact checking etc and btl any attempt at sensible discussion is impossible to actually follow since it is drowned out by the sheer volume of pure bile which one of these two examples do we think is genuinely silencing debate
im quite offended by that photo of hopkins and when i say offended i mean of course repulsed
absolutely fair point but remember that youre in an echo chamber here atl at least
yes it is and i am part greek greeks do not need victim status conferred upon them if any greeks wants to whinge about it well go ahead
subjects that were considered offensive to talk about in public a few short decades ago sexabortionhomosexualitycriticism of religion pretty much every modern liberal cause was once an offensive belief held by a minority protecting people with unpopular beliefs from the oppression by the majority is the whole point of liberalism the term itself derives from freedom whats been so disheartening to see is how rapidly those on the left once gaining authority in any sphere of life employ the same moral shaming to impose conformity that their counterparts on the right have traditionally employed you would think social movements that started as unpopular dissenting opinions would be more tolerant of unpopular dissenting opinions apparently not
but hate speech directed towards tories is still ok
i remember well the video of the woman screaming racial abuse at a passenger and her daughter in london from a year or two back thankfully the court which sent the racist to prison had a slightly more empathetic view than you
if you feel some speech should be censored then as far as im concerned you dont stand for free speech is this intended as a general comment because it doesnt seem to relate directly to the article which isnt advocating censorship
very minor but far easier to address
i think its alright to be islamaphobicno one was ever born islamic its just an opinion
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to behave badly does that mean you actually should you forgot to add and if you do think or say the wrong thing then you will be publicly or professionally shamed or hounded out of your job unless a grovelling and ultimately insincere apology is forthcoming if pc is so cuddly and unassuming why are so many people opposed to it
and i believe firmly that society tends to absolve those who do evil coming amp going as long as they are white says a black lives matter advocate ignoring that  out of  american black homicide victims are killed by american blacks but its an aggression to point that out
easy its free speech hate speech free speech protected speech
because its a word thats been reappropriated by black culture theyve taken a tool of white oppression and put it to use people who can use that word are in an ingroup we in dominant society are in an outgroup a very minor turning of the tables
who decides which words to delete in the name of civility
yes i believe this issue is often missed i may have things i want to say that does not mean that you or anyone else is required to listen to them be they wise or fatuous having an opinion does not mean you are entitled to an audiencesometimes a platform is offered to a speaker but then it turns out that the majority of people affiliated with that platform a university society say or a theatre dont wish to listen to the views of the proposed speaker and here is the bit that draws headlines are indeed averse to their platform being made available to the speaker at all why because the invitation and the opportunity given to express it sends a strong signal that these views are at best interesting to the members or at worst endorsed by them hence an invitation extended by one organiser might be rescinded once many members find out about it and object that isnt a failure of freedom of speech its a community policing what it wants to hear in its own lounge
lets address the elephant in the room this is basically about whether people should have the freedom to hate and to express that hatred people hate all sorts of things mondays trump coriander but being the recipient of someones hatred can be anything from mildly insulting to indescribably traumatic looked at from that perspective its easy to argue that the victims of prejudice deserve to be protected from it but consideration needs to be given to the situation that results from the kind of protection being advocated first we would be brushing prejudice under the carpet rather than actually confronting it censorship puts a lid on things it does not win arguments the prejudice and the hatred will remain simmering away until such time that it boils over denying the freedom for particular thoughts to be expressed also denies ourselves the opportunity to a identify who our opponent is and b argue against those ideas in other words it stifles political progress second it nullifies humanitys moral agency if one is not allowed to hate then choosing not to hate becomes meaningless a decision cannot be considered ethical if it is coerced third it opens pandoras box today youre not allowed to hate a tomorrow it will be b and it will become progressively harder to resist the thought policing because the precedent has been set already fourth it infantilises humanity painting us as animals that cannot tell the difference between right and wrong truth and falsehood consequently fifth it necessitates the authorisation of somebody usually the state to decide what we can and cannot be allowed to hear we are already too far along that road and history has shown that handing the powers that be more control over what we say and think is never in our interests history also shows that freedom of speech was the tool that enabled progress on civil rights in the first place it is both ironic and tragic that those purporting to help the oppressed are now arguing against freedom of speech
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening how about you lost get over it etc
i agree i think the word brexiter covers all of those things without the need for crass insults

because we have free speech doesnt mean we get to say anything without caring of the consequences of that  well actually it does whether you care or not may or may not be wise perhaps this isnt what you meant but the idea that speech should only be made with potential consequences in mind seems like a rather troubling pathway to go down similarly your point about hate speech you dont attempt to define it simply say someone is obviously guilty of it and seem to accept it as a valid concept i dont actually think hate speech is or should be a thing its unfortunate this clumsy term has made its way into the general discourse on free speech matters speech and expression is too subjective to be categorised in such a way and allowing the concept to gain traction gives succour to those who want to constantly push ideas they dont like to the periphery you can have speech which is criminal ie inciting or attempting to incite a crime within our society and i think thats about right other speech should be free

how many instances of abusive language being used dont lead to physical violence as a proportion probably the vast vast majority
it basically hinges on all condemnation being a result of the word used to describe it when in fact the condemnation is for the actions themselves it seems intuitive but this is very well expressed thank you i suspect i may use it in future are you condemning the word fascism or the actions of fascists
i protest some of them are arseholes
i dont think there should be a freedom to offend where the offence is against race colour gender age ability all things that people have no choice over conversely offending someone because of something they chose eg religion politics or football team in the course of making larger arguments should be acceptable thats just freedom of speech and making an argument that other may disagree with
they even pen articles about muhammed being a feminist the eyerolling induced by that one may have caused a few injuries id wager
well keep trying and maybe youll get there eventually

any chance you could moderate your language its highly offensive presumably deliberately so not very becoming at all
i suspect you also dislike generalisation
well as a brexiter where was political correctness when i needed it i find myself and my views subjected to the most insulting offensive and harmful of abuse most especially around here and nearly all of it based on untruth and the worst kind of prejudice apparently im a bigot a racist and thick as pig shit yet no one knows the first thing about me other than i voted leave
no one has the right not to be offended where did you get that idea from we have freedom of speech which needs to be defended as a moral and the right of everyone living in this country i dont like halalkoshar slaughter as i believe no religion is above animal welfare i have a right to talk about it to those who pratice it
its amazing how if you get rid of the pejoratives your description of political correctness just becomes a description of socialdiscourse defenders of political correctness often resort to the straw man that it is nothing more than basic civility it is not it is a persuasion tool trying to transform the world to match the ideas of its inventorsusers by limiting or shifting what is acceptable to be said in the hope that  they will gain political advantage by controlling the frame of communication external effect  they will change people by the effect that speech has on the thought processes internal effect so political correctness is basically just talking

the trouble with the desire to stop micro aggressions is that it probably inhibits the wrong people those who couldnt care less will shout louder and enjoy every minute of it whereas it guilt trips other people into being excessively concerned about these things and potentially projecting their fear of their own inner racist or whatever onto others then there is a risk that they start name calling as we often see btl in the guardian and seeing racists everywhere and both antagonising people who didnt say anything wrong and increasing fear amongst the minority group that the person projecting thinks they are trying to protect by calling everyone a racist you do no one any favours projection is a big problem if you make people scared of their own thoughts they will project that fear onto others this is divisive and makes the problem worse not better attitudes in societies change over time anyway there is a risk that in seeing micro aggressions everywhere you exaggerate the problem and in the process create more problems than it solves
what make me laugh is that katie hopkins has the least respect for her readership after refugees which she terms cockroaches she is a leading columnist on the daily mail she appeared on a morning show where she claimed she would never have her kids mix with workingclass kids and then went into a rant about workingclass british names her readership sun express and the daily mail dont care really as they like the fact she moans about immigrants and muslims
excellent comment and dmks response to it is unwittingly a highlight of exactly what you are saying
if many news outlets have closed their comments freedom of speech and expression is intended to protect you from the government it does not entitle you to a free platform on any web page you visit you may feel the guardian should be a forum freeforall but they evidently dont and its not your decision if the guardian wants to have an official line on an issue thats their choice if they want to promote only liberal arguments they should be free to do so it would be more counterproductive to that aim for them to host opinions that conflict with their values liberalism is not anarchy its i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it not i disapprove of what you say but here please plaster it all over my website i support your right to free speech but i wont invite you in my living room to lecture my family you may think its hypocritical it isnt but that still doesnt explain why you think closing comments on certain articles is causing people to support people like milo interestingly you agree with the author of this article more than you probably realise she wants to be able to stop people acting in a certain way you want to force people to act in a certain way its all the same and its all so bloody tedious the reality is they probably closed the comments because they couldnt be bothered moderating all the crap that would be posted thats fair enough people should post less crap

lets not forget people who experience racist sexist homophobic or any other form of abusive language experience it not as a one off incident but on a regular basis and how many physical acts of violence start with abusive language the nazi persecution of the jews started with abusive words then the words became normalized then they became orders then they became mass murder

 fire in a crowded theatre shouting fire in a crowded theatre is not in itself a problem on the assumption that there actually isnt a fire the person may be merely mistaken if they are not mistaken then they have the intention of causing harm or are reckless to the reasonable probability of harm which amounts in my opinion to incitement of harm
they only have power like all things if you let them and accept that they doif the word is the weapon how can jayz use the n word to describe someone of colour and be congratulated for being cool whereas if i used the same word to the same person he would be upset angry and annoyed and i would be pilloried
all the power lies with people like abi abi jess phillips stella creasy yvette cooper and all the other powerful authoritarians who want to reclaimtheinternet for their own use these people are like victorian social reformers who spend their lives trying to civilise the masses eat less fat dont smoke dont drink alcohol oh and you may choose your opinions for the day from the distributed word list we need free speech to protect us from the state and from people like abi authoritarians in powerful positions as i said we have laws against certain forms of speech that might directly lead to harm i honestly dont think we need any more what further restrictions on us would the civilising tendency like to see

see above freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences the fact that our application of libel law differs from the united states is neither here nor there especially in relation to addressing instances of hate speech

i dont see why a little sensitivity isnt called for on all sides of the political spectrum are rural trumpers resentful of liberal metropolitan elites who deem them stupid being oversensitive snowflakes or are they an impoverished and economically abandoned segment of the electorate who see their communities falling apart and blame others for it there should be the freedom to offend but the understanding that doing so is morally justifiable only in pursuit of a greater principle its not something frivolous that you should employ at every opportunity for a cheap laugh unless youre a comedian people are different you cant dictate what will hurt someone you dont know what its like to be oldpoormalefemaletransgayethnic minorityconservativechristianmuslim respect the difference where you can
thank you for finding and providing that link again and again the journalists of this newspaper often refuse to link to the actual studies they cite as evidence in their articles theyll link to another newspaper article or perhaps the researchers press announcement why do they do this either its because the journalists themselves havent read the study so we get an ever expanding process of journalists passing incomplete and inaccurate information to each other and therefore their readers or they have read the study found the researchers explanation like you and recognised it eliminates the sensationalism by omitting the link the likelihood of readers finding the conflict drops its only those who read your comment and follow the link who get the accurate news ffs the btl commentators become the credible journalist what business model is it where the customers are compelled to undo the mistakes of the service provider
the lack of consent is troubling
you can stop people saying it but youll never stop them thinking it
i despise katie hopkins and kelvin mackenzie since you provided them as examples i find a lot of what they say as offensive and usually poorly thought out i am sure it can also upset a lot of people however so long as they dont breach common english laws of provoking violence or harassment then they should be free to say what they want and we should be able to respond by either not listening or reading or by responding in kind i believe that there is an increasing tendency to close down free speech either through violence harassment or via witchhunts by more powerful entities such as newspapers and broadcasters in respect of the latter the attack of pewdiepie by the wall street journal leading to his loss of income is an example interestingly one of the journalists involved has himself made what could be definable as antisemitic and racist comments freedom of speech is the best way to deal with issues in society it shows up flaws with poor arguments and is a more effective way of fighting against issues such as misogyny racism etc it is worrying that those calling for speech to be shut down in some cases using violence are not being condemned by the mainstream media

chinese does have those pesky tones though doesnt it if it becomes the dominant business language people will have to learn to use them to read a lot of posters in this and similar threads youd think that english was a model of simplicity
that a chair has no gender doesnt change sweeping though this accurate statement is simply because i look at my language or any other that i dont see why people decided to start pasting genders to inanimate objects doesnt change the fact that inanimate objects dont have gender
that should probably be impolite shouldnt it
i do hope that it is not unpolite of me to suggest that brits are being arrogant when they presume to decide what is polite i am only trying to be helpful
theres no point to assigning arbitrary genders to every thing in the universe a pointless tradition is still pointless you might want to have a slightly closer look at the history and development of your own language before making such sweeping statementsjust because you fail to see a point does not necessarily mean there is none
i tried to speak german in germany but virtually every time i opened my mouth i was corrected for using the wrong gender even down to the dative and ablative hmmmto be fairly honest with you even tolerant and morepatientthanasaint me would start correcting you if you were to give me german ablative forms
even when answering a simple question like where is the station a german will correct the gender of station first and then give you the direction as if the gender it mattered but it does to them i beg your pardon are you sure you are not creating a bit of a myth here as far as i can tell the vast majority of german native speakers couldnt care less as to something ridiculously irrelevant as correct gender of nouns but maybe you just had a bit of tough luck bumping into some sort of linguistic pedant
concur with the above i found that reading german translations of terry pratchett books that i knew almost by heart in english helped enormously oddly though i find that i make more mistakes now when i live with a german wife and almost never speak english than twentyfive years ago when i still had quite a lot of contact with englishspeakers getting lazy i suppose or spending too much time on the grauniad
i am inclined to agree
you challenge me to explain english spelling it would take a more learned man than me i said that in my comment
there are gender rights and there is grammar das fräulein is definitely female which if in doubt you can find out if you kiss one the article however derives from a grammar rule about the diminutive the form of the word which conveys the meaning of smallness so das fräulein is a small frau and das häuschen is a small haus the diminutive s formed by changing any gender be it feminine masculine or neutre to neutre and adding an umlaut to the vowel in my opinion one can treat genders equal without having to violate grammar rules
funny it should be kwestschens though
now you see how very important those  gender related professorships are that were installed in germany during the last couple of years indeed predictions vary my personal prediction is that this bullshit will be ignored by most of my fellow germans and in my very humble opinion what mark twain wrote about the german language is an expression of how much he actually liked it
chinese does have those pesky tones though doesnt it
gtgtpie in the sky because casebase languages need gender for the sentences to make sense as the position in the sentence doesnt make it clear who is doing what to whom compare den mann biss der hund with das mann biss das hundltlt what about die frau biss das tier then german doesnt depend on gender at all to express who is doing what to whom it depends somewhat on case rather than word order but this only works with the masculine since feminine and neuter arent marked differently in the nominative and accusative cases in this sense you could say german would be better of if it only had the masculine gender as thats the only one fully marked for all four cases
i dont get all this fuss about being corrected by germansthey are being helpful yet impolite its just as frustrating for foreigners in the uk when brits dont correct themtheyre being polite yet unhelpful
lets let every country on earth nominate what they would like to get rid of in other languagesmost languages survive without articles a lot dont use tenses certainly not to tge extent that english does and lets not even start on spelling

whats the difference between am and pm when standing at a rail crossing german high speed trains go at  kmh especially around midnight i would wait for the gates to go up it its only the local tramline ok but anyway sometimes it is better sticking to rules particularly when coming home drunk from the pubclub late at night cheers
i dont agree with this article at all i also stand with what maxcolour says who is a native speaker even though i have struggled with learning german for most of my life particularly with written german for most of my life to change a language at this stage would be ridiculous and if there is such a big problem with gender articles then why havent people taken a stand with french aswell as somebody commented below gender articles have little to do with the nouns they precede whatever about das mädchen it was explained to me before as neuter before she is a woman die frau i really think it is looking far too much into the language to say that there is gender discrimination going on here yes german is an extremely difficult language to learn but for about  of the time it is completely logical as opposed to some languages who really do not have any explanation as to why some things are why they are if anything i feel there is a lack of knowledge here about the language being displayed in the post as for language vs culture i can only laugh i dont think ive ever lived in a country that so adamantly fights for equal gender rights
none of what you or any of the responders state contradicts the fact that there is no reason to apply gender to objects and that this makes learning such languages as a second language more difficult as a result this isnt a condemnation of the language or the people that created it or whatever neither is it an assertion that the language should be changed its a simple fact and yet people like yourself have taken this as some sort of an attack that must be defended and i must be someone who expect the world to pander to her and none of that is true

that was a small scale spelling reform introduced in a time when literacy rates were low and the rules of english orthography wasnt nearly as standardized as they are today and even then it was only half successful as many of his new spellings never gained acceptance
bollocks english didnt lose its gender system because some politicians decided so neither will german languages just develop
unfortunately it is virtually impossible to explain to a native english speaker how totally and utterly ridiculous and stupid this would sound to a german perhaps you can in a way i imagine it must be similar to how ridiculous it first sounds when a chinese english learner accidentally says he is my sister spoken chinese doesnt have gender specific pronouns or perhaps i readed that books that also sounds pretty ridiculous
my point is that it is pointless and irrational to assign arbitrary genders to objects that have no gender and one could also argue that the so called strong verb conjugations are irrational and tedious to learn but yet i dont believe that many people would approve of saying i eated my food and singed my song would you be in support of such a reform would you wish to change the way you speak and just conjugate all verbal past tenses using the ed paradigm after all it would make english more rational and easier to learn im actually quite curious as to your response to this query
one of the most significant deterrents for me regarding the serious learning of such languages was this need to assign some sort of gender to everything yes quite right whoever came up with those dreadful languages were obviously not sensitive to your particular needs after all its only fair to expect that a language spoken by millions of people over centuries should be tailored to your particular difficulties and so reforms are naturally in order in order to best suit your language learning needs i would suggest that they keep reforming the languages in question until such time as they are indistinguishable from the english language or some other language that you already know that way youll be able to learn them without almost no effort at all and now what to do about that pesky higher level mathematics hmm but it wasnt just the added work it was the fact that it was and still is completely pointlessness combined with the irrational actually it does have a point indoeuropean languages traditionally were synthetic languages that is to say word relationships were primarily determined by suffices such as verb conjugations and noun declensions with word order playing a secondary role in such a system gender classifications play a crucial role in determining the relationships between adjectives and pronouns such is still the case at times with pronouns in the english language to this day for example the girl saw the boy and gave her book to him if we did not have such a distinction of gender the relationships would be impossible as in the girl saw another girl and gave her book to her if you speak like this in english in this instance its not very clear you have to change the structure to regain some clarity in other words abolishing the gender system in german for example would have an even larger impact far from being merely a cosmetic change it would force the speakers of the language to fundamentally alter the way in which they speak the language thats just the way it is neither of which settles well with me in any situation and whats the solution to engage in a massive social engineering project with the aim of fundamentally altering the way millions of people speak their mother tongue theres nothing orwellian about that nope nothing at all
please explain to a non native english speaker why although is pronounced differently from throughdespite both ending in oughif you think english is so easy to speak
one of the instances in which gender would actually be more appropriate
german joke alert was eier hat ist masculinum was milch hat das ist femininum als ausnahme merk dir genau der milchmann und die eierfrau
dunno about the federal ministry but i recently read about something similar coming out of the state of brandenburg
esperanto ridiculously requires nouns to have an accusative case and requires adjectives to agree for number and case for example a big house granda domoi want a big house mi deziras grandan domon the big houses la grandaj domoji see the big housesmi vidas la grandajn domojn no wonder esperanto failed
i see what you mean now i agree with you she must have thought i was another one of those pesky germans she said who cares about the cases i find that comment very strange indeed take the cases away from german and you have a completely different language a complete mess thats not a comment one would expect from someone who said she learned latin years ago
its one of the reasons why english has prevailed when german and french havent masculine and feminine politics you might want to check out the grammatical challenges of chinese
a french man once told me that speaking english for protracted periods actually made his throat sore a french woman once told me that when shed had her tonsils out and had a really sore throat she found it easier to speak english
many linguists question whether language can be changed through human will if they cant do it with german then there is absolutely no hope for the romance languages webster managed it with usian whence jewelry labor etc
there seems to be some disagreement about thatequally sorry
i think twain was joking
my favourite is sopranin for sopran soprano
the lack of gender marking for plural nouns also seems a bit strange considering its importance for singular nouns how come it no longer matters once there is more than one of any particular object
gtgthmm so precise that the same word is used for you she it and theyltlt ah yes thats the other thing i was trying to think of siesie at least as the third person it has a separate verb conjugation t but as you polite and they it has to share the same en ending in fact when it comes to verb conjugation german is rather paltry compared to the romance languages informal second person singular and third person verbs share the ending t apart from some irregular forms while formal polite you we and they all take verbs ending in en the informal you having different singular du and plural ihr forms while the formal sie doesnt also strikes me as somewhat inconsistent
one just has to get ones head around a very simple fact grammatical gender is something completely different from natural gender it is in german and some other languages in english he means male she female and it neither male nor female apart from curiosities you can count on one hand i recommend the system
english speakers start using xe and xem far better
hmm so precise that the same word is used for you she it and they to explain im currently working through duolingo german and really enjoying it this doesnt blind me to the utterly unnecessary inbuilt complications however fifty years ago i learned german in school and just had to suffer it the way you suffer most of school now learning the language voluntarily i see the complications for what they are i fully understand the move to end some of the noun genders
that goes part of the way thanks i can understand why the same endings would be the same gender but i was looking more for the rationale of why one gender rather than another is assigned at all ie why keit endings would be feminine rather than neuter i never objected to it particularly although we were taught languages in an unelightebing rote way heavy on the written word and light on actually speaking the language i still enjoyed it a lot a beginners vocabulary is pretty easy if youre at all familiar with scots thanks for taking the trouble to explain its much appreciated
es isch veil eifacher schwiizerdutsch zlerne
do germans actually care if a foreigner gets the gender wrong when speaking as well as der die das there are also dem den and des for cases its a jungle to be honest surely native germans can understand faulty grammar and wrong genders i know in english our spelling is all over the place due to the mongrel history of the language but at least the spoken language seems simple the more i learn of german the more it reminds me of latin and look what happened to that
interesting article herr oltermann but i would be even more interested to see the discussion taking place in germany the notion of genderneutral language has been batted back and forth for a long time and i would be surprised to see anything concrete actually happening do you have a reference to the justice ministrys edict thank you
yes i was thinking about that a while ago i tend to say mein freund male name when i am talking about a friend whereas leaving out the name when referring to my boyfriend might work only if people know the name of the boyfriend an alternative is ein freundeine freundin von mir a bit more delicate when it comes to plural indeed i cant help but chuckle when thinking about a man referring to meine freundinnen with his wife sitting next to him in this case die bekannten acquaintances should work no gender implied here at all though can be males and females
and read read read and read in german bücher das buch zeitungen die zeitung zeitschriften die zeitschrift beipackzettel der beipackzettel alles
i disagree the languages themselves have little to do with it the wider use of english is much more to do with commerce and its adoption by many worldwide and linguists will tell you that the more speakers a language has native and second speakers both the more simplified its grammar will become the fewer speakers a language has the more its original grammar will persist hence the most complicated languages to learn are actually those spoken by isolated tribes
 points out that some dialects such as niederdeutsch have lost the cumbersome distinction between der and die already in low german for example both men and women are simply referred to as de de utrum and dat neutrum are the genders common in northwestern and north germanic languages ie dutch de het danish en et in low german however the use is as arbitrary as in standard german and not linked to sex or animateinanimate hence dat husthe house but de boom the tree its erroneous to assume the gendered articles were lost at some point in history they never existed in low german and for the cumbersomeness who needs so many tenses when you can very nicely live with two
english a late derivative of the germanic language on the continent im not entirely convinced that this is an accurate way to describe english especially considering the history of english i think it would be misleading to consider modern high german as being somehow the true descendant of protogermanic or whatever but your basic point about german spelling being consistent is true of course
edit the lack of marked case change between the nominative and accusative feminine and neuter
i agree that mostly it is a very precise language ive always thought the lack of case change between the nominative and accusative feminine and neuter presents a potential ambiguity though one that doesnt exist in english english word order always makes the subject and object clear german does not depend on word order in the same way as subject and object can instead be determined by case hence den mann sieht die frau meaning the woman sees the man even though den mann appears at the start of the sentence den shows that it is the object however what about a stand alone sentence like die katze sieht die frau who is seeing whom here a german told me that in this instance german would default to the svo rule and it would have to mean the cat sees the woman regardless this still marks a departure from the mostly consistent precision of the language in my opinion
and her predecessor too
they do indeed manage with san for everyone and also without plurals its great when youre learning the language but less so when youre translating into a language that does distinguish between male and female and singular and plural

the other swabian exception to gender i can think of is das teller instead of der dieder butter is so common the duden lists both as acceptable
i think the reason that ung nouns are feminine is that basically all suffixes that make new nouns out of other words and are often abstract are feminine heit keit ung as well as latinate tät and ion the ung ones generally are derived from a verb
the equivalent of fräulein would have to be herrlein

welli may be going out on a limb here but i think the piece goes back to the mushroom hunterswhat is actually being described is a form of mushroom if you link that to the old superstition that the little people used to come out around fairy ringsusually circular formation of mushroomsand then even the english tradition of calling someone whose masculinity was somewhat in question a fairy
use your ears exercise your memory from the beginning of your year in germany repeat in conversations words and expressions you have heard whenever you think them it appropriate try to get to the bottom of those words which seem not to be in the dictionary also morgen komm ich wieder gel that sort of thing remember too that milk is she not it above all use your dictionary in the quiet of your room preferably a germangerman dictionary the firm of brockhaus used to publish a useful deutsches bildwörterbuch für jedermann dont bother to ask your german friends how they know that is der and not die they know thats all there is to it
ive always supposed that the fact that i started with french when nineand was thus exposed to the idea of gender with the use of definite and indefinite articles and then next to latin with its use of cases and gender albeit without the use of articles made learning german grammar that much easier then toss in the close family relationship of german to englishand it actually was a piece of cake
the youse bit is quite common around here tooabout an hour west of philadelphia i have to admit to cringing when i hear it though
smilesi thought you might be but my point was that eu seemed to think you mustmight be native germani went back and reread her postit must have been thethere you are you just couldnt resist putting me right before addressing the problem that all those genders and cases make german a difficult language for foreigners which led my thought
chucklingtrueon the other handi thought they might have more fun with the bar thingand then in mutual hilaritygo right ahead and visit onei can be as sticky as the next when it comes to the finer pointsbut in realityit is all music to my ears but then i am not only a linguistbut a people person
no i didnt can you give me the link to it
someone once proposed a simplification of english based on the ideas of esperanto i am we amyou am yous amhe she it am theys am yous am should appeal to the scots i think up there ive heard the expression yous yins
there are already enough german jokes on the peculiarities of the language yes a girl is neuter but a testicle is feminine true enough that should say it all the other well known one is you may confuse mir and mich while speaking but dont confuse mein and dein and by the way i think the term gender with its reference to sex is not how language experts refer to those articles der die and das
my nationality im british
yes thats what was meant in the comment above sensitive english sensibel german a simple error based on the pair being false friends shakespeare and austen both used sensible in the modern sense of sensitive the meaning easily affected only dates from the early th century there are lots of english words which branched out from a single ancestor skirt and shirt being my favourite
the only successful example of state dictated change to language i can think of was in 
not sure if my previous reply to this got through english speakers have a myriad ways of avoiding using each others names all of which have regional differences in the north a man might be called sither or simply be nodded atin the south you might get matey or pal in the north a woman might get love or duck in the south anything from sweetheart to treacle never do you refer to anyone as simply mate mate is a special term used to indicate formality used particularly in conflict
my german teacher always used to say that germans love their dogs more than their kids hence der hund and das kind nice joke more seriously the uk had a royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  years before it got a national society for the prevention of cruelty to children food for thought
i think english speakers often find using someones name rather too familiar also so we have a great line in the user of terms of familiarity or endearment and they have a million regional differences so if the person whos name you dont want to use is male in the north of england we might call them sither or muckerin the south you might get matey or palnever anywhere in england do you use mate because mate specifically indicates a refusal to use their namein the us you might use dude and dude is becoming ubiquitous in the uk too if the person is female in the north you might get love or duck in the south you might get anything from sweetheart to treacle the myriad ways the british avoid using each others names is mind boggling 
 a ship is referred to she most languages have some kind of article le soleil la luna la tierra its called tradition articles and gender are not the same thing languages like german or french show gender partly through articles english has articles a the but no grammatical genders although some theorists would count the person vs nonperson distinction of who and which as a gender in the broader sense the concept of gender was originally only indirectly linked with sex if at all languages like russian and latin have grammatical genders without having any articles
i dont know what the problem is i send christmas and new years greetings always to the mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeitern des and what about other languages french italian spanish are the academies there considering such changes luomo becomes luoma for the female human have fun
as any student of the german language might know der die or das have little to do with actual sexual gender worse they the genders just unnecessarily complicate the language whilst adding little if anything does it really matter is your cup of tea or glass of beer is masculine feminine or neuter i would simplify things by using der for singular and keep die for plural the cases can be suitably adjusted suddenly german would be ten times easier to learn and use
this has to be given up to please sloppy people who cant be bothered to learn genders and declinations joining a worldwide race to the bottom for convenience or egality in which english native language speakers are masters judging by how many cant write their own language correctly i dont think anybody is suggesting this at all but just to do away with gender discrimination where the masculine is taken to be the norm my impression is that this is already more or less the case it may be written studentinnen but im always impressed by the ease with which its read out as studentinnen und studenten
say the relatively simple sentence of gehen wir ins bar and listen for the auslaut in the word bar that depends to a certain extent on the part of germany you are in i would rather suggest getting them to name brahms even if an english speaker has learned about auslautverhärtung rad and rat pronounced the same and even usually masters it in practice long familiarity with the english pronunciation of brahms tends to make the final consonant still come out as the lenis z albeit devoiced rather than the fortis s
psi am not really laughing at youbut at that example native englishspeaking students have broken their heads over that one for so longand that is really just a gold star example that if you forget that german is so foreign but actually so closely related to english the problem actually solves itself
the standard reply when referring to she is who is she the cats mother which is intended to suggest that one should refer to a woman by their name which i suppose is fine if you know their name i think this one is british americans seem to use she in that way without worrying about it here in switzerland youre expected to use peoples names and if you cant remember them its normal and fine to ask we brits of course are too embarrassed to ask peoples names but on the other hand we can get by without using them at all
ok i see you have provided the answer further down and i see that you obviously know what you are talking about
i am sooooooooooooooo laughing at you for choosing this particular examplewhy would they change die to der in the dative possibly because even in english she changes to her as in i gave the book to her and in the masculinehe changes to him i gave the book to him that one should be easy for all native english speakers because we have maintained that in our own language so if that ever stumps you againthink of your englishherand remember that german will have the same r endinglikewise think of the masculine in englishand prestoyou have the german actuallyin the singular for feminine and masculine in the dative whether personal pronoun definite or indefinite articlethere is the clue
das polizierende what a monstrosity we are creating to appease this feminist misunderstanding that grammatical gender has much if anything to do with sex as i tell my colleagues when they are tempted to use the americanised gender to refer to a persons masculinity or femininity words have gender people have sex
there are several parts in germany where it is called der butter swabia and where else it is certainly not standard dudens deutsches universalwörterbuch does not listit whereas it does for example include both high german die socke and southern austrian and swiss der socken for sock
german is a very beautiful language theres always oneor is that only one no there are at least two of us and once you get past the initial grammar hurdle its also fun to speak
most abstract nouns are feminine in german typical endings are ung heit keit ei those are islands of safety for us poor benighted foreigners grappling with german genders the treacherous trap is der salbei sage botanicalculinary where the ei is not an ending but part of the stem also das ei egg
ive yet to meet anyone in switzerland whod say marmelade even when speaking schriftdeutsch its konfiture or confiture here
theres a huge problem herealmost anything can be suppressed because it is hurtful to some people for instance i find allmenarerapists articles offensive but i understand that no purpose whatever would be served by suppressing misandry if as is happening at so many universities the shoutiest people become the selfappointed arbiters of what is harmful you dont even have the excuse that suppression represents societal norms even if it did once some body has the power to suppress dissent whos to say what will eventually be suppressed freedom of speech is the cornerstone of a free society and im afraid that these supposed microagressionswhich empower selected groups to prove an offense has been committed simply by claiming to be injuredare only going to serve to inflame resentment and divisions
like many bad things the current problem of intersectionality group privileges came from a good place the concept is attractive but it invites people to define themselves by their victim group and this can lead to seeing all of lifes problems in those terms it sets up enemies in other identified groups and war is waged over microagressions many of which are misinterpreted or over stated ultimately it splits people into ever smaller tribes and divides rather than unites us
the debate about freedom of speech has been won its bizarre that is those who call themselves progressive are now the most censorious among us
also people tend to respond with facts like the gender gap actually being a parental gap or that most young black men die at the hands or guns of other young black men or that more men kill themselves than women or that asian indian or chinese people do better than their white peers and so on when columnists or the papers they work for respond with either ignoring these facts recycling the same faulty premise a few days or weeks later or by deleting the dissenting comments they just compromise themselves no one is listening anymore which is a shame because there are still some real issues being highlighted
to e john scalzi freedom of speech is not freedom of consequences it is entirely right to be allowed a suitable space to be an arsehole but you arent allow to then cry censorship when someone calls you an arsehole
nobody has a right never to have their feelings hurt
i dread to think how much time is wasted by the police investigating people on twitter because someone says something not politically correct or someone is outraged people need to block out those they dont like and remain happy in their echo chambers
there is a right to offend but also a right to be offended and express that offence i think too often in discussions of free speech the latter part of the equation is forgotten say what you like but dont expect no one to react to that too much criticism is swept up with other aspects such as no platforming and actually banning things but theyre not one and the same and shouldnt be treated as such its as fundamental to be able to criticise as it is to offend i also think that to use the term racist homophobe etc is viewed as some abhorrent authoritarianism but if people genuinely believe that something is its not authoritarian to say so and even if its used unfairly at times thats no different from the types of things people defend under the concept of the right to offend i struggle with things like no platforming and calls to ban something or other but i think ultimately freedom of expression encompasses the right to call for something we think is a bad idea or would have negative effects i suppose the key is to challenge whatever we consider to be negative actions rationally and in good faith from whatever politics it happens to stem
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed being white straight and male are protected characteristics thoughi believe it is called equality
while we recognise that free speech should be a protected right to what extent do we have a personal duty to consider the impact of our words on other people people should consider others feelings where suitable but what is suitable is subject to review and discussion we dont just obey the liberal lefts dogmas because we all know what that would entail dont we considerable censorship and coverups some things which the liberal left deem offensive are rational criticism perfectly reasonable subject matter for debate and if others are impacted offended then tough luck
of course you can no one is afforded a platform by dint of the fact they want one
from a paper that routinely uses terms like pale and stale and old white men and is happy to blame older people for things and to imply or even state that their age means they should not be making decision for the nation and a paper that routinely treats dads as secondary parents you seem to be quite happy to use microaggressions stereotyping and prejudiced humour as long as it is used in a way you agree with
units of consumption is now the preferred identity i believe
is pretty much shut down oh behave with the ukip victim nonsense the politicians pander to the immigration minority it is the stand point of almost every leader of a major political party the greatest racist in recent us political history is in power why dont you explain to me how you are so oppressed
bit difficult to question their decisions if youve noplatformed them
hopkins is a vindictive pain in the neck i advocate freedom of speech even for the most obnoxious however platforms of speech is a different variable giving hopkins tv panel debate slots columns in the sun and daily mail is diabolical people find the bluntness refreshing without really realising just what theyre enabling hopkins is breaking no laws by spouting her nonsense but the platform shes been given so easily deserves a bit of counterpressure the logic that says not giving katie hopkins a position of question time this morning and loose women is harming freedom of expression is a redundant argument if i apply that logic i could argue that me not having those panellist roles is harming freedom of expression throughout society id be laughed out of the conversation for saying that kh must realise she is not the centre of the universe and that if the media industry make it harder to find channels to spout nonsense that is no harm to freedom of expression
noone has a right not to be offended if speech leads directly to physical harm or its imminent threat then there is a case for suppression in that place and at that time otherwise as a liberal i would not restrict it at all if you think people should be protected from things they dont want to hear or offend them then you quite simply are not a liberal you dont believe in free speech freedom of expression or free thought it is that simple
its just faux outrage to get the halfwits and bigots behind their political cause if you couldnt say what you wanted within the legal framework of free speech then they couldnt say the shit they do for the brexit generation though they think the respect given to others is pc nonsense gone mad to e their new messiahsad
the trouble with the whole microaggressions concept is that it would lead to people saying almost nothing to anybody we all of us experience microaggressions the driver who looks angrily at you the bloke who wont turn his stereo down the rude shop assistant etc etc every day of our lives its life obviously we should try to be pleasant to people but historic oppression simply is not the determining factor in most peoples lives in britain in 
discussion and debate are the single most important tools in combating extremist ideology by battening down the hatches you isolate that ideology to an echochamber where it can proliferate the end result is donald trump brexit violent religious fundamentalism and whatever else you want to pin on right wing thought to not understand this especially now after shutting down debate has allowed these ideologies to bleed into mainstream political discourse is stupidity when nick griffin went onto question time and made a confused tit of himself it was the beginning of the end for the bnp by giving certain voices a platform you give them enough rope to hang themselves its a tricky balance but opening up discussion provides far more opportunities to debunk and argue against than offering no response at all
fingers snapping
youre so confused on one hand you say freedom of dissent should be protected but you support the idea of no platforming you cant have them both you cant cast some people as censorious but when you disagree with them set out to ban them most of the article reads like pseudoacademic gobbledegook full of big sounding words that actually mean bugger all
the freedom to silence can also be seen as the freedom to harm
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening i disagree debate about immigration is pretty much shut down by accusations of xenophobia or even racism towards those who want to reduce it rules on expression are having a profound effect on this debate the word foreigner for example has all but been abandoned in the last decade the word migrant has even become a bone of contention what words are left to us
oh please its pretty simple if its against the law then report it if it isnt then ignore it and block the user
this unchecked microaggression will not stand
if you feel some speech should be censored then as far as im concerned you dont stand for free speech
guardian journalists are also a demographic that has not historically been oppressed
we have the freedom of speech and we also have the right to remain silent wisdom is knowing which to exercise at any given moment
never yet met anyone who was against political correctness who had anything worthwhile to say on a subject they just want to pour bile onto it
in the past an opinion piece was a one way article the author wrote it people read it and that was it now social media and the internet has allowed a feedback loop an opinion is made and people then respond to that opinion in theory this is good an opinion on its own is nothing it is only with critical discourse that opinions can be modified and made into something realistic or workable filter out the genuine abuse either at the end or start of the process and try to appreciate the valid responses
censorship by the left is very worrying indeed as its a sign that the left is coopting right wing methodology which is basically cant beat them join them so its far from a paper tiger its also worrying when the left dismiss any worries about the rise of censorship and other reactionary views in the leftyou cant beat the the nazis by becoming like themduh
every couple of weeks another article will be published railing against campus noplatforming or leftwingers policing language and proclaiming pompously how vital it is that we should be free to offend but it is vital because if you accept that one section of society can dictate the limits of acceptable speech then that tactic can be used by anyone were seeing that now with the populist correctness where questioning the will of the people marks a person out as a metropolitan elitist suggesting that the people have no idea what theyre talking about is the great taboo besides political correctness and its associated ideas of intersectionality group privileges and all that proved too complex to communicate to the very voters we need to be winning over it failed on practical terms
im alright sweetheart how are you holding up cupcake
dont worry about it man
on another note paul hollywoods bulging crotches mesmerising someone call the police love im sexually harassing a picture of a fully clothed man with my eyes
i think these articles are the guardians contribution to keeping the elderly in touch with young folk a bit like putting students in retirement homes oh how we rail against the new tangled ways of these whipper snappers who visit innocently share their wisdom and then leave it a cloud of patchouli and busyness but secretly we love that these youngsters care and indulge us bonnie wee lassies the lot of them
it depends entirely on whos speaking and where and when this is vital people believe that words are the problem and changing or restricting them will change attitudes in certain cases words are indeed offensive but far more important is the context the register and the intent of what is said people will always find new ways to insult belittle or patronise within what is regarded as acceptable
you can get an early start on the not speaking if you want 
calling people snowflake is genuinely offensive love
out there on your own sitting naked by the phone
imagine kicking off at being called sunshine i could at a massive stretch entertain the notion of gender based epithets being taken badly sunshine though id refer to anyone who hated that as downpour as it would be a lot more fitting
eh
calm down sugar tits
whats that heres mine i c
if you are reading this you are still reading the paper please remember that factoid
ahh the brilliant frank zappa thanks
i just read the headline lol
yes not like that at all silly boy
ive only heard that in the canaries where mi niñaniño is an affectionate term much like luv or duck in englandthe spanish equivalent of girls would be chicas and context is key as the author says the word i notice being used in a deliberately sneering and belittling manner is señorita
what about we just shout oi
so what you are saying is that sometimes its ok and even quite endearing but other times its awful but thats entirely up to you and your mood ok
naturally as a feminist i hate nice things and fun i enjoyed this lighthearted article but ive enjoyed the triggering in the comments even more as the writer points out context is everything and its usually the tone that conveys offence rather than the words being used ive been called a dhead and a see you next tuesday in affectionate terms and it hasnt worried me at all ive also been called a girl or a lady in the most condescending and patronising ways possible its the intent that accompanies the words that can get my blood boiling
as in you guys too americanised
only unwelcome when its being used to deliberately patronise other than then being called love sweetheart and darling are all more than welcome especially since i can be a right baastard at times
see delusions of gender by cordelia fine its well written and at times hilarious like the author im sick to death of studies that claim theres a female brain given the social constraints we are all raised within there is no such thing as a control group for a proper scientific assessment besides women and men are more alike than some would like to believe
read about feminists the new ones anyway
you get the impression that the author doesnt actually give a toss about all this but theres bills to pay and the guardian is permanently into this stuff and these articles write themselves in  minutes so oh well needs must
people really do get offended easily i try to keep my greetings as neutral as possible yet i still get shouted at i mean cant get much more gender and racially neutral than you lot your type your kind can you
rebecca you may address me as sir anything else is offensive for anyone else its the usual annoying stuff please far more interesting
get over yourself
soon we wont be able to say anything without causing a stir as if women dont call men both young and old loveboys or even pet its time we got a grip and focused on more pressing issues
interesting in russia it is commonplace to address a young woman you dont know as girl dyevushka and it is entirely inoffensive address many older women with same phrase and it is termed a compliment
i suppose love would sound a bit intrusive to a country who greet eachother as far as i can tell online with the epithet triggered cuck 
no youre being pessimistic
it isnt a problem except to those who cant see real hardships and real injustice in the world and therefore need to manufacture issues to offend them so they have something to whinge about
it depends on why the familiarity is being used and by whom observing a young and charmless young man calling a sophisticated older woman mdear the other day i was struck by just how embarrassing and awkward it was its probably best to be affable but not familiar with strangers or acquaintances and familiar only when it has been established that all parties feel equally powerful in the dynamic and have invited such behaviour unfortunately this calls for a good personal skill set which as this thread demonstrates is not present in everyone
there are other words that female counterparts might find offensive from angel to sunshine to even woman if you kill these words for the sake of your protection the only thing you as a female would be able to do is watch us guys how we have fun with each other as in hang out and do stuff that guys do feminist or should i say the modern feminist dont stand for equality anymore but for female supremacy and taking down imaginary foes like patriarchy and white privilege they even made alliances with lgbtqxyz the new feminists group that is about less than  of the females yet they scream quite loud
theres no generalisation in this article its a very well balanced article open minded very slightly critical and mostly generous in humour of the terms that some men and women take for granted there will always be men and women who will criticise feminism no matter how things are worded its typically that type of person who seeks to reduce feminism and feminists to a stereotype not because it is that way in reality but because they arent really genuine feminists or the subject matter being discussed or highlighted is something they arent willing to change their view on consider or listen to nor address in an open minded respectful manner
master candidates until graduated bit of a mouthful dont you think
thats very cisgendered of you i myself never use gender in any way having taken all this new social politics to heart i no longer have girlfriends i insist they are my partneri have a persons night out where i will regale my companions with stories where i dont focus on the gender so this individual bursts out of the ladies bogs in a dress six foot two with a beard they were of course due to this insistence i have no mates or a bird so
given that the end of the article mentions crucially of course its all about context that list would have to be sub divided by the different contexts and youd probably need a flowchart as well to follow to the correct sub list alternatively we could all just start noticing intent if someone calls you x is their intent positive or negative if you call someone x is your intent positive or negative be honest
it all depends on the context i use the term ladies when i am talking to women in a jocular but respectful fashion it is cornyi have found that the term guys covers all bases as in you guys
crucially of course its all about context yep
someone farts in your presence and suddenly you feel like a princess how on earth is anyone expected to work that out each to her or his own i suppose
you go careful there now my love alan partridge has ruined my love for me
oh i love guys especially coupled with you of course for me it is what comes naturally i grew up in new jersey so its always been the goto collective noun its so versatile so few words can say so much depending on emphasis guys for me is completely gender neutral where im from everyone is you guys i couldnt stop using it if i tried and heaven knows id never want to seriously guys i love it
why why should we show a little respect the author of this piece appears to have absolutely no respect for regional terms of endearment or i might add the people who inhabit those regions
vive la différencethat being said i told off a man for calling me honey  years ago i was his boss sigh
surely misses
i cant believe that anyone educated enough to be a dean would not understand that lady is the official and correct way to address a female just as gentleman is the official address for men must have been one of those new exlocal tech unis
on the other hand as a woman of certain age i bristle at being referred to with the catchall dudeits an intrinsically american thing and is is utilized like  yall but it still sucks as does  girlfriend  aaarrrgghhand  dollokaywhen addressing me  hey you will do just fine
indeed in derbyshire terms like love and duck or perhaps mi duck are normal terms of address used by both sexes usually to a member of the opposite sex but not necessarily im often accused of playing with boys toys my rc model planes in my play room my workshop im  calling adult women collectively as girls is no different nor more common from calling adult males boys in the right context and certainly isnt demeaning in any way to either sex
careful now
mdear only appropriate for a lady of advanced years addressing a woman her junior
you made my day
im not condescending babe dont worry your pretty little head about it
im enjoying all the comments by people who barely read the first paragraph before rushing to spurt forth their ire theyre my favourite
for men in cornwall it used to be me andsome for women me andsome total equality between the sexes see we were the true progressives
 xxxx gt hope i dont get moderated for death threats
well said
indeed my girl  years old is from the midwest
dont give up we have to fight these types with all our might because they are hell bent on destroying society as we know it
this reminds me of a friend i had from the south at uni telling me that referring to the opposite sex as love was deeply sexist eg if i ordered a pint pint of lager please love odd a man had to say that and i only do it as i echo what i hear that being how language is constructed more or less indeed love is the most positive word i can think of it isnt patronising its a tic of the accent or maybe im wrong heres some words i get called i could similarly kick off about ducksoft ladfella dont gender label me mate from strangersbabe im a grown up methinks you can find offence if you go looking for it
go to the american heartland and they call you hon same as luv up north its just how it is
and just for the record the use of the word babe in the workplace is considered sexual harrassment by the un yes it is from a womenwatch initiative but the language is applicable for both sexes httpwwwunorgwomenwatchosagipdfwhatisshpdf
i read this as a tongue in cheek quite amusing article naturally as a feminist i hate nice things and fun thats a nice bit of self deprecatory writing just pricking the stereotype and the lack of humour in the predictable bah hairy horrible feminists theres no covert man bashing well apart from paul hollywood getting a bit of stick i suppose tut tut its just someone saying she doesnt generally like being called a girl in some situations notably at work but she balances it and stresses its all about context thats a very acceptable conclusion isnt it theres a lot of outrage at the really very very mild almost non existent gently ribbing outrage in the article
i dont mind love dear even hen or pal
gawd another article by a snowflake there is a fundamental difference between men and women thats a fact so get over it
on tyneside it is pet lamb i was in my forties and the lady in the shop was much younger but i was a pet lamb much nicer than sir
shes of a generation that grew up on the sterile medium of text shell be offended by an emoji as much as being called love
masters
i remember when i first moved to england northwest it sounded so weird to me almost offensive i got used to it pretty quick and twenty odd years later i still use it while in the usa
and so you should
god arent there more important subjects than this for guardian journalists to write about
love itwill try to use in a sentence every day for the next week
be offended and show concern for things that are genuinely offensive and really need to be addressed
it cant be sexual assault to call someone love unless you are being threatening as an earlier poster wrote its all in the context
oh dear yes of course its all absurd really the guardian needs to grow up seems that we need rushbridger back to get our balance dont we boys and girls
as an example of what i mean i heard of a church minister who said something along these lines to his congregation during his sermon  children under the age of five die every day mainly from preventable causes and most of you dont give a shit he paused for effect before continuing and i know you dont give a shit because you were more offended that i said shit than you were by the fact that  children under the age of five die every day mainly from preventable causes
shush darling it aint so bad sweetie
if this is how pathetic things have got now then it is plausible that humans or at least the opposite sexes will stop speaking to each other all together in future unless its completely unavoidable you will have to go via the digital screening process to check if a compatible interaction is possible with this other being if not you simply walk on by if it sounds familiar its because this is almost the reality now sad but true
indeed same when i go out with the lads
righto i call them grllzz and boyzz
i absolute agree with you about applying the same rules ive also worked in an office where i was the only man and experienced similar to you it isnt okay to call a man deary at work anymore than it would be to say the same to a woman my point is that it just takes a little thought thats all it shouldnt require anyone to become militant about it and the author isnt saying it should i dont agree that its offensive to all or offensive to none because it does depend on the circumstances when the tea lady calls me luv i like it when my boss says it i dont but thats because shes being a prat context and intent are intertwined as im sure you agree so removing it from the workplace could make a big difference to everyone and positively so
when i read stuff like this i am reminded why i will remain a rightwing tosspot
if you overlay your own insecurities on everything that people say then you will see nuance that isnt intended and take offence where it isnt necessary
down with this sort of thing
and in that brief passing moment i felt like a princess  a princess why so maybe this explains why these terms are used and will continue to be used
completely agree if my wife goes out with friends its always with the girls who are between  yrs old 
im making very clear sensevery real matters of importance are being shoved aside to make room for whinging about nonsense nothing to do with multitasking its about being fed manure when nutritious food is the real need
i used to live in sheffield and got used to people male and female calling me duck its just a term of endearment
why be so conservative if you define it broadly enough you can get that figure up to 
i went to university a couple of years ago as a mature student to do a masters the course was  female i discovered that if you refer to a group of younger females as ladies they dont like it generally and think its corny they actually preferred girls im just not going to bother talking to anyone anymore ive lost the map
it isnt a problem
could you just say what you mean i was pretty upfront in my response to you so i dont know why youre responding with vague riddles
to be called a girl in a work situation feels infantilising to me because its a sign of an assumed imbalance of power really i thought it was more an assumption of imbalance of ability
in cornwall me andsome
if you need to ask the question i think you need to read the article and maybe read up on the issue i mean how long is a piece of string
the british constitution is largely unwritten dont you know on the contrary its not written as a single document but by thousands upon thousands of individual statutes all of which are written down in painstaking detail along with the interpretation of those statutes by courts of law
there isnt any gendered language on turkish national anthems i think there is a mistake in reference
i hadnt realised that the anthem used otechestvo отечество having never really listened to the words but i find it interesting given that i thought rodina pодина or motherland was more commonly used when referring to russia
because if there was a king the song would change the relevant words luckily the ones you highlighted and the tune and pacing ect would stay exactly the same 
how is the uk one gender neutral again is queen now genderneutral
i agree its an absolute bleeding dirge not only that but most people dont even know the words and sing god save our queen instead of god save the queen makes me cringe
i dont know about the most sexist national anthem but the least sexist has to be the marcha real the spanish national anthem which was written without any lyrics at all there have been occasional attempts by whoever is in power to insert lyrics in it but theyve inevitably fallen out of favour shortly after whoever was in power has the last example being the reversion to wordlessness following the death of franco in  its hard to get any less likely to be accused of singing any sexist lyrics by even the most hypersensitive guardian columnist when youre not singing anything at all
perhaps chalrles would keep queen and just add and me king charles after it if he has a queen in mind whom he really likes
when they sing god save the ginger queen you will know the apocalypse is nigh because the gingers have no souls so how could they be saved
you can say humankind and in italian i suppose gente or is that spanish it might seem odd to an english speaker but some languages have gendered nouns and the gender holds no great significance the italian sentence in question uses the word hands feminine and hearts masculine humanity can be translated as umanità feminine or uomo masculine
we should be more concerned with vegetables rather than countries when are we going to move away from the concept of countries
and any native english speaker should be able to tell you that the words man and men can refer to humans without regard for gender this is an absolutely key issue and of course you are right man and mankind often mean human anthropos rather than andros but the change that has taken place over the last  years or so is that many people now believe that the word man whatever its intended meaning invariably evokes only the idea of male human beings we dont seem to have any trouble with parallel language conventions for other species we know when dog refers to any representative of the species and when it means male dog in contradistinction to bitch many people use cow as the generic word for all cattle even though its primary meaning is an adult female member of the species personally i regard earnest attempts to impose political correctness on language as a dubious exercise as far as national anthems are concerned i think that if changes are required they should focus on jingoism rather than perceived sexism just look at all the verses of the uks national anthem just as well we usually sing only the first verse
dont give them ideas the urbanized version is not yet written and already it is worse yo

and seemingly without ever managing to turn one over bank of england banknotes have only had portraits of the great and the good since  whereas theyve only had the current monarch on them since  well into the reign of queen elizabeth somehow the whole bunfight managed to be about it being gender equality to have women on both sides of banknotes

not sure what is critical about the underlying assumption that jingoistic nationalism should be gender neutral
if britain had a king the g would then describe the national anthem in this case god save the king as sexist there can be absolutely no doubt about thatyou must surely also realise this so dont pretend otherwise
true but youre missing the point the fact that these languages use the masculine to refer to all genders says it all you can say humankind and in italian i suppose gente or is that spanish
what is the most sexist weather
well you could make it so bland that no one even cares about it anymore
this article was in the highlights section wtf are the guardian doing you are a news paperthis is not news its not even gerbil bedding
forgetting gender neutrality for a second is it time as billy connelly once suggested to change the tune of the british national anthem to the theme tune from the archer
sorry whos smug again
language itself is often bias and discriminatory this occurs so often these days the noun is bias the adjective is biasedso i see a bias in these attitudesi see biased attitudes it seems we have a bias against the adjective oh the topic erm some languages have a notion of gender and when those gendered pronouns are used it can be biased i mean if its the fatherland then it will be biased towards masculine but only if you think of grammatical gender as something other than a grammatical feature but then again if its all sons and fathers ra ra ra then it is a real bias d
italy may be feminine but every man has the heart and hands of ferruccio in the song of the italians the italian ognuom is a contraction of ogni uomo uomo meaning man mankind or humanity its your translation thats gendered and any native english speaker should be able to tell you that the words man and men can refer to humans without regard for gender
which is the sexiest national anthem
i think they must be including all verses the star spangled banner is shown here as being slightly more male and yet the only reference to gender appears in the fourth and last verse which i presume no bugger ever actually sings to sum up then who cares
more than one reference but i fail to see why its in a separate class of sexism to the australian national anthem
a gracious and noble king no less i wonder if anyone will be able to sing those words and mean them
at last an article which debates a truly urgent issue i do hope the canadians will also remember to make their national anthem representative of their diverse wildlife and include references to moose polar bears grizzlies etc

amen surely to god there is something more important to worry about
the french version of o canada is already more gender neutral than the english there are no references to sons or daughters but plenty of references to us and to ours terre de nos aieux protégera nos foyers et nos droits which makes it hard to understand why such a change to the english version should be such an affront to tradition
i dont believe in god or in a monarchy shall i start an online petition
some of the guardians writers got far too much time on their hands

australias sons became australians all some time ago in the dark ages when i was at primary school i cant recall a reference to daughters were australians not expected to read the article

i read through the turkish national anthem in turkish and it mentions sons only once the only gender specific word in the english translation it is however repeated much more i also read through the australian national anthem and sons are mentioned once and fatherland once so i dont quite get how these results were achieved
what do you recommend does posting a comment about it count as time wasted on shit or is it part of getting a life i would value your guidance
gah bbcode 
no im not your barometer for critical thought must be pretty low if you think totting up gender pronouns and questioning whether vaterland man or mankind constitute sexist language is on par with foucault is mother russia a matriarchy is britain nice ad hominem by the way
rodina is not mother russia it is actually family russia although it could be gender russia i suppose
gstq is not britains national anthem in any other way than by tradition there is nothing in law that says britain or the uk has a national anthem at all

ive found it annoys canadians if you sing the lyrics to their national anthem to the tune of ithe starspangled banneri
who really cares bar those who make it a lifelong commitment to worry for everyone else their used to be professional god botherers now it is equality nuts who probably count the number of grains of sugar in a teaspoon to ensure they do not give more to a man than a woman

its a nice waltz tune if only it wasnt played at dirge pace
well yes but that still makes it  years older than gstq no never mind the point is that its ridiculous to be criticising century old anthems for being sexist
god youve really lost the plot now

john key is trying to make the flag of new zealand an election issue one which i thought was missing the real issues but judging by your error im now not so sure
language itself is often bias and discriminatory the first time i read the word quite possibly in this very paper i thought it was just a mistake but its starting to take over now certainly online and im starting to loathe it the adjectival form of bias is biased constant improper use of the former is making me annoyance and irritation

the dutch national anthem is two hundred years older than god save the queen
exactly what i was thinking the guardian said last week that there were  genders which means we need to see this graph replotted in dimensional space so see the true story
jerusalem should be and thats that
due to the guardian not having a simple way to list columns by date printed could you point me towards the empowering selfies article sounds like a laugh

the canadians seem to be concerned as that is what the article is all about the fact that other countries are mentioned gives the piece a bit of context thats all you dont see it that way of course do you
el niño
because it switches to god save the king next time around gender appropriate rather than gender neutral
japans islamic shit were in trouble
but family in russian is feminine noun i think that should be addressed as well
but nations are themselves a masculine concept we dont need national anthems but an international music that crosses all boundaries of culture and it should be the music of the flowers and the music of the trees music of the womb and of lunar rhythms oh and of whales mustnt forget the whales
the lyric refers to land of our fathers whoever they might be
you cant say anything about queens in the groaniad yknow thatd be homophobic

although i think o thus be it ever when freemen shall stand should be freepersons to truly qualify and the first verse is so full of phallic imagery it is almost embarrassing
this is an important article when those anthems were written testosterone played a larger role in human society these days societies are becoming more feminine with every passing decade the rise of the machines means that we dont need testosterone like we used to and i welcome this new order so yes let us reassess our national anthems
hes already said that his regnal name will be george
basically the current russian national anthem is a modification of the hymn of the soviet union with many of the words transferred directly rodina is not mentioned in either version although russia is credited with creating the soviet union in the latter
just realised i repeated what you said only i wasted more words to do it
how on earth can god save the queen be gender neutralanswer up
a tune that my sevenyear old could better true although someone pointed out the other day that its a waltz and if you play it at proper waltz speed it ceases to be such a tedious dirge and actually comes to life a bit i think we should definitely speed it up
worth pointing out too that the french version of the canadian anthem does not have the offending line english true patriot love in all thy sons command french ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux
when i came to live in catalunya in the mids typical political rhetoric used els catalans to refer to both genders and in the spanish context there was the similar use of los españoles within a few years these had changed to els catalans i les catalanas and los españoles y las españolas though the universal forms continue to be the default in common use if you insist on terming these instances of pleonasm id disagree i see a semantic differential here in that eg in the catalanas case this doesnt transmit woman not man but woman as opposed to manadditionally what strikes me as most interesting is why this change has occured in the contexts of catalunya and spain but not in portugal
the issues the modern left has time foronly yesterday in this very paper a writer was regretting that the modern world has robbed women of the opportunity to have nice long baths yes when you see the scale of problems that the patriarchy has left us you realise that the bottle of radox scented candles and tori amos cds will just have to wait
with the scottish referendum i did have high hopes that we could dump our infantile ditty once and for all but sadly it wasnt to be i am frankly ashamed of our national anthem its bloody awful oh i dunno flower of scotland isnt that bad
freemen in verse  also the whole rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air thing is a tad phallic or maybe thats just me
which reminds me of an old polish scifi comedy where the world presented is ruled by women and the main characters attempt of clarifying that copernicus was a man is met with shock and disbelief
no one in nz sings the second part of the national anthem generally so the first part is almost enitely genderneitral
can there have been a more inane article ever published on this website its getting worse by the day inanity heaped on inanity whether it is trying to paint a racist angle onto everything or make everything about gender bias does anybody really care about whether the wording of national anthems is gender neutral why does everything have to be gender neutral cant we just accept that some things are slightly biased one way or the other and realise that it just doesnt matter
until the queen dies and is replaced by a king
one of the great guardian headlines though i think you guys know it you teases
oh thus be it ever when freemen shall standits in the last verse sickening concealment of the patriarchys evil agenda
well if the soldiers were singing it after fighting for unification it wouldve made little sense for them to refer to themselves as sisters
unless you sing it in your fatherland that balances it and what if in my native language we dont say mother tongue but father tongue
at least the walls will be an nice shade of beige

some languages have gendered nouns and the gender holds no great significance exactly i blame the modern tendency to use the word gender as some kind of euphemism for sex in languages where all nouns are masculine or feminine there is an absence of the english tendency to confuse the two
because they stand and sing it to a flag pole another phallic symbol of misogyny
and since all men come equipped with a tool of sexual oppression id say thats material for at least two articles knives up
land of my fathers that should be mae hen wlad fy rhieni a neu warcheidwaid lets start a stupid campaign
there is not a single gender pronoun in the star spangled banner so why doesnt the us rank a gender neutral
the issues the modern left has time for the middle class is eroding the working class is seeing a drop in living standards more crime more poverty etc but the most important problem is genderspecific pronouns in national anthems
so whats your point lots are missing colombias is pretty much gender neutral in the bits that are actually sung but the rest of it is heavily male orientated heroes soldiers with their manly breath references to bolívar ricaurte and nariño the virgin gets look in in a very passive sort of way but theres no room for independence heroines like la pola happy now
i think you miss the point in english too the masculine is often used to include the feminine in words such as mankind and his to mean his or her etc which has been criticised as sexist and we now attempt to avoid such usages i once had to write a set of guidelines for teachers in order to avoid the sheer bloody inelegance of page after page of heshe and hisher i simply stated at the beginning that the st rd th and th chapters would refer to the teacher as she and the nd th th and th to the teacher as he of course as i am now presumably supposed to factor in transgender ambiguous gender and other gender teachers this solution no longer works
its becoming unbearable
ive a theory that the guardian will forever reaching peak levels until it folds in on itself and all the hummus in its offices explodes
for so awarethatwearenotsuperiorinanywaytoanyothernation we stand at the twilights first gleaming

the article didnt read as all that critical to me bar the click bait headline which everyone ought to have learned to ignore by now it reads more as just a piece about gendered historical legacies that we tend to take for granted as part of everyday civic life
my god is there nothing the g cant put through its relentless gender obsessed middle class illinformed mangle its all getting very silly
well you shoulda seen the cover they wanted to do it wasnt a glovebelieve me
for what its worth rule britannia definitely comes out as more female as though most of the words are genderneutral like britons britannia is feminine so are the nine muses and guardian angels are sexless that makes  female references to  male references
i was addressing the point of whether gstq is sexist which in my opinion it is noti fully concur that the guardian is written by idiots who view life through a microscope of identity politics and who will find sexism or racism in anything larger than a proton
yes i always thought it was mother russia
yeah but music is a patriarchal construct
i think that the repeated references to brothers of italy might be what makes the italian national anthem gendered random fact the italian national anthem refers to poles and the polish national anthem refers to italians as far as i know thats the only such pairing in the world
beside the fact that national anthems often arent gender neutral or species neutral or nonreligious the biggest problem is that most are so nationalistic stating that that their own country or people is best so lets start a campaign to make all national anthems nation neutral
its good to see the guardian is keeping the really important issues on the front page ye godesses
indeed i have far more problem with the inclusion of god in all these ghastly tunes than any latent sexism
i dont know about the most sexist national anthem but the least sexist has to be the marcha real the spanish national anthem which was written without any lyrics at all oh dont worry the guardian will find something sexist about it
this is just a stupid issue some languages are gender biased due to their on costruction that does not mean that their use by people are gender biased for instance in portuguese she is ela he is ele and it is ele thus all genderneutral things are usually referred using masculine pronounsso the portuguese national anthem is male biased according to the guardian why because it speaks of heróis do mar heroes of the sea instead of speaking of heróis and heroínas heroes and heroines but that would be a pleonasm do the journalist know what that is because in portuguese when you refer to both male and female one uses the male wordfurther on there is a reference to pátria fatherland is it biased should it be motherland but in portuguese we say a pátria the fatherland and not o patria which means that the gender of the word is feminine odd isnt it so stop talking nonsense about biased national anthem our languagesi guess in italian something similar happensenglish like other germanic languages has neutral gender pronouns it happens that many latin languages do not have them yu can not compare them so be rational please
more likely to be the descendants of those conchies happy to let others defend their country
i doubt it theyre rather on the young side
it changes with the gender of the reigning monarch
peak guardian again
argument for uk national anthem being sexist against men what makes the queen so special argument for uk national anthem being sexist against women cant she save herself
no but nor is king so eventually they balance themselves out
and they carry plague according to the guardian ych a fi
why is the mascot brat in the english clip clenching his fist against his chest thats what americans do isnt it
id like to know that too or the most suggestive rude or lewd
yeah come to wales where our national anthem refers to the ancient land of our fathers and never mind our mothers bless em
because it would be his majesty if we had a king
what happens when youre patronised
i like being called love when im up north its nice friendly and feels very inclusive
context context context if a sheffield bus driver calls me a woman in my s love no problem he or she will say the same to the man behind me and not get punched if a wellspoken professional man says it especially if im in the south east im probably being patronised and if a much younger person says love or much worse my love theyre probably doing their talking to an old person thing and im going to get very cross the article has encouraged a lot of misogynists to crawl out of their burrows and make revealingly stupid remarks there is an issue sometimes but it depends entirely on whos speaking and where and when blanket offencetaking isnt helpful neither is dismissing all objections
beauty is in the eye of the beholder offense is in the ear of the snowflake
of course she isnt there are no cheap political points to be scored by commenting about another culture
surely unless youre talking about actual children its accepted that girl is the equal of any of boyguylad hes a great guy shes a great girl im going out with the boys im going out with the girls utterly harmless and the only thing thats a bigger waste of time than this very comment is the article im commenting on
yes the era of the minority interest coming out on top often to the detriment of the majority
she suggested that gendered terms are not useful and that boys as much as girls are constrained by them boys and girls are constrained by gendered terms but she used the term girls even though we shoudnt use gendered terms if we didnt use gendered terms we wouldnt be able to say who is being constrained by their use would we
is what precisely the problem
youre not making sense ive noted ops points but touted that multitasking is important not sure how that doesnt cover his points
i certainly would agree that he isnt noble i should have said that if honesty was the issue he could have said so which is even more honest than an apology which only came because of the subsequent bad publicity for him youre right sometimes the mask slips to me it seemed more deliberate than that i suppose i think that the more importantsenior the position the more responsibility for better behaviour
needless to say our relationship was difficult ill bet it was what with him having to walk on eggshells all the time
isnt that precisely the problem
super interesting i am a teacher and hate that our teaching assistants are often referred to as the ladies even though we now have a male ta it creates a weird separation in the job role from a teacher i also am proud of the fact that i am a teacher in the south and call all a mix of love darlin mate even bruv for the cool kids i think we can break down these patronising terms by applying them equally 
that gets the attention of the whole class not a group within it you can always get an answer from within a question if you dont mind stripping it of context and the answer being to a different question entirely
so whats your point its ok for a woman to call a man deary at work is it or to say ooohhh you are a love for that thats just fine both sides are equally guilty and im afraid that until thats actually addressed then the entire argument is simply one sided and biased both genders use stereotypes to describe the other its either offensive to all or its offensive to none at all you cannot have one rule for and one for another and trust me i used to work in an office where i was the only man make no mistake if men had spoken about a women the way they spoke to and about me every last one of them would have been dismissedyou either apply the same rule to every person or you dont apply it at all
could you turn your mind to more pressing matters like genderblind poverty nationalist populism climate change drowning migrantscould you could you pet
and there lies the problem
is she saying that more of an indictment on men i think
you would absolutely hate it in spain where they refer to women of all ages even in to their s as nina and the same applies to men referred to as nino are you saying that the culture of spain is offensive
come on this is surely a nobrainer for guardian readers when is a term of endearment not welcome when its uttered by a white male
sorry rebecca you are just making a joke out of serious issues women are not the softies emotionally that you seem to picture them
right mate thats up there with people who say that soandso cant be a rapist hes too good looking and if youre not a teenager youre certainly old enough to know better
you should first ask me if im lactose intolerant before offending me with your non subtle microagression
how
try being called mate all the time sick of it whys that then mate
i think in a sense youve gotten further through this process than i have but words can seriously do harm especially if they successfully convince people around you that you deserve to be treated poorly and obviously i dont think youre condoning bullying or anything
men we dont know what we did
could we have the officially approved list then i dont want to be accused of wrongspeak we have it sorted in australia doesnt matter if theyre male female other everybody is mate
and me duck in parts of staffordshire at least the parts bordering derbyshire
yawn meanwhile in sheffield old blokes call each other love and no one takes offence maybe the girls should do what the boys do
i dont want to drive a wedge between us but i always wanted a birdie and then i got a hole in one
but in a world where acting like a girl is an insult and acting like a boy isnt then it is a problem i see a lot of articles on the theme of why men are whats wrong with society men are not in the happy comfort zone that you think they are yep you are right context dependent friends calling each other girls fine boss or career rival calling making me seem immature not fine fully agreed and its probably a lot more to do with a general patronising or dismissive attitude than the word girl if me and a bunch of other male colleagues got back from lunch and a female colleague said hey the boys are back this wouldnt bother me i assume similar applies for women whereas if your workplace is full of alpha males who keeping saying things like great the girls are whining again that would obviously make anyone see red
just use everyones name saves remembering  plus peoples preferences ive yet to find the person offended by being called by their name
because hes not noble he realised he did something that made him look bad so he apologised when he did that it probably just slipped out in the heat of the moment ims sure hes not like that all the time to womens faces although he may be thinking but sometimes the mask slips
when gt of women continue to suffer sexual assault i think youve just reinforced ids point
care to give me an example of particularly masculine terms i cant think of any because men dont feel the need to message each others egos the way women do men will greet each other with words like mate as you say which is simply an acknowledgment of friendship they dont use words like babe honey gorge thats another one which are words designed to give the recipient a feeling that they are something special which seems to be a major driver in female relationships pandering to each others ego
the nitty gritty connection to slavery is probably nonsense confected and historically illiterate outrage whoever picked your wife up on it was in the wrong not least for not bothering to study the facts of something they purport to feel passionately about
not entirely sure hes to blame for the bbcs admittedly absurd pay gap and most of the article was listing things that are clearly fine like calling boys in school boys
as a male in the north of england ive been addressed frequently by females with the terms love darling and sweetheart over the border in scotland ive been addressed as hon short for honey these terms were also used by both males and females towards my elderly mother to my mind if these terms of endearment were more widely used wed have a happier more cohesive society
hey i was badly bullied at school and belittled in front of the class by teachers and it was horrible but now i dont care what people call me or if they try to patronise me because if they feel the need to do that then its problem them that has issues and theyre just words its irrational to fear words or be upset by them unless someone is threatening you of course you could argue that i am condoning bullying or harassment but im not i think those are things that are relentless that distract you and should be stopped and some people especially the young or vulnerable who are not able to just dismiss abusive words should be protected
its the moment some kid says excuse me missus that lets you know girlhood has past
im not sure about this im from manchester i cant imagine not calling someone love or mate its not meant to be possessive i think its purely meant to sound non threatening and friendly or at least it is in mancs
i bet you have them rolling in the aisles down at the golf club
but im wary still an collating notes no harm in that
i dont think lying is the issue although i agree that he showed his true self if that were the case why did he apologise he could have nobly stated that he was just being honest although he clearly wasnt being honest about all his opinions on the floor of the commons why that one in my opinion the situation demanded that everyone should have been addressed equitably whether he respected her or not her argument was the issue not his feelings about her
bird chick hen why do men assume women are fowl
different folks different strokes as long as the luv or babe doesnt follow show us yer tits i really dont care i think girl is probably a regional thing and happily not heard very often round here
for goodness sake there are thousands and thousands of women in this country worried sick about feeding their children or paying the rent migrants with no papers women relying on food banks women in bed and breakfast accommodation with several children in one room and you are worried about being called love give me strength
very wise of you i must say
if theyve said aww you feeling okay sweetie on the other hand i find it impossible to be the peacemaker you do know everyone will start saying that to you now i love this from steve hughes the comedian talking about being offendedhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvces_jkkjigo
huh what if he wasnt
this really is piss poor its like the tony parsehole skits in viz
shutting down sexual harrasment at work makes me a twat yeah right i guess you dont get much
i understand that in finnish there are no gender sensitive pronouns id be interested to know if they ever existed in finnish and if they did what effect their extinction may have had upon literature this may be off the track of the article  no they didnt die out they just dont have them finnish is a socalled uralic language and one of this familys defining features is the absence of a genderspecific pronoun one interesting thing though the neutral finnish pronoun hän has been borrowed by trendy swedes into their language recently and is now used spelt hen as the english equivalent of she alongside the usual words for he and she off topic though
i had to firmly ask a schoolteacher on a ski trip with kids i was the barman at the hotel in france to please not call me love she was really grumpy about the whole business im sure there are plenty of other comments pointing out that men get called pet names by female strangers too darling babes handsome gorgeous sweetie etc this is something that goes both ways its not just men drunk females in groups are the worst i mean awful im a feminist so i understand these issues better than most personally i dont usually care its in the tone anythings better than you or as any barperson or waiter will confirm clicked fingers or a whistle that just means you will be acknowledged with eye contactand then ignored the teacher who called me love was being showyoffy so needed straightening out politely i dont think much of this article bit desperate really
as a man id just like to say please correct usme men will never learn the ever moving guidelines of what is acceptable or not please dont accept complimentterm of endearment and then complain behind our backs i promise i will do my best to remember the preferences of each of the  women i know and the same number of work colleagues etc its a tough ask but im willing to try love
yep you are right context dependent friends calling each other girls fine boss or career rival calling making me seem immature not fine
im in deep shit its a universal term of address i use for most family members and loads of colleagues
i got called darling by my head of department last thursday he seems to think dragging out the first part of it to make it daaaaarling makes it a funny workplace endearment im counting down the days until he retires
i think the crux of the biscuit is accidentally farting good night boys and girls
babe vs squire you really believe there is a comparison
why the hell do you have to feel weird if youre being sincere youre only in disagreement with a newspaper article you silly boy
going back some years abt  when i had just been appointed dean of law one of the faculty patrons at an official university function in his opening remarks after fulsomely praising the accomplishments of my two male predecessors concluded his remarks by saying and now we have a lady dean to say i was furious doesnt begin to describe it and my remark when he returned to our table was something to this effect i aint no lady but i sure as hell am dean needless to say our relationship was difficult
it depends entirely on context who where and why
at work im a teacher theres no need for any sexual context it only makes the job more complicated not your comment in particular but the replies ive recieved are interesting to say the least men are just supposed to ignore this sort of stuff it appears
how is that relevant
so glad i cancelled my subscription
if we lived in a society where women and men had equal opportunities and life experiences it wouldnt be a problem but in a world where acting like a girl is an insult and acting like a boy isnt then it is a problem
a man working for an institution that has been hugely criticised for the massive gap between male and female presenters calls his female copresenters girls at the start of an article that contains many other examples of using terminology that belittles womens status in the workplace
no its dogistbut doggy wont mind 
feminist i can do anything you can do better anything you can do i can do too me i make a bloody good sandwich and give it to the person im talking to
yorkshire people would be more likely to say love pet is more geordie
you should have asked me for my offence card before posting you could have avoided offending me
not offended by any of the above but youre still mixing your analogies again your original complaint was a woman using a feminine term to address you the equivalent is a man using a masculine term to address a woman
no need to be so sensitive its only a whoosh
or northants me duck
youre right i wont go to hr but im wary still an collating notes
yeesh
and they bloody well shouldnt what are you a  year old have you progressed to adulthood or have you not developed suitable coping skills for the adult world
and still we cant resist supporting the guardians clickbait strategy we must console ourselves that at least we arent paying that monthly fiver
youre right as i typed that i did find myself thinking in fairness being tortured would obviously be way worse agreed my point was more that belittling someone is the most socially infuriating thing anyone can do in arguments online i can find common ground with someone after theyve called me a pathetic wanker or whatever if theyve said aww you feeling okay sweetie on the other hand i find it impossible to be the peacemaker
good one
what if he was gay
would you be offended if a male till operator called you mate i very much doubt it but thats a poor analogy what if they called you gorgeous would that be acceptable or dear dear is a synonym of precious incidentally
is this some self loathing season okay have an opinion and if you dont like girl love etc etc then say at the time and i hope they refer to you differently but i just dont get the importance of this i think men view the term the boys as an affection term my missus i checked and she said shes okay with that term and prefers it to the stuff wife calls me and our  gender males her boys and we like it so go ahead and persue the issue but do it for you and leave those who in the scheme of things to worry about to their views and terms of affection she also loves her big willy and the twins but thats another subject matter right there
actually he wasnt in the least bit creepy nor did it sound it but he was brought to see the error of his ways and with difficulty changed his vocabulary i think everybody felt better by the end and experienced a learning curve
or of a certain age apparently its also vile andor disgusting that men over a certain age should have any sexual desires at all and im not talking about weinstein
oh nobody else does then
im my s for christsakes how can i be a son  i doubt hes insinuating youre his son other than that every male is someones son even if they live to be  its not that weird its not offensive and its not even illogical
dont mention the war
no freedom to say whatever one thinks is the cornerstone of freedom if you dont like what i say challenge it disagree counter argue my thoughts are my own and i should be allowed in a free society to express them so long as they are not accompanied by illegal action nor incite illegal action
the administrators and protestors at us universities have tried to stop ben shapiro from speaking when there is nothing offensive in anything he says his only crimes are that he is a conservative and an orthodox jew whatever happened to free speech and debate on campuses
the problem isnt so much political correctnessthe belief that you shouldnt label categorise judge people based on gender race religion its that the agreement to not do that was pissed away by the purveyors of identity politics who do only that its very hard to maintain the good manners of political correctness when the main stream and new media is full of dear white people killallwhitemen and pieces justifying violence against political opponentsas long as theyre the right sort of political opponents if we want to live in a reasonable world the first behaviour we need to moderate is our own and we need to understand that if you put two racists in a room one white and one not white they dont balance out its not matter antimatteryouve just got a room with two racists in it same with sexists
just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should this is indeed a neat summary but the inverse also applies just because someone shouldnt do something doesnt mean that they shouldnt be allowed to
also people tend to respond with facts like the gender gap actually being a parental gap or that most young black men die at the hands or guns of other young black men or that more men kill themselves than women or that asian indian or chinese people do better than their white peers and so on when columnists or the papers they work for respond with either ignoring these facts recycling the same faulty premise a few days or weeks later or by deleting the dissenting comments they just compromise themselves no one is listening anymore which is a shame because there are still some real issues being highlighted this is an excellent point i would also add to it that editors and journalists also had far more responsibility to write truthfully about topics even if it was from their own biases nor create obvious clickbiat and attention seeking articles now the news media is saturated with columnists desperate to promote their political beliefs regardless of how often the facts have been presented to them it is then followed by poor and inconsistent justification attacking political opposites is challenging them defending political bias is due to disagreements are just hate a lack of self awareness or critical analysis is obvious everywhere
are you saying progressives are so feeble they can be turned by arguments in populist tabloids by rabblerousers
yes i am so clearly not in touch with the latest usage of people who base their understanding on american websites but i dont see how that invalidates my wishes
i have not none of the gay men i know have i never hear it used in real life but i do read it in the media more and morei dont see how a small group of activists in the cities can decide for the whole community to change our label and when they do if they keep being told that many of us dont like it surely they should listen
no saying something is harmful is not in itself to call for it to be banned we must be clear on that distinction otherwise youre essentially engaging in what you complain of labelling speech in itself as harmful ie in that it is a threat to our liberty
sorry but we have seen preachers of hate on question time and interviewed on the tv and by my standards they are far worse than katie hopkins
good grief trotting that one out againcan we have an example thats relevant to at least the th century
sure and then lets play that game where we join an extreme rightwing internet forum and egg them on until an immigrant or a proimmigration mp is violently attacked
the problem i have with this is the notion that we must all trundle through life never facing harm or being injured in any way its the same mentality that forces children indoors or stops us climbing trees in case we fall out on the face of it sensible stuff but it sadly stifles life and new experiences however risky they might appear words can hurt absolutely the same as falling out of a tree but they are both part of real life so get real and move onto your next road made of best intentions
some people like to offend and some people often the same ones like to be offended usually because debating the issue is either to hard or too boring a pox on both their houses
the opposite of poitical correctnes is downright rudeness do you really want to live in a country where people lack politeness no it isnt with the term political correctness the entire point of its existence is that it is not the same as correctness by definition its an adjustment a departure from simple correctness political correctness is the use of socalled islamic state every time the bbc mentions them the forced addition of redundant words to make some people feel better when calling them by their own chosen name would perfectly suffice if you think political correctness is about politeness you have not understood what it actually means and its distinction from actual correctness
when we end up with the likes of burchill and tatchell attacked as bigots and campaigns for safe spaces trigger warnings and irrational fury over a statue of cecil rhodes then we know the lunatics have taken over the asylumnow most of the above is comical rather than dangerous but it must still be challenged
i find it amusing that you can refer to a large section of people who disagree with you as juvenile trolls then a few paragraphs later talk about a how words have realworld effects irony is alive and well at graun hq it seems
if you dont know a single person who opposes political correctness without being a frothing racist i think thats more of a reflection on the company you keep than the entire absolutely massive group of people who oppose political correctness for varying reasons
remember you are not responsible or intelligent enough to think for yourself
to tell you the truth i dont care about your microaggressions and how offended you are the left has gone from a freedom fighter to a fascist in less then  yearsi have a right to say whatever i want as long as i dont call for violence i can say that transgenders are simply having a mental issue i can say that gays should not marry and can say that i dont want to help any of the refugees you are more then welcome to debate any of these issue you can call me an idiot but you can prevent me from speaking the right wing speakers in the universities that are being shut down time after time is the perfect example of what the left have turned into
riots and violence by left wing agitators i had no idea must have been a media blackout perpetrated by the majority left wing press
you better check your microaggressions brah 
in my experience people who claim that you cant talk about immigration never fucking shut up about immigration
it could be the point is that being liberal means hearing things that you dont agree with and then discussing them rationally whilst accepting you will never change everyones worldview it doesnt mean shutting down debate and censoring contrary views thats an authoritarian approach not a liberal one
words are not and never have been violence and the moment you start allowing words to be policed you are on a slippery slope towards a shutting down of democracy thank god this insane era of political correctness is finally coming to an end
the distinction between offence and harm seems useful if i question as rushdie did the reliability of the koran that will undoubetedly offend if however i call moroccans scum as geert wilders did it is more than offensive it is an invitation to harm moroccans
the war on microaggressions will be fought and won by macroaggressions
no thats only a slippery slope if its accompanied by a call to ban something it is thats why its being recategorised as harm open up your eyes and meet the world freedom of speech must also encompass the right to say this is what i think the effect of your speech is i cant see how it cannot im yet to find a single person who disagrees with that youre naive if thats what you think the point of equating offence with harm is
but the point is that the people who are being noplatformed are not simply trying to grab the platform they have been invited by others who want to hear them and want to give them a platform and their free speech is being curtailed by the noplatformists
absent of state intervention it can only be up to us as to where the lines are and to make the case for them
its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of brexit and trump are partially the result of this form of social censorship you dont get rid of racism or sexism through limiting free speech you just push it underground where it festers and eventually blows up and the greatest evidence for this is the extent to which the nondeplorables did not expect and were surprised by the trump and brexit votes
but noplatforming is not the same as dictating the limits of acceptable speech you have the right to free speech you do not have the right to a platform
you are arguing for the dumbing down of ideas which are too complex for the masses on the grounds that they are impractical whilst simultaneously arguing against the tyranny of populism not sure youve thought this through
if you think that words cause real harm can we conduct a little experiment ill punch you as hard as i can in the face then you can call me any name you like well keep repeating this sequence me punching you and you insulting me and well see who gives up first
milo y isnt the best example of someone inheriting the earth seems there are some limits to what even the most ferocious of free speech warriors are allowed to say even amongst their supporters
but i thought the whole point about the word queer was that the gay community had reclaimed it
with all due respect abi the freedom to offend in my view something worth protecting isnt even the frontline of this debate as it is we have enough trouble with the freedom to use logic we are living in such a toxic agenda riddled age that the ability to deploy reason and objective analysis is characterised by those whom it inconveniences as an instrument of privilege rather than a feature of enlightenment lets get to a point where reasonable arguments are given a reasonable hearing first then we can think about how the right to be offended now excercised with unvarnished zeal should be compensated with the right to offend
microaggression huh is this what theyre teaching our youngsters these days no wonder political correctness is being closed down pathetic grow a pair ffs
how is that ok for the guardian to do but not for people on the right to do i am assuming you are middle aged that is probably the answer to your question
hasnt that word been taken by the lgbtq community though im not saying its right and im sorry youre offended genuinely but i know many people describe themselves as queer
the balance of power is important even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impact right wing views are literally banned on campuses at the moment riots and violence by paid left wing agitators have tipped the balance too far to the left
the opposite of poitical correctnes is downright rudeness do you really want to live in a country where people lack politeness
political correctness has suffocated freedom of speech for many years and continues to do so it should have no place in our society unfortunately only a few politicians are prepared to stand up and say what they mean we know who they are and many are vilified for so doing the bulk of todays very inferior career politicians will flow with the wind and simply to align with the politically correct
in other words let us control you you will be happier
the politicians pander to the immigration minority its not a minority according to yougov but perhaps you know better httpsyougovcouknewswhywelikemigrantsnotimmigration
no thats only a slippery slope if its accompanied by a call to ban something freedom of speech must also encompass the right to say this is what i think the effect of your speech is i cant see how it cannot
the issue with this is that once you hand that power over you cant get it back were seeing a similar thing with trump right now people were far less opposed to the vast surveillance networks employed by the us government because obama was in charge of them people were less opposed to executive orders travel bans and so on when obama was doing it then suddenly trump gets into power and we realise that the people in office arent always going to be on your side and everyone panics a similar thing applies here you are happy with the restriction of speech now but what happens when the people doing the restricting arent in agreement with you any more are you going to do an aboutturn on the subject and embrace the transparent hypocrisy or will it be a case of grinning and bearing it i suspect itll be the former im frankly shocked that anyone could think that driving unacceptable speech underground and surpressing it is a good idea anyway do you not remember what happened with nick griffin on question time people were mad at him being given a platform then the anger disappeared because his appearance on the show rendered his party a complete joke it was basically the killing blow essentially if youre not worried about facing your ideological opponents in an open and fair debate which you shouldnt be presuming you hold that youre in the right and theyre in the wrong theres no reason to think that stopping them from revealing themselves is a good idea is it not that simple
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should no it doesnt but should it be criminal to do so no it should notfree speech is just that so long as it is not an incitement to physical violence then it is the system we have to live with defamation law is there to protect those who have been defamed we do not need more laws to regulate what should be a right
because it stifles free speech you try saying anything bad about mo on guardian opinion
ive never met any of those people and it wasnt referring to this subject but to those who people who despise political correctness usually want to rail against race relations gay rights gender equality etc
microaggressions stereotyping and prejudiced humour as long as it is used in a way you agree with guardian httpswwwtheguardiancomtvandradiofeblatenighttvhoststrumpgolf the issue of trumps obsession with playing golf also came up six times in  days he said that does explain the bumper sticker on air force one id rather be golfing and theres a  chance that i am his aides have claimed that he could in fact be on the course for something other than golf he could be on the course for any reason colbert agreed we know he loves making fun of peoples handicaps
sure you mean even more orwellian
freedom of speech does not equal freedom from consequence shout fire in a crowded theatre and your probably going to be arrested or beaten up
thats probably because when the comments are made in mass and in often intemperate terms it can come across as being hounding as per that article about camilla long yesterday so it gets ignored
worse than that microagressions are very dependant on the prejudices of the supposed receiver an article here a couple of years ago claimed that a white shop assistant was rude to the atl writer because she must be a racist therefore microagression when for all the writer knew the shop assistant could have had her cat put down at the weekend or a million other life occurances that the writer was blissfully unaware of resulting in said shop assistant being a bit pissed off but no they were white had to be racism without any hint of irony
i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening look at what is going on is uk universities and safe spaces universities for crying out loud places that used to be places open to free discussion
us poor old progressives nobody listens to us nowadays its such a shame as we really are more intelligent than everybody else and if they let us run the world again everywhere would have peace and light blimey the grauns full of it today more than usual anyway
hahah yeah no one talks about immigration its never mentioned in the papers or by politicians im assuming theres no refugee issues or travel restriction policies and no one taking issue with eu free movement as these things amp opinions on them are never in the news quite the shut down
i am a gay mani grew up in the uk where the word queer was used to make homophobic attacks on me and other gay men and on men and boys suspected of being gayit is to me a hate word that every time i hear or read it being used to describe gay men feels like a microaggression is even a little traumatic it brings back memoriesi have commented to say this below every guardian article i have seen using the term and always had people agree and often not been the only one making the pointthe guardian has chosen to keep using the termhow is that ok for the guardian to do but not for people on the right to do
noooope if you go down the road of offence harm the slippery slope is clear to the point we wont be able to say anything anything can be offensive to someone is it really that difficult to carry an idea to its logical conclusion
good point
charismatic speakers can be convincing regardless of the merit of their argument particularly if theyre telling enough people what they want to hear if this is true theres something wrong with our education system
the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trollsa very short sighted statement i find that those that are extremely concerned about erosion of free speech by the regressive left come from all political and socioeconomic backgrounds indeed critics of microaggressions are as diverse as the people that this bizarre concept aims to defend and a second e just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should it is interesting that in the payout sentence the author of this article has assumed all positions counter to their own come from a place of stupidity rather than offering any useful insight about free speech this single sentence gives us a very good idea about the rise of the altright and how they harness the default superiority in the language of the regressive left to catalyze the spread of their extremely nasty brand of sanitized bigotry
obama too authorised such operations moreso with drones but because he said the right things he was considered to be a nice guy exactly i dont remember a potus who was really nice
you cant dismiss the effect censorship will have in an academic environment it may have limited impact at this particular point in time but the suppression of diverse thought in young people will lead to serious consequences down the line
i struggle to believe this given that this comment is sitting below plenty of older comments which oppose political correctness and have something worthwhile to say on the subject looks more like youre deliberately blinkered to me
any notion or idea that people try to talk about that doesnt fit in with with the lefts ideology immediately labelled and designated as being outrageousnasty etceven whenas with the referendum resultpeople manage to have a say on an issueand the left losewe have entered a post truth eracouldnt possibly be that they have misunderstood peoples problems and concernsbecause heywe are right
possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of however uk universities are a special case they are required by uk law to protect the free speech of their members and of any speakers invited by their members the relevant uk law is in the education no  act  where s says every individual and body of persons concerned in the government of any establishment to which this section applies shall take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members students and employees of the establishment and for visiting speakers  the duty imposed by subsection  above includes in particular the duty to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that the use of any premises of the establishment is not denied to any individual or body of persons on any ground connected withathe beliefs or views of that individual or of any member of that body orbthe policy or objectives of that body in other words the university has a duty to ensure that any of its members can invite whomsoever they wish to speak on the universitys premises regardless of the views to be expressed this right of their members to invite speakers is an entirely separate question from the matter of speakers invited by the institution itself as an institution
id like to see an even more closes loop where the writers of opinion pieces actually engage with the comments btl
this isnt an argument to ban things but the reason why nick griffin did badly is not because his ideas were bad they are but he has no charisma or eloquence charismatic speakers can be convincing regardless of the merit of their argument particularly if theyre telling enough people what they want to hear katie hopkins and milo yinannapolous have bad ideas make bad arguments but have enough force of personality enough supporters and enough media executives willing to pay for controversy to propagate those bad ideas
a backlash against politically correct language the backlash is politically motivated reactionary ignorant and fetid for all its faults political correctness is a massive improvement and will only get better with time
the socalled antifa movement in america were pictured burning a pile of trump books the other day its as if selfawareness has abandoned us and the world has just become satire of itself
exactly there are already existing laws against life slander and racial abuse
the horrid horrid americans have a much better definition of free speech you can say anything in the usa antisemitic anti muslim its all allowed antisemitic people are marginalized in us society in general its much more successful than the uk version part of the support for trump was that obama had difficulty saying muslim unless it was accompanied by peaceful
im from the generation which drew attention to the inequalities of power embedded in apparently harmless words mother in law jokes  you guys as a term for mixed company the different connotations of master and mistress we insisted on ms as the female title equivalent to mr ie one which didnt indicate whether a woman was married or not and thus dictate a mode of treatment that seemed to me both useful and reasonable refusing to listen to contentious speakers especially at universities on the grounds that they might hurt somebodys feelings does not its intellectually damaging teaches students to avoid anything they dislike or dont understand and is the precursor to totalitarianism not to mention that its infantilising an entire generation
ohio state knife attacker abdul artan was taking a class about microaggressions its just an easy way to herd people into a fake victim narrative with very bad social consequences the mainstream media have lost the battle on the truth front time to start censoring
unchecked microaggressions against women yesterday the guardian published an enthusiastic article about the modest fashion revolution with hijabs and long dresses and long sleeves getting the haute couture approach for muslim women as a lot of commenters pointed out a this implied women who dont wear such outfits are immodest b the whole concept of modest islamic dress is that women have to cover up to prevent men losing control of their sexual urges thus making women responsible for mens selfcontrol not men themselves thus contradicting some of feminisms and the guardians core beliefs
the thing is you get frustrated with my tone but you have nothing to say to my points if i was wrong on brexit then you could convincingly point that out
i respect this writers decision to open up the comments on her article to some point she clearly believes in freedom of expression and right to reply unlike the guardians three preachy if not tabloid condemnations of conservative mouthpiece milo y this week where comments were closed there you have illustrated exactly why provocateurs like my are currently inheriting the earth though perhaps there is more hope this morning from a journalist speaking for a younger generation
its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of brexit and trump are partially the result of this form of social censorship you dont get rid of racism or sexism through limiting free speech you just push it underground where it festers and eventually blows up also i have to say that this article particularly the last paragraph demonstrates precisely the smugness and superiority that winds people up about political correctness
but everyone has a right to exist which is something that the far right online nutters should take heed of
i would take issue with the idea that censorship on campus is not something to be concerned about it is in higher education that our next generation of politicians academics advertisingmedia professionals and journalists will come from as many of us know our years at university are usually a bedrock for our political and social outlooks it is often said that these snowflakes surely a very tired term by now will get found out in the real world without pausing to think that maybe the world will be of their making people like to belong people like to fit in and when you are in an environment where you ltigtexpectltigt everyone else to be super sensitive its highly probable that youre going to do what you think is expected of you take the nus that seems to have taken its eye off the ball about matters such as rogue landlords and tuition fees and has taken it upon itself to have its say about israelpalestine this is what happens when a vanishingly small collection of students gets together and selfreinforce convinced that they are right this is where you will find the people who go straight into ngos or to an internship at an mps office so it is absolutely necessary to be vigilant about campus life as an example i work in advertising production i know without sarcasm i know just how useful my job is and recently when producing an ad a new employee queried why there wasnt much diversity in an edit i said she was right and id take a look through the footage and see what i could do she then asked whether there was some legal guideline that had been broken i said no and in all likelihood people might say its not very representative she is a really good wicked smart person but in this instance it showed to me how people can internalise such attitudes and automatically think that what they advocate is the law or should be that is a concern and it isnt fear mongering to say so
well said
freedom isnt free no theres a hefty fuckin fee
and you cant beat the hard left by becoming like them either they are two cheeks of an authoritarian arse
but as long as kelvin mackenzie and katie hopkins are still getting published in hugely popular national newspapers its precisely because people are fed up with a large portion of the left being so far up their own arse that these people get attentionyou dont see how political correctness can be dangerous i refer you to cases in rotherham and sweden where police didnt go after rape gangs out of fear of being labeled racist its not just right leaning politicians and internet trolls as you try to convince yourself that see this as harmful its also a growing number of liberal minded people on the left like myself they have woken up to the fact that as long as pc culture and identity politics are allowed to survive in mainstream discourse people like trump will continue to win elections
 fire in a crowded theatre
the basic principle is that nobody but nobody has a right to not be offended
the nurture assumption shame it is demonstrably wrong
suggesting that the people have no idea what theyre talking about is the great taboo its not taboo as i read it hear all the time with you being a proponent i suggest it is lasy narcissistic thinking to fill your day believing that others dont have a clue what they are talking about but you do there are people out there that have forgotten more about the topics you claim to know about than you will ever know they could accuse you of being ignorant where do you draw the line in what is ignorance and what is not that was a rhetorical question because people such as yourself have conveniently placed yourselves above the ignorance bar
if we dont have the freedom to offend then we dont have freedom of speech if what youre saying isnt offending someone then your speech isnt controversial it wont be attacked it doesnt need to be protected and the entire concept of freedom of speech is rendered irrelevant if i say something and you tell me im offended then im still waiting to hear what your point is as christopher hitchens said or something similar you have a right to feel offended by absolutely anything you do not have a right to never be offended because you have a right to be offended by anything no matter how trivial offence is entirely subjective and frankly who cares if you are offended it doesnt do anything its not a vector for illness or actual harm i heard a comedian make the joke i was offended by that and in the morning i had leprosy it doesnt mean anything to be offended if something offends me i can ignore it nothing happens as voltaires arguments are often summarised and the e is often misattributed to him i disapprove of what you say but i will defend tothe death your right to say it when did we abandon this foundational principle of a liberal society for the vacuous censorious autoethnographies of the perpetually adolescent

what stands out for me is the silence of those who proclaim to be defenders of free speech particularly where they have previously defended milo im not sure that the implied accusation of hypocricy is fair im comfortable having watched the edited livestream that he did not say anything that could be fairly construed as supporting paedophilia the topic of the age of consent is one of somewhat arbitrary line drawing as evidenced by the different places that different countries draw that line so it must be ligitimate for the arguments about both sides of that line drawing exercise to be heard otherwise the line would always drift in one direction only there is also a distinction between making a case for one aspect of a discussion and having that determine ones overall conclusion ie argument x suggests such relationships may be ok but argument y is a more powerful argument for their being harmful so i dont have a particular problem with what he said and very much doubt that to pick an example entirely at random someone like owen jones would either im more interested in the shape of the events that have unfolded i agree that those that have been silent over this are being inconsistent but why is it because they are conservatives with a problem with discussing homosexuality this would seem odd given that it has been a large part of his public package i think it more likely that they are more frightened of being labelled accomplaces to child abuse than accomplaces to mysogeny or racism this is not unreasonable the convicted racist has a pretty hard time of it the convicted child abuser gets it much worse and as i have already stated i dont think that milo is guilty of advocating child abuse yet he still gets trashed as though he were this makes it highly risky for anyone else to stick their neck out under the axes of people that have already shown they cannot be relied upon to behave reasonably so to me someone has been publickly attacked in the press by people that know that what they are writing is a deliberate misrepresentation and confected outrage that is a concrete example of the abuse of power over an individual outside the realm of law that is frightening
possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of it isnt a handful of incident its loads of them being reported by academics is the us and uk which come from the left and the right of the political spectrum the threat here is relegating universities from places where youre challenged to something where only certain opinions are allowed which isnt good for preparing people for the world outside of education theres a debate to be had about how we think about and define free speech but as long as kelvin mackenzie and katie hopkins are still getting published in hugely popular national newspapers its largely academic that brings up what is hate speech and we then get into troubled grounds because theres no doubt that these two indulge in hate speech hopkins especially as she makes a career out of it mackenzie as far as im concerned shouldnt have the platforms he has as hes a public figure whos been outed as a bad source at least and as for hopkins id count her in with other hate preachers which brings up the point as to where free speech becomes dangerous if we draw a line and all societies do then someone like hopkins is radicalising people towards the far right but in a society do we let her say what she does or not its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed true but in the uk theres a lot of very privileged media commentators who dont recognise their own privilege especially with class take this paper for example how many of its commentators went to private school or oxford or cambridge how many got a job because they or their families knew people working here or are employed purely because theyre a relative of one of the staff that though is blending into another discussion commentators rail against the largely imaginary threat of censorship because its easier than acknowledging that the world doesnt revolve around them yet government censorship exists weve seen since the s civil liberties being chipped away and were now lumbered with a government wanting to ditch universal human rights i dont think censorship is at all an imaginary threat the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should well quite because we have free speech doesnt mean we get to say anything without caring of the consequences of that
statisticscheck the number of commentators here defending pc with this argument
im offended simply by having been thrust into existence without having any say in the matter
while we recognise that free speech should be a protected right it isnt in the uk and the rest of europe where you can be jailed and fined for a mean sounding tweet or facebook posting to what extent do we have a personal duty to consider the impact of our words on other people none
try this i dont like michelle obamas dress it makes her look ugly that is a criticism and would not be considered offensiveif i did the same sentence and said it made her look like an ugly n that is offensive your stifling of free speech through political correctness is not that at all its trying to get people to realise that throwing around racial slurs is not acceptablecall someone whatever you like just dont bring in their ethnicity colour or religion into it for instance you could call me a stupid fucking idiot for this comment yep thats your free speech call me a stupid fucking yid if i were jewish we have a problem
just what about courteously phrased factbased communication would censor you try writing that sentence again only this time so that it makes sense then ill consider answering it
its also ironic that the so called left are the most violent u mean like the far right mass murderer anders breivik or that scum bag who killed joe cox and then there are all those far right football hooligans brain dead generalisations from people who use phrases like the reality is but who are in fact totally disconnected from it
its so wonderfully guardian that a debate about what things should be subject to greater censorship gets bogged down talking about bellends joking about women being shit at reading maps and not the hyperreligious talking about how their holy books give them special dispensation for holding all manner of truly troubling beliefs its amazing how the censorial urge is so quickly blunted when one suggests that perhaps the pulpits the source of so much heartfelt bigotry and prosecution of almost every ism and ist one can think of ought to be the first port of call but no katie hopkins said a thing
theres getting offended by something you read which perhaps you cant know until youve read it then theres being offended by general views you know others hold even when theyre not actively expressing them which is less forgivable however what we have today is a culture thats utterly appaled by a president saying hed grab something a few years ago but is perfectly happy to defend the morals of a religion that believes you have a divine right to beat your wife its a contradictory position so all this pretence around the morals of free speech is a little premature
eh this article reappears all the time political correctness isnt about not being offensive it is about setting the limits of discourse and prohibiting thought and speech it decides what ought to be offensive not being able to use racial epithets is nothing to do with political correctness deciding that somebody is a racist because they said coloured people instead of people of colour is
yep you can be as shitty as you want to straight white makes just dont come crying when you need the internet invented a bridge built or a moon landed on
you think manners are facist
when people say white males have privilege over others this is what they meanyoung black men are  times more likely to be killed by the policewhite people commit the most heinous crimes but black men are stereotyped as criminals white males are more likely to commit mass shootings but are usually described as a lone wolf or suffering from mental illness whereas a mass shooting by a muslim is described as a sign islam is out to get us all white males are more likely to be paid more than their counterparts black men are nearly  times more likely to go to prison than white men saying there is white male privilege is not saying that every white male is financially better off than everybody else its saying that no matter what there social standing is they are more likely to get an easier ride they are less likely to go to prison they are less likely to die at the hands of the cops they are less likely to be blamed for the actions of someone with the same skin colour they are more likely to be paid more than their equivalents
you appear to be confusing the right to hold and express opinions with the content professional expert opinions will carry a market value because people do have discernment but the right to an opinion is an equal right which we forget at our peril if we value freedom
so terrorists can incite terrorism all they want in your freedom land thats what the birther ayatollah trump is doing against americans right now but i suspect that you are only for the right to speech with which you agree what about a terrorist imam trump or otherwise who calls for large murderous riots which then happen that riot inciter should suffer no consequences i have a better plan free speech so long as its not a lie and if its fiction it must not be represented as truth the birther lie was not free speech it was sedition the muslimer deathpaneler etc ad nauseum lies were purely seditious rabble rousing lies designed to grab power by inciting violence and cultivating radical extremism telling such lies should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of parole and if thats too harsh i think the death penalty would be a good plan b for lying seditious traitors and terrorist rabble rousers look what has happened because the freedom of speech was taken to the absurd we have a bunch of bozos who believe lies over truth and brag about that fact if the birther ayatollah had been imprisoned fr his seditious lies america wouldnt be the laughing stock of the weld right now putin is laughing his russian behind off the one covered in the birther ayatollah kisses birthers have been programmed to prefer lie to truth and then believe that lie with the zeal of an al qaeda terrorist being a birther yourself maybe you can answer the question of why do birthers hate america so much and why do birther worship the likes of timothy mcveigh and vald putin nevermind i expect youll tell a another lie its how birthers communicate the birther ayatollah has told more lies than truths but draft dodging donny thinks that if he pretends hard enough his lies will magically become truth and if that doesnt work trump will just start killing people until his lies are believed i hear the birther call to prayer duck whistle quacking to dueling banjos better run now
things people complain about being censored though are dumb disproven theories on eugenics and why they cant yell at the bloke across the street because hes brown without someone calling them a knob if they had something to say which wasnt regurgitated midth century style handwringing about foreigners then i wouldnt mind but theyre like people demanding that the earth is flat and then complaining about political correctness when people tell them theyre wrong and have been proven wrong waaah dont censor my idiocy the more people who peddle this crap the more it proliferates amongst the intellectually lazy
what if someone is actually being homophobic islamophobic or xenophobic and the label is merited what if they arent
those who rail against so called political correctness are in the main reacting against criticism of their own racist sexist homophobic xenophobic antisocial or otherwise irrational views sometimes usually its people who are sick of being forced to put peoples feelings above the truth
what balance the balance between trying to be respectful of others and deciding you dont need to because you have a right to be an arsehole and thats apparently enough reason to be one quit it with this just because something is between two points doesnt mean its better
i agree that the more you seek to repress the hotter the internal resentment becomes i do not condone really offensive languagei try never to use itbut to call it a hate crimeyes crime is pretty stupidwhen people are silenced problems festeralso if you are daft enough to accept a stereotype about yourself and do nothing about it map reading is a good example dont spend all your time blaming society get off your bottom if it is really important and change it at least for yourself
oh and if you object to me you are a snowflake that cant take criticism i learn from the best you see best at unfounded claims

i suggest that you read a bit on the history of political communication and propaganda you will see that pc bears a remarkable resemblance in both motives and methods to tools used by totalitarian regimes including what g orwell was writing against also please try to analyse the article atl you will see that it advocates for much more than the naively assumes hey people just be civil to each other
dont forget hideously white
i would imagine most people have been on the receiving end of abuse the question is whether the problem is just in the particular words the abuser is using or the fact they are an arsehole who is just going out of their way to make your life a misery
defenders of political correctness often resort where are the statistics to back that claim or is it one of those ipulledoutofmyass researches
the author complains about the  microagressions  of the right while conveniently ignoring the fire bombs and violence of the left cf berkeley et al thankfully the sheer hypocrisy of the left has sparked a revolt which has already cut the ground from under their feet even though they dont seem to have realised it yet
offending people is surely not something we as a society should hold up as some kind of shining example i mean it happens all the time people say really hurtful things about someone else or a particular group of people but accepting that it happens is a whole world away from giving it the honourable badge of freedom of speech a much misused term these daysand it doesnt matter whether you feel the object of such offence is too sensitive that is not your call to make it is a bit like seeing someone stub their toe it is their toe not yours so if they howl with pain you can take it that they have been hurtwe all say hurtfuloffensive things to loved ones to family to colleagues nobody is saying this is not permissible as i said it happens but it isnt nice it isnt a right it is the wrong thing to dowe tell our kids this all the time why is it so different when we become adults
if hillary benn had made his bomb syria speech outside of parliament could he have been done for incitement to violence
taking responsibility does not mean shutting up it means standing by what i say and respecting that other people may have a different point of view if i said that your comment just offended me should you delete it
yes it does look like a road map doesnt itid be quite anxious if i was stuck in a forest with a map like that
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to behave badly does that mean you actually should yes
words cannot harm and words cannot oppress words merely become excuses for poeoples lack of control or motivation
is that what you would tell your daughter darling i love you very much but intellectual brilliance is a male trait i cant say this approach of yours is very brilliant
heres a link reporting on it as if its not from a satire page httplibertyhangoutorginultimatedisplayironyleftistsburnbooksprotestfascism the funny thing is they do have a link to the original video thus they were very very close to finding out that the whole thing was a pisstake and either they missed it or they found out but reported as if its real either way bad
didnt christopher nolan make a film about that
theres something to be said for misanthropy it saves time
i voted for brexit and i have been vilified by writers for this paper and many btl commentators as a mad inward looking old stupid ignorant racist who wants to turn the clock back to  despite being educated to ma level being a member of a trade union having a professional graduate job working in one of the most deprived areas in the country having close friends of all races and religions but i accept that people will criticise mock vilify and even hate me for my views because thats what a free democracy is people have the legitimate right to call me all sorts of names because thats what politics and life is like in a country where we have civil rights what does annoy me is that the guardian appears to have double standards when it comes to who can be insulted as a white brexitvoting tory i am fair game to be insulted to the ends of the earth in this newspaper luckily for me i have  saving graces in guardianland my ovaries my longterm illness and my relatively youthful age however if i was from different groups with different opinions and political beliefs then i would be immune from all criticism and the guardian would be disgusted if anyone said anything remotely mean about me it shouldnt be that way we are all fundamentally equal given that we are all human beings and so we have to accept we are all equally deserving to both be criticised and insulted
the question is of course should free speech be absolute in my opinion it should not be no that isnt the question at all dealing in specificity is much more illuminating the old free speech isnt absolute rhetoric is just an justifying discourse for the illiberal to ban what speech they dont like
thank you for an excellent link
i did as i said it was secondhand though so he didnt see a penny i suspect he wouldnt be happy with this arrangement you were sufficiently intrigued to part with your cash absolutely correct here though how could anyone not be ive not read it but i did open at a random page and on it he describes the process of building a multistory car park in new york some kind of disaster strook the building site i think a crane collapsed and his acknowledgement that noone was hurt is dwarfed by his description of how long it set the project back a fascinating insight into his mind
another piece of research found that girls as young as six believe intellectual brilliance is a male trait it is men are more likely to be very clever and also more likely to be very stupid when you look at the distribution for women they are more likely to be in between
the main problem with pc has been the way the left has hijacked it to include their half baked ideas in an attempt to put them beyond all debate indeed shout down any debate whatsoever the eu multiculturalism islamophobia and open doors immigration should never have been considered above all debate protecting those things from it and those that refuse to condone that subjected to character assassination career destruction and even in the worse cases the laws of inciting hatred
well said
defenders of political correctness often resort to the straw man that it is nothing more than basic civility it is not it is a propaganda and social manipulation tool trying to transform the world to match the ideas of its inventorsusers by limiting or shifting what is allowed to be said in the hope that  they will gain political advantage by controlling the frame of communication external effect  they will change people by the effect that speech has on the thought processes internal effect for more see the ideas of the soviet man in revolutionary russia as well as the excellent writings of g orwell nobody has put it more succinctly than the late g carlin political correctness is fascism pretending to be manners
do you think that everyone should be held to the same standard or do you think that causing offence to some groups is ok what standard what groups why would you want to cause offence dont you have better things to do
but incite and insight are very different
good points
in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of now flip that round to the mirror image of a bevy of leftleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls and we might start to get somewhere both sides of the fence could do with some self reflection meanwhile in the middle the largely unfazed are still fighting for better pay and conditions for all they are fighting for disability rights equal pay for women which unions have won cases about because there was evidence of prejudice more secure work contracts better terms of employment racism in the workplace and beyond etc the media dont find these things as sexy and interesting as sir tim hunt making a silly joke about women though theres not enough outrage or ad revenue clicks in it
it is for the bigger names owen jones articles have recently been increasingly closed as were pollys once the corbyn mob turned on her
many many people have had it up to the eyeballs many many people would be glad to see the back of the progressive values its the precision of your argument which makes it so compelling using many twice is so much more persuasive than actual statistics and the way you fail to provide any actual examples of politically correct identity politics pseudo intellectual claptrap is the killer blow the liberal left is doomed as long as crack debaters like yourself are ranged against them
those are both problems the world is full of problems the thing is to find solutions for example how about bringing those two groups together since each meets the needs of the other

and if you do not like the opinions of the columnists you e you do not need to buy their ragsbut why do so many people read them
that person doesnt just have a right to speak that persons right to speak must be given extra protection because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with might contain a grain of historical truth might in any case give people to think about why do they know what they already think they know how do i know that i know this except that ive always been taught this and never heard anything else christopher hitchens on people with views that may be considered offensive or extreme he was specifically referring to holocaust deniers here
if you feel some speech should be censored then as far as im concerned you dont stand for free speech but where does the author condone censorship could you point out the exact e you are referring to what the author does here is in my opinion nothing as bland and easy to refute as what you are making it out to be she a points out that the widespread anger over incidents of leftist censorship on campuses is a convenient method to distract from the more troubling issue of government censorship and b correctly asserts that nobody subscribes to free speech being an absolute right which is why every society has libel laws privacy laws laws against revealing of state secrets etc and whereas most people would probably agree with drawing the line between offensive and harmful speech she refers to research demonstrating that in praxis this is actually quite a difficult distinction to make without drawing the conclusion that everybody who reinforces harmful stereotypes should be censored wouldnt it be more interesting to engage with those actual points then with the straw man of your own making ironically in your very next comment you yourself make the point that free speech does not mean free of consequences so that a legitimate reaction to stupid and harmful free speech can be to arrest somebody or even beat himher up so in what way arent you advocating censorship
i am not sure about the scale on that map for what appears to be a ramble likewise the article
yes good points also in the uk and i dont know about elsewhere the term engineer is used very widely you can be a boiler engineer mending domestic boilers or a civil engineer making sure the shard londons tallest building stays upright i think there are arguments to says this keeps people from professional engineering work because of a lack of understanding
i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening really so you dont think the fact that many people described those who voted brexit as racists really happened then and you dont think there is a climate where the words sexist and racist and any other kind of ist are thrown around with growing regularity drowning out any chance of rational debate on important issues back to the echo chamber for you abi
verbal abuse not assault
heres a thought maybe its a  stage fight  short term let them have the right to wear what they currently think they want  long term encourage them to explore the idea that what they currently want is not necessarily in their best interests yes i can see how a plan with more than one part could be incomprehensibly complex to understand ps also works with high heels plunging necklines or anything else that basically turns you unwittingly into a walking sex toy unless thats what you want to be in which case knock yourself out
you have missed the point a woman who has internalised anxiety about reading maps and feels they are not able to may be responsible for getting herself over the problem society is responsible for ensuring women in future are not damaged by the same things that have caused the individual to feel like that in the first place we are all responsible for the culture and atmosphere in which we all live together so for example if society is producing generations of young men who feel that they can only express emotion by agression it is both society and the individual who need to take action you can point to resentment built up over  years on a topic but dont make the connection that to address that our society needs to change basically the second half of your post wildly contradicts the first
absolutely well said
is steve hughes considered alt right these days posted his routine offended which takes the p out of his homophobic friend and the mod swung into action
no ones censoring anything thats a giant fucking whopper that a lot of people have fallen fortheres no law against being an arsehole but whinging when that youre being oppressed when youre actively being a twat to someone with no basis then you deserve to be told to shut up all this is is people complaining and crying on the internet when someone tells them to stop being a dick and theyre so fragile they start blogs about how people are censoring them pathetic really
censorship takes many forms including selfcensorship the threat of legal action on newspaper which circumscribes others postings as a result of the costs of litigation and simply preventing others from participating in a debate yours is a narrow and possibly selfserving definition
what on earth are you waffling on about who are the millions whove been silenced
youre free to choose any one of these two options
with afrikaans connotations
any more to your argument or is that all you have
if comment interactivity has become vital to a news outlet to continue providing a popular service to its readers then it has come to constitute a new form of internetsocial media right of reply perhaps response is better arguably following social media trends the online guardian has also transmutated into a forum for debate hence when you have an opinion piece o jones on milo he is a writercommentator and his opeds are always otherwise open the very act of preclosing comments is a political act imo it entails that the media outlet is publishing its official line on an issue which cannot be debated or even questioned this is very counterproductive to the liberal cause particularly in view of the subjects campaigning on freedom of expression and open spaces for debate
the fact that people have selfserving views which dont respond to truth but to selfinterest is not an argument against campaigning its an argument for itand objectively it has led to greater positive participation by women and minorities in public life now compared to  years ago
but you arent allow to then cry censorship when someone calls you an arsehole what about times when people have been stopped from even beginning to speak what are your thoughts on that does that count as censorship
and if you have any sense of dignity youll take responsibility for what you say not hard to understand
youre missing my point to say something is harmful is not a de facto call to ban it im not missing it one little bit youve repeated it enough times we agree on that one does not equal the other the contention i have made is that the one is designed to facilitate the other
i would say offence culturally speaking may be more like a contract both parties are complicit removing one partys freedom to offend is the same as removing anothers freedom to be offended is there value in the latter concomitant freedom also would we be better individually or societally for losing or severely curtailing it it would be interesting to see that discussed
nor is it lazy to refer to john stuart mill his view is that freedom of speech is fundamental to the workings of democracy what is truly lazy is simply to dismiss his argument without riposte perhaps we should look at this more in terms of obligations than rights there is generally an obligation on us to behave in a wellmannered and respectful way towards others which avoids giving offence unnecessarily there is also an obligation on us to speak out forcefully when we hear arguments that we believe may if they prevail do no end of harm in that case giving offence especially through humour and satire may be exactly what we should feel obliged to do for evil to prosper it is only necessary that good men do nothing
who is possibly harmed by primark pulling a tshirt though why do you feel wronged by that
my improvement would be to inhibit the inhibition of speech this wouldnt give people the right to a platform but it would prevent the denial of that platform to those who had been offered it ditto with interfering with book deals banning the sale of newspapers abuse of libel laws etc im not sure that id want to criminalise such behaviour but if we must have one law in this area id rather it was one that prohibited inhibition than one that prohibited hate speech bad ideas need to be exposed and defeated not suppressed

i thought it was an interesting article and pointed out a few things i hadnt up till now realised it appears though that a few of the brotherhood are offended although i cant see why if they think general attitudes arent reflected in language well they dont know anything about language or its uses maybe they also still think sticks and stones etc can some of the offended blokes provide an example of where language has moved the other way ie what was once pejorative is now complimentary or better or where a word applied to men has changed its meaning for the worse while its female equivalent has remained constant

please can people like michael obanreagan keep their hands off feminism and stop bringing it into disrepute i dont intend this as snark but it seems like tying to stop people bringing feminism into disrepute would be a fulltime job these days
what a ridiculous article one of the few times ive agreed with a comments section more than the article theyre addressing embarrassing to think this writer got paid for this trumped up tripe
first mr shariatmadari states that there is a consensus of most linguists without providing any clue as to where this consensus can be seen the routledge language and cultural theory reader pp  would be a good place to start thoroughly documented which would suggest that dss article is understating matters rather than cherrypicking care to provide a counterexample
this paragraph shows the weakness of the argument if one looks hard enough firstly you will find the male equivalents in odd uses second he cherry picked the derogatory terms there are plenty of examples of similar terms used for men third he says that at one time they were simply equivalents back then in the deeply sexist past  ds was writing a guardian article not publishing a peerreviewed research paper he probably understates the degree to which pejoration applies much more to terms related to women than it does to terms related to men see the routledge language and cultural theory reader pp  for the issue documented at length
this is one of the most ridiculous articles the guardian has ever published and thats going up against some stiff competition whats sad is you probably think this is boldly telling uncomfortable truth to power structures or something
family life and thats a big one
just to say that i too thoroughly enjoyed your article a welcome relief after all the inadequately researched pieces not simply in the guardian that accompanied the original brouhaha over the odo entry on rabid though the comments on your own piece not the article itself frequently confuse the oed with the odo so it all quickly turns into a miasma of confusion the odo entry on rabid incidentally started life in  in the printed first edition of the oxford dictionary of english it seems to have been incorporated without change into the oxford dictionary online and three further examples added the melding of the original physical text and the online version isnt seamless as rabid feminist is referred to as a sentence when its actually a phrase the odo is better than the ode much more material but i still wouldnt pay money for the premium version cant see how a few examples beyond the basic three are worth it when theres google itself to use to check for current usage a final point its useful to use the google ngram in conjunction with odo to get a crude sense of the frequency of the occurrence of terms if you do this you discover that radical feminist is more frequent by a factor of four than the phrase rabid feminist which may be why odo has a specific entry on radical feminist but not as yet one on rabid feminist
it appears to me that this article is pointing out seemingly innocuous ways that sexism is perpetuated in society it has been my experience that sexism is so commonplace that it is almost invisible when someone dares to point out its existence and question the day to day suppression of women they are attacked with scorn we do tend to as a society vilify those who challenge our way of thinking we lump them into a group and hurl nasty comments at them if we could only stop think ask questions try to see anothers viewpoint and perhaps come to an agreement that is mutually beneficialhow much better off we would all be
another load of rubbish from the poisonous regressive left i hope real lefties will wake up soon amp take the fight to these pc idiots that are weakening left wing politics amp destroying our societies
the weavers woman world and todays one conditioned by a th century environment and todays created beliefs of feminists the point of the article is the writers view in the article that women are weak or vulnerable nope a sexist untruth women who are strong and men who are weak exist in large numbers inside and outside sexist barriers separating people into victim and villain by skin colour its intent the individuals responsibility irrelevant nope both have a justified bad reputation equality nope one gender alone is the focus of the writer yet war or toiling on the fields high suicide rates or disconnection from family life are disadvantages handed to the other gender the writers point is not about equality social conditioning is the point and a writer who personally thinks genders are very important thats all i disagree genders arent important nothing good or bad about them prefer to deal with people
thinking about the male equivalents of some of these words throws their sexism into sharp relief master for mistress sir for madam governor for governess bachelor for spinster courtier for courtesan whereas the male list speaks of power and high status the female list has a very different set of connotations these are of either subordinate status or sexual service to men the crucial thing to remember is that at one time they were simply equivalents this paragraph shows the weakness of the argument if one looks hard enough firstly you will find the male equivalents in odd uses second he cherry picked the derogatory terms there are plenty of examples of similar terms used for men third he says that at one time they were simply equivalents back then in the deeply sexist past this kind of attack on language especially english which is a constantly evolving language in order to promote any kind of agenda is as rabidly fascist as it gets i resent the idea deeply as i see english usage as a wonderful organic process that should not be tampered with individuals can choose how they use it i for one never use the words above they are dated and irrelevant except when roleplaying with my gf
youd figure people would do better than cherrypicking eight terms to force a false scope and then expect a good reaction perhaps not perhaps were so caught up in sensationalism that all logic goes out the window as is even the  some seemed forced to fit rabid you are more likely to think of a dog than anyone or anything human mistress has  meanings  of them empowering arguably hussy is used more by women than men madam again a word with multiple connotations whittled down to one ps for men it would be pimp should it be pimpess i see no problem with governess courtesan clearly you havent watched firefly dont even know anyone who uses wench outside of period pieces same with tart in the end the argument in and of itself and ergo the posting seem laughable almost a mockery this is basically faux rage over nothing
of course i read it and ive reread it why wouldnt i read it
alright well firstly have you ever heard of a breast pump secondly oxytocin is not a mother thing its a people thing oxytocin levels increase in parents of any gender when they play with and care for their children there tends to be higher levels in mothers because they are more often the primary caregivers you have your causation the wrong way round thirdly what possibly reason could you have for thinking that it is a mans duty to outearn his partner and provide for her financially why why is it bad for a woman to be able to financially support her family why is a man dishonorable if he earns less than his partner whereas a woman is allowed to earn less than her partner why is there a double standard your masculinity sounds pretty fragile to be honest if its based on outearning a woman some guys want to be full time dads and thats fine you make it sound like hes failed to have a wellpaying career rather than choosing to do a different kind of job parenting weirdly enough we dont have to act exactly like all other mammals just because we belong to that group were capable of making our own decisions based on preferences and personal circumstances children brought up by fulltime dads are not damaged its our attitudes towards dads that need repair
perhaps you have never had a face to face disagreement with a radical feminist they can froth at the mouth spray spittle and have been known to bite best to keep a bucket of cold water or a garden hose handy hey i was married to one for  years we got along in our own way she died a few years ago i wish she was here to bite me for this comment
nice e and well done in bringing it forward the author is not seeking to prove that pejoration happens more frequently to words that refer to women than those that refer to men it is enough apparently to state that others most linguists believe it it is a variant of he said she said and the fox news classic some people say we should be thankful that he avoided using some people might think which i have definitely seen btl here at the guardian only a matter of time before that phrase makes it atl
sleaze and sleazey are words that have a consistent gender connotation
en masse not on mass for somebody reading linguistics nerds a little odd you wouldnt know that
i cant imagine a man saying rakes make the best husbands this would have to be an opinion expressed by women a sexiest comment no i didnt misspell
the problem is that many modern third wave feminists cherry pick the comments from the past that they want to accept and ignore the rest that are more extreme inclusive radical and dangerous here we see tom actively engaging in cherrypicking while complaining about cherrypicking priceless
how about the term lecher or one that i have always thought comical in its negativity womanizer at  years of age the one that i have lately grown fond of is dirty old man
oh do kindly wander off lmfao or here try this when i see a rational argument ill respond in same when i dont ill respond in same your argument horrible everyone must stop using english from now on after all we dont want to be misogynists do we this is the only solution and well have to apologize for using the language for so long god forbid we find some words that demean men as well then well have to start apologizing all over again included a giant strawman a woe is me defence two deflections and both completely missed the point of the article and overreacted like a hyperventilating teen so here make some rational arguments like adults do and ill give you the adult response until then as i said do kindly wander off p
come on you didnt correct my spelling your spell check did and in my defence id just like to say i plagiarised from throwthismobout who misspelt it first p
forebearance forebearance defined as patient self control restraint and tolerance you are having a laugh arent you you mean women are meant to be grateful for equal rights and universal suffrage and if we tried any if that larko in a repressive and unequal society wed know all about it i sincerely hope this forum is the biggest platform you have to promulgate such patriarchal old toot
i guess you dont hail from the bogside then
i heard women were getting sexually assaulted on mass in europe
are you trying to say the same behaviour in girls is called bossy and in boys is called bullying or what
you said this is kinda like how loads of guardian articles and their like suggest that people use the phrase boys will be boys to excuse rapists which i have never ever seen please provide links to articles that say this
i must move in unusual circles
how many feminists do you think that covers connie st louis original tweet was retweeted  times so what thats nothing in the hysterical outrage sphere that is twitterworld where people sit waiting to be jerked into life by some morons thoughts or reporting does retweeting consitute being an accessory to the fact of unwittingly destroying a mans career here are some better questions why did the media treat this as a story splashing his name all over the place why did radio  pester him for a comment as soon as he landed why did ucl not follow proper procedure and more or less force him to resign from his honorary position why did they not reinstate him if this woman was a liar how could connie st louis have predicted the shitstorm that was about to be unleashed and please if youre going to link to the daily mail put a warning on it that is the most odious piece of shit in journalism tim hunt was extremely misguided and out of touch if he thought that posing as a male chauvinist pig was going to go down well when it was translated americans dont get the british sense of humour so no wonder it went down like a lead balloon in korea and many other countries i do feel sorry for the guy but the end of feminism this is not this story is similar in that one man michael obanreagan got offended over the oed and tweeted about it pathetic thankfully no people were harmed this time but again we see feminism being kicked and youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem
lol i meant that even orwell couldnt have envisaged the extent to which the masses themselves appear intent on straitjacketing the language
you may want to check out another post i just recently put up about the book the alphabet vs the goddess i dont but thats probably because i have a wie
please see my response which i decided to post as a standalone comment httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejaneightwordssexismheartenglishlanguagecomment
yes it does thinking about the male equivalents of some of these words throws their sexism into sharp relief master for mistress sir for madam governor for governess bachelor for spinster courtier for courtesan whereas the male list speaks of power and high status the female list has a very different set of connotations these are of either subordinate status or sexual service to men the crucial thing to remember is that at one time they were simply equivalents
how many feminists were displeased so far ive only come across evidence that one man michael obanreagan was so moved as to tweet oxford dictionaries other than that if hes managed to whip up some twitter hysteria among the easily led well more fool them regarding the e from ann oakleys book no  in a chronological list of  examples i have the book here its called taking it like a woman obviously in reference to the common phrase taking it like a man ann oakley is quite aware of how language embodies ideas about men and women having read the pages before and after the e which dont really throw any light on the subject i dont think the phrase is meant in a negative way despite noting it as an example from  oxford dictionaries have mised the title of the book as taking it like woman and put  as if it were published in  sloppy apart from that i cant see anything wrong with using the e as an example of historic usage how long had the entry been there no feminists had ever complained about its use before please can people like michael obanreagan keep their hands off feminism and stop bringing it into disrepute its interesting to note that ann oakley attributes a certain amount of her feminism to her not having any brothers and attending a girls school not the kind of experience obanreagan is likely to have from the blurb on the back in her autobiography she describes the events which made her a feminist and the kind of mother wife academic and writer she is this book is about my life but it is also about others she writes every woman will find some reflection of her own personality and feelings this is feminism forged from a lived experience as a woman and as the title hints having to write yourself into the language michael obanreagan can take his faux outrage and shove it and by the way reading some of the nonsense posted in the comments id rather be a rabid feminist than a rabid antifeminist any day
none of the words listed above are used anymore they are remnants of language used long ago
i did maybe you didnt or perhaps you simply agreed with the inferences i dont
nope victorian feminists were routinely called the shrieking sisterhood connoting shrillness as well as inappropriate volumewhat interests me is the conversion of shrill the adjective into a noun oed example or a verb
new to the english language remember the monty python skit of the hungarianenglish dictionaryhttpsyoutubevaqjhhfio
of course language can be controlled at least to some extent and it always has been efforts range from officially appointed language police such as the academie francaise to usage guides dictionaries teachers parents and what the members of any group deem acceptable to say these standards evolve words my grandfather used to talk politely about nonwhite people and women he disapproved of are now very far from acceptable the vigor of the current discussion encourages me to think that this evolution is continuing in a positive direction
i suppose the oed must reflect the actual usage especially if it is established consider this you are knew to the english language and are speaking to native english speakers using a politically correct version of all the definitions in this list first of all you are likely to insult your listeners secondly you will misinterpret their communications when these words are used so the bottom line is that you will not understand or be understood and surely that is the purpose of the oed to make oneself able to understand and be understood they have no other choice and to insist on something else is social suicide
the word whore seeks to punish womens sexuality whether they are literally a prostitute or they they are deemed to have sex with too many men ie any time they dont have exclusive sex with a man they are married to no one genuinely thinks of a man as a whore even if he is a prostitute
the point is that there a a process observable in the case of a number of words still in use in which terms originally applied to both men and women are first limited to women only and then acquire pejorative andor strictly sexual meaningsis be very interested to hear of any cases of the same process in words still used exclusively about men can you suggest any
just did google ngram caseinsensitive search on rabid communist and rabid feministrabid feminist peaks in  at  of all words in english books rabid communist peaked in  at nearly three times that frequency at 
yes true its not the dictionary itself that is the problem its the mindsets that the dictionary comes from
maybe read the article first
youre the one talking about a ban the article doesnt and nobody is advocating controlling language the thousands of comments on  article merely show that lots of people want to give their views on usage if you have not heard any of the words discussed your experience differs markedly from that off lots of women commenting here
youd think that given how much of a fuss they make over societys expectations of men they wouldnt want to add to the pressures of men by labeling anybody who doesnt conform to their masculine ideals as a mangina i think they use the term mangina precisely because of those expectations and pressures like a kind of social counterweight its sort of like theyre saying these men eg male feminists are making life hard for men as a whole so lets try and shame them into a conformist idea of manhood that makes things more comfortable for us doesnt work of course since most people think mras and red pillers are a joke and much of what passes for thought among these people consists of vaguely conspiratorial nonsense the red pill metaphor itself is a prime example but based on their ideological approach they have to have some way of spreading their ideas and enforcing group cohesion you dont want to be a mangina do youonce they get more men into their fold
except it was a common saying that rakes makes the best husbands not very negative
i think it is you who has missed the point and you have done so entirely who is talking of banning words certainly not this article youve gone off on a complete tangent the article is not really about words what its about is social attitudes to women over the ages it makes the point that if you study the way the meanings of words used to describe women has changed over time then it gives a clear insight into the social attitudes towards women that caused these changes the examples given are very clear how people choose to respond to people who hold negative attitudes about them doesnt come into the article at all so i have no idea why you are chatting about this but it is of relevance that the article contrasts the fate of the feminine version of certain words with the connotations attached to the masculine version and finds that the latter still give status even while the former now take it away you can tell women to brush it off all you like but its undeniable that women face negativity and put downs far more than men do
another whose name may well become synonymous in the future with being intellectually challenged adjusting positive terms to have negative connotations is rife through all the languages of the world sometimes the letters of a word are anagramatically changed and sometimes they are simply reversed to give the opposite meaning to the original thought is that also potential examples of sexism driven manipulation or is it simply because we have a limited range of sounds available to us and using a reversal or reconstruing of those sounds to give a related or opposite meaning makes logical sense should women no longer be allowed to menstruate because it can possibly be construed to be a term implying that women should be subjugated to men should men object because the addition of the letters wo prior to rather than after men implies that males are somehow inferior to females should the word women be changed to woperdiminutivehuwoperdiminutivehuow a never ending construct to avoid all signs of sexism and ageismthe mind boggles to mimic your own leaps of faith why english alone in your article does this mean that you think english speaking men are all misogynists and english speaking women are all abettors in denial of their own sexuality are you by implication a bigot implicitly claiming that you are somehow better than the rest of the english speakers you know because you think the language of your forefathers hows that for another potentially sexist phrase was absent the same type of sexually based terminology it wasnt and isnt are you so inwardly ashamed of your own sexuality that you insist on taking sides where no sides are there to be taken is that what its really all about do you think the world should all be about you amazing how far it is possible to take things once we get on an out of contextual roll isnt it ever heard the phrase  men are all dogsor far worse most men have and we dont find it particularly worrysome in case you hadnt noticed sexism and the evolution of terminology to fit same does go both ways
the grooming gangs of rotherham rochdale and other places appear to take a different view as do the muslim fathers imposing the hijab on their daughters and muslim husbands requiring their wives to walk four aces behind them and the imams holding the testimony of women as being half the value of that of a man
as the article explicitly acknowledges
secondly that doesnt answer the question this article in particular clearly doesnt call for any word to be banned you can be such a tart wench he is speaking of the words as a negative there really is no reason you can not bring them back to their original meaning madam
they obviously used that one as well there were  sample phrases given
like many commenters you dont seem to have noticed that the article focuses on words where the female form has become derogatory over time while the male one hasnt nor that it is an article about english that implies nothing whatsoever about the comparison of english with other languages
no that would be a wilful misinterpretation of the logic of the article
hes not did you actually read the article
no it doesnt the article acknowledges at least one of the other definitions of madam and doesnt in any way claim that all uses of madam imply prostitution
it should probably be noted here that women can indeed speak their mind and justifiably so but revionist thinking is only made possible by the forebearance of those same men they attack as an example of this women might try to stage demonstrations regarding how they are perceived and treated in say saudi arabia or iran to understand and appreciate the platform and freedom they have been provided in more enlightened countries no western society is not yet free of sexism and may not ever be completely but it is light years ahead of most other countries in that respect
well okay whats interesting depends on your mentality of course i found it interesting that this phrase which has become the target of some feminists displeasure was being used by a feminist tbh its hard to go much further with this without having read the book in question which i havent because ones obliged to speculate about everything which is fine facetoface but a bit laborious in a post so just this my two guesses are i she was using it in a way that alluded to the way other people specific or not might use it and to the attitudes of such people or perhaps less likely ii she was using it unironically or mockteenagerly given that she was writing about teachers school context as a kid might have said im a rabid cliff richard fan the very uncertainty that a few minutes reflection leads to is interesting to me right not you i got that and is part of the richness of the oed and its whole system of using such little snippets part of whats good about it among the curious they arouse curiosity i wonder what thats all about and so on some people are curious some are just looking for trouble seek and ye shall find
andoh you thought i was suggesting something about women nope not at all some of us have a nerve thats sensitive to people who see things in very restricted terms withagainst etc and try to inflict the impulses this produces in them on everyone else try to force us to pit on the same blinkers they walk around in thats the one i was on about
dear zebra really appreciate you taking the time to leave a nice comment its very encouraging thanks
i am always very attentive when it comes to impose people how they have to think and how they are suppose to speak reminds me totalitarian historical moments 
the ones they agree with
who many btl comments did that get
maybe daesh think the same as me or die
except it is not either or and misses the way in which language evolves master as a form of personal address is today applied to young boys it is far more common to used as an expression of control or achievement thus a woman can master a task as well as a man im not sure what bachelor or spinster even makes the list given to decline in marriage rates and outside of cupasoup acronyms in university degrees and the opening of jane austen novels i cant recall the last time i heard it used in conversation likewise spinster i tell a lie i recently heard it in a poem about a spider the courtiercourtesan thing is simply desperation which leaves me wondering why the obvious slut was not used but then what the article doesnt address is why bother
sounds like hes suggesting manipulating language in order to manipulate thought where have i heard that before
perhaps not but youre chosen examples fail to appreciate the way in social history aspects of english that words are attached to prostitutes does not necessarily mean that they are a denigration one needs to consider how and why they were attached and also to consider the status of prostitution and that the original meaning still remains madam being the most obvious example i doubt anyone in a shop or restaurant or on a letter is using the term to suggest that the person is running a house of ill repute also it is odd to cite husewif given the political rows there have been with regard to the modern usage housewife indeed i recall a rather ardent feminist friend claiming that to be a housewife was to be prostitute with a single client
my problem with inherent sexism is that it is too similar to original sin it is a line of reasoning that convicts people of wrongs that they are not aware of and had not intended and would not have had any control over as a young catholic being told i was a sinner when i was born because i caused my mother pain this is quite the same i have no ill will towards women i do not think they are inferior to men or that there are jobs more suited for but if i use certain words i am a sexist or even just by being born with a penis i am sexist in some peoples view there is of course inherent sexism in a golf course that only allows male memberships or a number of other such explicitly sexist circumstances but when we start picking apart language which is not a thing that can be controlled we end up alienating people more than bringing them into the light
i do not think it is necessarily a racist term it comes from a latin root for black and thus has a similarity to the infamous n word however it could just as easily allude to mudslinging or putting dirt on someone or to blacken with soot as if one was held over a fire as it specifically refers to a persons reputation of course reputation could include racial background but it also means many many other things besides id like to see some more in depth etymology that cites first uses and so on
why study anything
in the kind of polite society i grew up in both of those are very negative connotations ladies man would be a nice way of saying it rake has always been a negative description watch any noir film and even up until the s it was used that way
soldier in the th century was a positive term now it means a shameful person who deserves to be decapitated by machete or prosecuted by lawyers
the offered examples are not great bastard for instance is often used as a term of affection and there is unlikely to be a direct female of equivalent of cuckold since the word derives from cuckoo in the nest and has a secondary meaning relating to sexually aggressive hen
these were my exact thoughts qkelly tom guy why dont you cherry pick us a e im sure you can find a super extreme one that we can all extrapolate to represent the whole movement
words change over time remember when net had no association with computers all language changes pronunciation and meaning due to shifts in culture attitudes and influences there are negative connotations of some words this is because people have negative emotions and want to express them to seek to erase such uses is to deny that people have emotions there are newer ones like ratchet that youve left out i dont say ratchet bitches im not gutter like that but people do should we ban the word ratchet even when it refers to tools i take issue with this whole concept that we can fight sexism by controlling the language what oup did was wrong and the excuse was salt in the wound i mean really rabid dog but this article is reaching a bit far who even says wench outside of a pirate movie or tart for that matter if you say tart in my house there had better be something desertlike involved
it certainly is ironic that the numerous aggressive and dismissive comments that appear under these kinds of articles sort of drive the point home
i also love how the people who pull the but what about misogyny in islam card literally only start caring about the oppression of women in islamic societies when the conversation is about women in their own society thats the only time theyll mention it as a distraction tactic its gross theyre basically using the oppression of one set of women as a stick with which to beat the issues faced by other women
just as we cast off old worn garments tired patriarchal word will become archaic replaced by new definitive adventures for example the word virago has some tired misogynist meanings but it is a great word from vir and what i aspire to be
words change in meaning all the time its what they do there are books and studies about this phenomenon this article cherry picks words to make a point that seems meaningless one could do exactly the same thing to highlight words that are derogatory to men dogs muffins or pretty much anything elsei also find it intriguing that someone as concerned about the purported embedded sexism of english dictionaries and society has a last name that includes the word sharia second only to jihad in negative connotations as regards the mysogynous perception and treatment of women perhaps in a show of solidarity for women he could change it to pantywaist or perhaps milquetoast both dictionary terms for subservient and weak men
by this logic bitch just refers to dogs and is in no way sexist stop this doublethink
ok so this article has pointed it out now what
but youre only looking at one category of words if you look at words and phrases like x is a shit wanker full of shit wankstain bag of piss old fart they tend to be applied to men exclusively i cant think off the top of my head of female equivalents an interesting selection of scatological references which kind of prove a point that men will be insulted by comparison to bodily waste products ie faeces urine and semen in the absence of bilateral sexual activity words to denigrate women are more likely to refer to sexual proclivity almost as if men were afraid of female sexuality and wanted to keep women in line through their choice of insult
a proper little madam according to the article this rather common phrase chide a child implies prostitution rather than grand behaviour
sadly this comment rings so true as you say the vitriol leads to a vicious cycle in which many people are disuaded from joining in with the discussion the discussion becomes an even worse bigoted and antifeminist echochamber full of even more vitriol and so on then everybody ends up assuming that the views represented in these comments are the views held by the majority of the readers which isnt true im always glad to see when people choose to brave it down here though thanks for your comment 
this is a silly analysis any of us can add  or more examples of words that denigrate women but we can do the same for men and why focus on english this is true of all languages ever spoken if we go to the oxford dictionary online we will see there are over  words in it and that every year s of new words are entered and fall out of use even a  words denigrating woman is a tiny percentage of the whole and often there are doubles with similar meanings liberty freedom accompanied with slang sometimes even more a reflection of the history of english
well now thats just the pot calling the kettle black isnt it
also note that words for sexually active men carry no such negative connotations rake and philanderer come to mind so the sexism goes both ways
yep fabulously demonstrating why people dont feel good about leaving positive comments on feminist pieces right there they cant even say thanks i liked this article and i appreciate you publishing it without being taken to task why do they owe anybody a justification for thinking its a good piece its a comment not an essay why do you care why they liked it tell me do you plan on trawling through all the comments calling this article rubbish and ask them to provide reasons for their whinging or do you only have a problem with the fawning people who liked it
what this article misses is how the abbott led government speaks in opposites if they says ey will do this they will then end up doing that best friend of medicare means they will do everything they can to destroy it im a bit of an environmentalist means he believes in digging big holes in the ground and polluting the atmosphere public servants have nothing to fear yet hes sacked around  since he became pm you can look at anything he says and then look at what he did it is opposites a word game usually played with children in rd grade
good article thanks quite amusing until i remember my country is run by these dunderheads but i do worry about it the abbott governments language trickery is really astonishing for the purpose of demonizing those struggling at the lower end to justify brutal budget solutions there was the attempt to divide the country into lifters and leaners some comments above mention stopping boats and the casting of asylum seekers as illegal immigrants morrison as minister for immigration maintained a near media blackout on what was happening to people trying to reach our shores and in the detention centres they are spirited away to shutting nearly every question down by refusing to comment on operational matters but what are operational matters the new defense minister when unable to name the head of isis something that is a matter of public record said he would not discuss operational matters what very telling why couldnt he just say he didnt know like a a normal human being honestly ive stopped listening to them all they do is spruik and obfuscate cant we have some new better intelligent more fully human ones
you also often see that when people talk about we and our when discussing australia it is a narrowly conceived and populated australia and an exclusive and excluding we and our although it purports to speak for everyone covering over contradictory voices and discourses
weve hit the trifecta with abbott his words are infantile and divisive his actions are destructive and hurtful his heart is black and evil what more could the current average australian want
do you mean lives or shores
generally i agree with the thrust of the argument but the article is a more than a bit thin you missed wonderful abbott opportunities with death cult and blood oath two other things shirtfronting is an afl term not a rugby word and the ricky muir tv interview preceded his maiden speech by almost a year not the week beforeb
abbotts tactic seems to be to apply some eloquence as a get out of jail chastening after the spill motion and scatalogical after the julia menu event being two examples
its a new south welshmans way of ingratiating himself with the vics if he was rugbying it he may have said shoulder charge both i believe are now illegal
repetitive slogans stereotype the current political discourse the most notable feature is that discourse has changed from inclusive language to exclusive language inclusive and exclusive language is when somebody includes or excludes somebody else through the words that they use it is when you say positive things to someone so that they feel valued and accepted whether in a group or society however exclusive language is the complete opposite it involves somebody speaking words that exclude someone and makes them feel rejected not valued and outcast from a group or society team australia is an example using exclusive language can discriminate against people and make them feel inferior especially if they are different because of their race religion gender education or if they have a disability the problem is that the current coalition has proceeded through their language use to exclude just about everybody
for asylum not from
abbott and conservatives will often use language that is seemingly progressive and benign to cover over opposite points of view that are much less progressive and would be far too offensive if said plainly for example the oft expressed seemingly humanitarian concern about saving lies at sea as the raison detre for the boats policy not appeasing the racism and bigotry of reclaim types abbott has gone on record now as saying that stopping the boats is more important than preventing drownings even boats is linguistic trickery what is being stopped is humans making claims from asylum calling them boats covers over what is really intended then abbott proclaims himself a feminist environmentalist etc etc duttons statement to asylum seekers about the wealth of opportinities in cambodia is another example of seemingly benign even attractive language deliberately covering over a darker reality they are all adept at newspeak and dangerous inveterate liars
probably why abbott was so confused about it he obviously thought it meant deferring to your guest
i find it astounding that we have a prime minister who is such an awful public speaker how did it happen he has to repeat himself err repeatedly as if he thinks we are all as stupid as he is three word slogans repetition its pretty uninspiring i find i switch off when he appears on my tv screen hes worse than silly billy mcmahon was
actions speak loader than words this man is a very poor prime minister and the sooner he departs from our lives the better of we as a nation will be 
i think shirtfront might be an australian rules football term not rugby maybe check that excellent macquarie dictionary of yours
the kneejerk resorting to australianisms like fair dinkum this from a migrant who only arrived here at ten years of age to shore up his nationalistic kudos is a reminder of rudds cringeworthy fair suck of the saucebottle an embarrassing obvious signal to the intellectuallystunted all it does is demonstrate that the speaker is a vulgar little blowhard
for someone of such obvious limited intellect abbott does no do too badly in terms of language he manages to get the word collegial into at least every second sentence and apart from long passages of silence and head nodding generally avoids comparisons with zippy the pinhead
to shirtfront is a term from australian football not rugby
middle class people have lost their minds
exactly my experience too
so youre not too keen on freedom of speech then ok fair enough what did i specifically say that you managed to misinterpret as objecting to free speech
agreed
but when university students say they dont want to listen and noplatform someone or walk out of a debate because they find a persons views offensive they are told they are snowflakes shutting down debate its pc gone mad etc if the left responds in kind the other alternative then we just become a society tearing ourselves apart by hurling insults at one another and failing to actually communicate at all and all reasonable debate is lost
not completely its been an endlessly useful paper tiger for knowingly careless ideologues
thats the thing about yiannopoulos and his ilk they like to cry free speech whenever theyre challenged but they have free speech what they demand is that people politely listen to them without recourse
please remember a large part of airing ones political views in a forum like the guardian is a languid exercise in virtue signallingespecially if we are white we must fall over backwards to be critical of other white people male overprivileged types whilst showing how much more progressive and liberal we are in comparisonas feminists we must insist that women and men be treated the same even though the  genders are demonstrably different its not enough to treat people fairlylastly no absolutely no jokes are allowed that target anyone except ourselves well those overprivileged old white guys anywayhumour after all could be applied as a microaggressionman to be alive in an era where hate speech micro aggression and safe space are considered legitimate concepts is a real bummer
i dont read the daily fail very often but one thing i did notice is the fact that whenever katie hopkins posts all comments are monitored in other words if you dont agree with the stupid woman your post wont get published
im not a fan of hate speechvery few arebut i know one thing that terrifies more people and thats when they are not allowed to say it in the first place i strongly believe in free speechim an artist and no one can tell me what i can or cannot draw or sculptand its the same with words if i am correctthe laws says you cannot say  go and shoot that man over theresomething that incites actual violenceand that seems fair and reasonable to meand should not be allowedbut to say  i hate and think they are stupidit would be better if were not around that on the other handi feel is fineis self expression and should be protected yesit hurtslife is sufferinganswer backor walk awaypreventing anything horrible from being said will encourage idiots to trumps sideno one wants that
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed the white part is no coincidence because political correctness is a western construct the west being mainly white that aside this comment manages to brush over some of the most important nonwhitenonstraightnonmale commentators who express wholly partly antipc views and are often hated even more by selfproclaimed progressives for having in their eyes defected whatever your views on these people some of the language used against them from the supposedly pc side of the argument porch monkey etc has been just as disgusting as the sort of bile katie hopkins writes but is never funnily enough mentioned in the same vein these commentators face a far more tangible threat of physical harm than almost anybody and many are routinely characterassassinated in this paper and other organs like it to whatever extend i agreedisagree with them they actually represent a wide variety of positions i admire their courage that last part applies equally to the white male straight classprivileged i like to judge people on their ideas and actions rather than this sort of thing milo yiannopoulos gaylarry elder blackchristina hoff sommers female feministmaajid nawaz moderate muslimayaan hirsi ali female somali exmuslimgad saad arabic lebanese jew whose family fled lebanon for canada when he was a childmorgan freeman blackdouglas murray gay
if you view yourself as being in some kind of battle with katie hopkins class privileged white males and the far right as your sole adversaries you seriously misreading the world around you the range of dissent is far far wider than this nice people who stand to lose a lot through being labelled nasty leave the genuine horrors to battle it out with you in public an abandonment of rough and ready egalitarianism for an attenuated hierarchy of identities based on perceived privilige was always going to go wrong fairly quickly even if it started with the best of intentions the minute you give a group of people an unquestionable power over others i feel i am a victim therefore i am one it begins to corrupt and they begin to try to batten down any dissent that threatens that power in pc culture historical victimhood legitimises current power and its peculiar nature is this intertwining of a narrative of passive helplessness with an absolute aggression those referred to as snowflakes are often not actually fragile but are just very adept at using this narrative of victimhood to aggressively bully others either directly or indirectly by coopting the more passive or unaware towards this aim the effects of this are actually harmful and far reaching as progressivism as a political culture is dragging us all into moral incoherence with no alternative in sight as the nice persons default world view amnesty international have recently spoken out for example on what they see as a growing intolerance fostered by the far right by this they mean the white far right what they think of the far right that is not white the one that is pushing the current exodus out of afghanistan for instance is quite troubling we need a new paradigm and quickly
free to offend to offend is a doing verb to be offensive is not free in civilised behaviour where rights are equal before the lawoffensive behaviour that is not prejudice but inconsiderate is no longer acceptable will end with a penalty a example of congestion levy as well as parking restrictions is penalise when ignorant of the restrictionsfailure to be considerate is liable penalty within the law makes freedom a price to pay when restrictions comes with an imposed penalty
no it doesnt really spoil my pithy comeback but thank you for the compliment ive not seen any evidence of widespread rioting and violence perpetrated by left wing activists a couple of incidents does not a revolutionary society make
you just proved his point bigot
there is an obvious need to distinguish between that which is unlawful in other words a criminal offence and that which society at large disapproves offree speech the legal right of an individual to express themselves as they want is curtailed in the uk by a no of offences threatening abusive or insulting words constitute an offence and there are others relating to hate speech glorifying terrorism and the like the law tends to give a significant margin of appreciation to such matters taking into account the importance of the principle of freedom of expressionfree speech permits and legitimises protest against state power it helps to prevent the oppression of minority viewpoints it allows for the exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives it encourages individual critical thinking it helps to prevent blinkered thinking taking hold it allows the truth to emerge from the competition of the marketplace it is an essential ingredient of a western democracy it is therefore of real importance and must be valuedhowever i do accept that the importance of ensuring that free speech is legal does not mean it needs to go unchallenged by those who hold an opposing viewpoint we are governed by complex social conventions about what is acceptable both in terms of language and opinionswhat we must wrestle with is how to highlight or criticise speech that breaches our societal construct of what is acceptable as pc seeks to do without fundamentally undermining the vital human right of freedom of expression for my part noplatforming and the like tend to go too far
that might be cos its coming from you
i live in hope that one day ill meet someone who actually objects to pc on wellfounded intellectual grounds to date every objection to pc ive heard boils down to the speaker losing hisher shit because they cant be as unpleasant to others as theyd really like to be
well satirized by john cleese peoples front of judea vs the cast were quite familiar with student politics a friend who was active in his clp has seen the militants take over and basically shut downexclude anyone who is not them denying people the right to address their own clp is no platforming too is it not where else should they meet as clp members
first they can for the porn
were all fucking idiots now and againits part of being human
this controversy largely exists because of the ease it is to drum up outrage by right wing commentators about a few nutty eccentrics at universities being a grave threat to freedom it is a fake issue
men are more likely to be very clever and also more likely to be very stupid when you look at the distribution for women they are more likely to be in between even if your argument were not utter bollocks it still does not preclude women being brilliant i figured this out and im not even a man
political correctness is a disease and needed an antidote because it was stifling free speech that however is no excuse for delighting in wanton offence
ive spoken to a few quite high profile opinion columnists about this in recent months and they all say the same thing the quality of the debate is so poor btl that they all gave up even looking at the comments a long time ago and i cant say i blame them why wade through torrents of shit just to engage with a few nuggets of sweetcorn
he isnt a conservative
when talking you do not try to restrict what the other side is allowed to say you do not have control over the definition of terms etc in genuine and civilized political discourse there is no intimidation of shaming tactics involved i can go on and on but as i suggested to another poster here you may want to read a bit on political communications history of propaganda etc you will find a striking resemblance of pc with methods used by the totalitarian regimes of th century
are you vogon by any chance oh sorry was that a little bit imaginaryspeciesist
people should be free to express their opinions on any subject they wish short of calling for violence against others or shouting fire in a crowded theater they should also be free to express their opinions in any manner they may choose but they should not be protected by the government from the consequences of their speech except in the case of physical harm
i have no issue with hate speech laws in principal but i do have concerns about who decides where the line is drawn since context is just as important if not more important that the content of what is said
but a lot of what people want shut down isnt abusive language its opposing views that they want banned for being offensive rather than debating the issue
you see there are nuances take the white supremacist fuckwit who was punched in the face the other day i have to admit that i watched that video in delight over and over again on youtube that day there was something beautiful psychedelic about it part of me the politically correct one was saying that the guy who punched him should go to jail however the other part was hoping that he didnt get caught but you dont want me to be politically correct do you do you
people will criticise mock vilify and even hate me for my views  views are fair game for mockery criticism etc personal identities are not precisely because only the former can be changed thats not a double standard
i love me some banter and particularly on a tangled and troublesome topic that said ill have to lay out why we cant have any banter at this stage what worries the likes of myself comes down to a the influential position of certain key speakers what influential position of which key speakers and b the lack of criticism afforded to their output from within the broader leftwing spherecommentary again what output from whom i cant respond to something when im not at all clear as to who or what youre talking about the guardian can reliably publish an editorial which completely encompasses a headinthesand approach to theocracy all this does is give the right wing groups more reason to mistrust the presentday left and imagine themselves as the only ones who have any interest in maintaining aspects of western society theres an interesting point and i agree with you i make much the same point on immigration in america when liberals refuse to have a serious discussion it gives fuel to the hysterically xenophobic fires of some conservative circles the only issue id take here is that youre defining the g as a leftwing publication and therefore implying that the stance that it or some similar publication offers can be taken as the position of the modern left as a modern leftist i can assure you that i dont take the editorial stance of the g as gospel if people would stop incorrectly labelling the g as a leftist paper or labelling centrist liberals as lefties there wouldnt be so much confusion as to what the left is about and we wouldnt be asked to defend the positions of mindless liberals we have nothing to do with which is part of the point i was making in my first reply leftwing theocratic apologism under the guise of political correctness is unsustainable again what leftwing theocratic apologism the notion that we dont have any business overthrowing foreign governments i hold that position and i can defend it but that isnt theocratic apologism its just obeying international law or are you referring to the liberal position on freedom of religion that allows moslem women to wear a veil at some point if you really want to have some discussion and see some other points of view youll have to move beyond debating meaninglessly vague and nebulous concepts like political correctness the regressive left theocractic apologism or my personal favorite cultural marxism and move on to discussing actual policy and specific examples you cant really debate political correctness because its vaguely defined it means different things to different people just like identity politics you cant discuss theocratic apologism if you arent clear on what it is you consider to be theocratic apologism and most importantly you cant tar every leftist with a brush of the extreme positions of some tiny and irrelevant fringe particularly when those positions almost certainly have nothing to do with leftist politics
most of the article reads like pseudoacademic gobbledegook full of big sounding words that actually mean bugger all this whole ideology emerged from the least rigorous quarters of academia so its unsurprising its chock full of arcane jargon and dogma whats remarkable is how much traction it has gained among the young just goes to show many people still crave religion
despite the existence of large numbers of whitewingers in the us who think milo yappynopolous is the greatest thing since sliced bread most americans know nothing or virtually nothing about him and arent interested in learning
and you have just dismissed all the views you dont agree with as crap to justify the guardians comment decision online equivalent of campus students noplatforming speakers whose views they disagree with on that note freedom of speech and expression is not just about the state but also serves to protect religions and minority social groups from the will of the majority you have also given a very partisan response in painting and i might say very illiberally a certain strain of conservative argument as not worthy of being represented fine alls fair in love and war and your side won a little battle this week why not celebrate your victory rather than saying that the conservatives have betrayed their own but then that would reflect back badly on the guardians position on censorship this week not even to be debated
there is an issue about definition here we seem to be suffering from description inflation when people used to discover it was raining before they went out the reaction would have been a stoic oh well a bit of rain never hurt anyone now its omg i hate rain i even encountered a colleague recently who declared that she was offended because an actor in a tv programme had the wrong geographical accent so given that offence can be taken by a different inflection in a vowel it becomes difficult to take the thats offensive accusation seriously while ther are clearly some things that people can say now that would have been beyond the pale oooh errr in times gone by often to do with christian leaders andor scatological terms there are many things that used to be commonplace that someone or some group has now declared to be unacceptable and we can be sure that in years to come the landscape will shift again i would suggest that the simplest solution would be for individuals to choose not to be offended that might involve having enough selfesteem to know that the offender actually words are mostly just insults is wrong an irredeemably nasty person drunk or is merely trying to provoke a reaction or it could be to accept that we arent perfect many of us are fat ugly dim or bald but that it doesnt matter or alternatively to simply calm down and ignore itand when on the receiving end of an accusation of being offensive one should also be able to reflect on the comment apologise if necessary but possibly come to the conclusion that the accuser was wrong
pretty much
why not
this is basically about whether people should have the freedom to hate and to express that hatredpeople hate all sorts of things mondays trump coriander but being the recipient of someones hatred can be anything from mildly insulting to indescribably traumatic it strikes me that many people are either more easily offended these days or they like to state publically that something someone has said has offended them people may way say something that you or i may find offensive however we have not personally been offended by itthere are occasions where one person absolutely offends another and in  of these cases the offender is making a statement about that individual specifically however i now read many articles where the author claims to have been personally offended when the remark make was a general one whichj may or may not be offensive the problem with this is that what one person might find offensive another may notmoving on to the now more prevalent use of words such as racist etc it appears that this has now become the fall back position for some when they want to shut down discussion on certain topics there should be open discussion about all topics and where someones views do not agree with those that you or i hold it does not automatically mean they are racist although many would wish to silence the view by using such languageif something is offensive to you or i then we should be able to clearly state why we believe it is offensive but it does not mean we are personally offended
i think she should have the right to use whichever word she uses to best get her point across
how you arrange your social interactions is entirely up to you and not germane to this discussion
i think its fairly safe to say that censorship and propaganda originated in reactionary govts mainly authoritarian monarchies and then under dictatorships im willing to argue that any dictatorship with censorship propaganda and loads of control freakery is always right wing whatever it calls itself that most definitely goes for uncle joe the liberal progressive left has always supposed to have a tendency towards openness sharing and tolerance but much of that was just a smokescreen as a lot of feminism has shown with its all girls rooms and stuff no different from the gentlemens clubs at all and the whole victimhood as control freak manipulation thing but its getting much worse in my view or appears to be take the remain campaign which though i was brexit but without a vote i really believed remain would win even the irish got a vote on it if they lived in blighty im british and didnt but they utterly utterly fucked it up first off they played the we are the progressive liberal intelligentsia and therefore infinitely superior to the knuckle draggers who are against the eu we will win by an osmosis of smug so there is entirely no need whatsoever to address any of the concerns that anyone may have about the eu they are untermenschen and safely dismissed pooh pooh peasant out of my way this was the first phase of the campaign up until they saw there actually was a chance they might losethen they spent the rest of the campaign screaming liar panic the world will end racist chav and issuing blood curdling screams about how the untermenschen would destroy them franky they deserved to lose by a much bigger margin they refused to deal with legitimate concerns especially amongst the working classes who feel alienated in the past decade and left behind which is pretty much the case as they are openly despised by the majority of the middle class liberal left that this paper personifies
i believe there is a right to offend the trouble is the hypocrisy of those who do say offensive things is that they dont like the same when they are offended i find religion offensive but i would not want the religious to have a voice i find trump offensive but really his response to criticism shows him for what he is hypocritical when holocaust deniers are denied their right to say this it is because they are telling lies not because they are offensive which they may be to some facts are sacred opinion is just that
derogatory descriptions of people with opposing views these are used to silence people inferring that their opinions are irrelevant or less worthy but in fact is also a construct to divert blame andor get rid of dissent ffs suck it up
what a vile creature she is that she is even given a public platform to peddle her disgusting highly provocative views is an extremely poor reflection on sections of the media in this country
you suggesting the other poster is privileged is a microaggression that seeks to devalue their argumentopinion check and mate
well said
you cannot give people the right to be offended it is at best a totally iffy concept is offence even a real thing it is not a recognised emotion as far as i am aware it seems to me more like a word that has been invented to validate our dislike of something it shifts the onus from us to someone else its your fault you offended me get over it we need thicker skins in these times not to have cotton wool wrapped around us

thanks for enlightening me
or those sick and twisted enough to gain pleasure from deliberately causing distress to others eg the aforementioned katie hopkins
i have not the slightest idea what youre talking about the first amendment is currently in force  as its always been
if you feel strongly that you have not been able to freely discuss immigration because of association with racists and xenophobes you should try distancing yourself from them i really dont know what you mean by that i am distant from them
cool maybe ill try it later to someones face and see where it gets me when they punch me ill just keep shouting first amendment while justifying it because bradster off the internet thinks i shouldnt think before i open my mouth
this subject seems to be the hot topic at the momentlots of navel gazing and going round in circlesi tend to think that the events of the last year have emboldened certain people to suddenly believe that their views are no longer seen as unacceptable sweeping generalisations about anyone who voted brexit being racist are as ridiculous as the belief that all remainers are liberal elitists or leftiesthe problem lay in the inability to form an opinion beyond the narrow confines of what passes for news these daysconsequently we get ideologues feverishly clasping onto their beliefs without the ability to even acknowledge that things are rarely as simple as they would like them to bewhen there is intransigence and a refusal to engage is when the name calling starts and the situation becomes more divisivehaving said that there are some fucking idiots out there 
i agree with you i would defend anyones right to speech so long as they are not trying to incite violence id like to know what gave you the idea i did not im not mad but i would like to clear up any misconceptions i may have given
you dont see how political correctness can be dangerous i refer you to cases in rotherham and sweden where police didnt go after rape gangs out of fear of being labeled racist citations
ive increasingly come to believe that the way forward is that rather than try and forge political correctness into some kind of shield we should instead fight fire with fire hit back at the right with words that offend them make they cry foul and declare our speech off limits and were partway to either defining acceptable limits or agreeing there are none and fighting on an equal footing thats why i think labour have actually done the right thing with their punchy leaflets about infant mortality in copeland and its why i refer to breitbart as the goto news outlet for failed school shooters we need to grab them by the lapels join them in gutter and hit them the same way they hit us the age of going high when they go low is over
i so harmed by it that ill probably go and riot somewhere besides i need some new trainers
on the face of it your comments appear reasonable but it doesnt take much analysis of various phrases that you use to see where problems would arise for example civilised society common decency i do wish people who use the term political correctness pejoratively would at least take the time to reflect and consider why such a phrase is needed in the first place it is all too easy and intellectually lazy not to consider members of other groups of society in ones speech being aware of this is only the first step in acceptance of others
youre so confused on one hand you say freedom of dissent should be protected but you support the idea of no platforming you cant have them both yes you can how can it be difficult to understand that the freedom to say something out loud doesnt equate to the freedom to say it on a podium in a lecture hall you dont own
we have rightwing people being prevented from speaking publicly having social media accounts shut down being beaten up in the street for voting trump the rights hands arent clean either but the illiberal wing of the left seems to be the main problem at the moment
where was i complaining
the thing is that we dont always have a right to express opinions the law cant legislate for what people think but when people use public platforms including internet forums to incite others to acts of terrorism or just spew hatred based on ethnicitysexualitygender etc then we rightly have laws against this theyre hard to enforce admittedly but theyre there anyway i totally accept that we all have a right to an opinion but when i express an opinion that say donald trumps opinion on a given subject is total bullshit id like to think that in a civilised society this wouldnt be seen as controversial the worrying thing is that increasingly any dissenting voice against rabid right wingers is met with a howl of indignant outrage and finger pointing and whataboutery never constructive debate i dont think ive ever seen political discourse as polarized and redundant as it is now
some rightwingers really dont like it if you point out to them that many of their number are possibly maybe struggling just a bit in the intellect department i think leftwingers hate it even more
criticism is not hate speech
indeed ive long seen many modern liberals as actual backdoor social conservatives they still want to control peoples speech beliefs what they do in the bedroom etc just with slightly different motives and different targets absolutely the psychological profile of so many of these handwringing puritans is no different from their greatgrandmothers who sat in the front pew of the church loudly singings psalms while avidly noting who was missing today who looked hungover and who might be having an affair humourless moralizing conformists who are deeply suspicious of pleasure and freedom
a confused article your point seems to be about the need for politeness and self control in discourse but you dance about it a lot and tangle yourself up in a half baked critique of freedom of speech mill makes a totally random appearance for no conceivable reason other than to add weight by association while the inclusion of the stat about young girls and intellectual brilliance opens up an entirely new vein of discussion only to close back up at the same time are you saying that youre pro free speech but would like it if people were more moderate in their use of language exercising their right to offend only when absolutely necessary if so why didnt you just talk about that
hate speech can be countered by counter speech which does not infringe freedom of press ie if amber rudd had criticised the press for the enemies of the people description she would not have been preventing them from publishing fining for publishing or in anyway impinging on their freedom but might be heard to have been condemning the kind of hate speech that leads to threats violence and divisions
i think its more complex than that but yes a good point men are more unequal than women in the uk men are still running the country and may is only the nd prime minister ever and her govt has far more men and filling top jobs whilst filling prisons the sooner masculinist studies stops worrying about not always getting the top jobs as they used to and starts seeing the whole picturethe better although the same has often been said if feminist studies of course
microagressions and racebaiting go handinhand the more alienated you make the average person feel the more vulnerable they are to sympathising with extremists ideologies
thats the problem though it can only ever be your personal line because its entirely subjective its really not
ive come to the conclusion that besides political correctness and its associated ideas of intersectionality group privileges and all that proved too complex to communicate however worthy their original intent make it so easy for those using the techniques to be just as covertly and perhaps unconsciously racist sexist and bigoted as those they criticise
who decides what is offensive if someone calls me a poopoo head and i find that an outrageous offence and harmful should that be a hate crime language and offence cant be band at the extreme end because you would soon find that things like the life of brian is banned or making jokes about christians its bad enough that if you make the same jokes about muslims you are likely to be accused of islamophobia or incitement of hatred when all you are doing is shining a light on just another inconsistent abusive bigoted idea which all abrahamic religions are all ideas should be open to criticism particularly religion
because if it isdo me a favour
definitely i have a strong dislike for many different ideologies but if they were noplatformed id be one of the first to call out the bullshit for what it is noplatforming is bullshit so freedom is speech is also the unrestricted right to speak from any platform no matter who owns that platform
everyone should be free to say and think whatever they like what you should have said is that people are not free to say whatever they want either they are free to say whatever they want or not i think history shows us quite clearly enough that they should not be free to say whatever they want which is what you are saying in your first line in addition i would add that your comment as a whole is inconsistent and contains the usual liberal dilemma which liberals suffer from when dealing with their free speech and nazis
but then dont be so hypocritical as to complain when others do the same
in the words of jeff goldblums character in jurassic park they are so preoccupied with whether they could they didnt stop to think if they should im not saying people should be prevented from saying such unpleasant things but there should be an element of human decency which hopkins and her ilk should adhere to these people find that its perfectly reasonable to insult people who have done nothing to be insulted for and to make the lives of ordinary people difficult if not very unpleasant the problem is that by exercising their freedom of speech although it may have exposed the flaws in their argument too many people adhere to their simplistic and sweeping narratives i think people dont realize that freedom of speech is something to be respected its a powerful right and therefore something that should be used responsibly
some rightwingers really dont like it if you point out to them that many of their number are possibly maybe struggling just a bit in the intellect department freedom of speech doesnt seem so essential all of a sudden
likewise the students are free to go and hear the speaker elsewhere why should they go elsewhere what if the vast majority of people want to hear the speaker after all theyre students and for the purposes of education many of them may want to hear the speakers arguments the point of going to university is to get out of your comfort zone and be challenged testing your arguments against an opponent is the best way to improve your understanding of a subject if some people dont want to hear a person speak then they can make sure they dont attend that speech thats much easier to do
fair point its a pretty ironic term given their methods but i agree we need to distinguish them from liberals when theyre basically the antithesis
the balance of power is important even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impact student activists dont have the ability to stop highprofile journalists writing what they damn well please however much they might wish it were otherwise theres a debate to be had about how we think about and define free speech people use this to judge the left in general it does a great deal of harm to people pushing to change class balance of this country that is so egregiously tilted against working people they see this kind of rubbish as a long term goal of the left and that groups like labour and smaller leftist parties are more interested in minority rights than the workers the damage is scarred deep into our politics as ukip and the tory right there is a reason that the guardian and its core readerswriters are comfortable with this while the mirror is not and it also the whole focus on sexualitygenderrace as the key issue of the left sets up some of socities most advantaged people as victims when class is by some distance the biggest issue
the horrid horrid americans have a much better definition of free speech you can say anything in the usa you cant actually the first amendment protects a lot of speech but there are still defamation laws in the us for example the right to state ones opinion is protected but not the right to publish facts that one knows to be false thereby harming the reputation of another
wrong let me enlighten you hate crime statutes here in the us have nothing to do with the first amendment hate speech does not exist as a concept in first amendment jurisprudence here in the us you are free to be as big a racist homophobe or bigot as you like the first amendment has you covered youre welcome
so youre not too keen on freedom of speech then ok fair enough
as long as you hate the correct bogeymen as selected by the president and his cothugs
perhaps you could explain what you mean
impact impact always bloody impact the word is effect
free speech is very important in a modern democracy but it must not be abused unfortunately it is and by leaders especially on the right trump serves the right to be offensive but then with boundless hypocrisy attacked the media for doing its job and reporting on stuff that he does not liketrump is a troll as are many others like katie hopkins they feed on outrage outrage leads to more coverage and attention and gives them an even greater platform in the modern age we have an unholy mix of show business politics and the internet which has led to people like who use it their own ends the problem is that trump and his like pollutes our lives their negativity hate and incivility pollutes the airwaves on tv online and it is difficult to get a way from their example will be copied as it has been proven to win right trump and others abuse free speech it is too difficult to draw up rules as to what is and what is not allowed and so most all must the most extreme must be allowed sure we have a choice not to listenbut that is increasingly difficult given that trump is now the president of the us and extreme right wing is now the mainstream they pollute our lives and we collectively are losing our collective will to say enough we are increasingly fractured and tribal because of course that is what leaders like trump want keep us divided and confused keep us reeling and awe will not be able to protest and join together to say as a collective that this is not the world we want
not a fan of political correctness not a fan of language policing and a big fan of free speech the things is though if you have genuine concerns and you genuinely want people to listen to you you need to speak in a language that they will listen to no one has a right not to be offended but similarly no one has a right to be listened to
oh so that makes abusive language which doesnt lead to physical violence ok then
hmmm i cant give you a definite answer to that at the moment why not is it a matter of not knowing your own opinion or do you think you need to check what kind of backlash the law allows
ah but you see that is righteous hate speech and is on the right side of history s

i didnt say that wrong comment
if any language can be changed through legislation my guess is that german is the most likely candidate they have done it with the spelling with varying success
i use teilnehmende participant and so on the problem with that partial solution is that it works only in the plural die studierenden fine but what if there is a hypothetical one who could be of either gender you then get der studierende or die studierende which is no advance on der student die studentin your post suggests that you have not grasped the finer points of german grammar teilnehmende participants die teilnehmenden the participantsder teilnehmende the male participantein teilnehmender a male participantdie teilnehmende the female participanteine teilnehmende a female participant
keine actually all nounds ending in schaft are feminine as are ei ik and ung to name a few
do you really think getting rid of the grammatical gender bit is going to change one jot of this guys attitude towards women if youve been studying german nigh on nine years and still have trouble getting your head around it i have a couple of suggestions you may be surprised that after one year complete immersion the pieces really will just come together if you avoid hanging out with people who insist on using their english around you oryou may just be one of those people who really have difficulty learning a foreign languagemy mother was one of those and nothis does not make you a stupid person you will probably achieve a very good working command of german and that is really all that is necessary unless you are planning on actually teaching the language
come back when youve grown up
god i really hope they scrap the gendered articles theyre a bloody waste of time to learn
pie in the sky because casebase languages need gender for the sentences to make sense as the position in the sentence doesnt make it clear who is doing what to whom compare den mann biss der hund with das mann biss das hund its also important for agreement when there are lots of nouns in a sentence so dont get your hopes up when referring to people i do find this xinnen solution very cumbersome and ugly i try to avoid it by using a broader noun instead of die musikalische leiterin try die musikalische leitung in context it is normally clear you are referring to an individual and not a group the article mentions the verby way round with liebe studierende otherwise just remember heit keit ung feminine and then try seeing if den or das sounds better in accusative to differentiate between masculine a neutral ich lege das buch auf denaufs tisch den just sounds right whereas das tisch and der tisch kind of sound the same and youre off to a good start having said all that they can get rid of the silly genitive case meinentwegen p

graffiti in berlin c rheinlӓnder aus auslӓnder rein
its actually rather fewer than  some of the articles are overloaded as we say in software engineering filing more than one of the  combinations like der and den just makes the whole thing sillier in my opinion since they do not even provide unambiguous guidance cases fulfil a concrete grammatical role but genders in german really are as good as arbitrary

yes it would make a nice verb but it doesnt currently exist
im studying at evening class in the swiss ibw school at the moment and they use studierende in communications far preferable we had one sewer of a lecturer who made disparaging comments about women at work when the female students were out of earshot i think the school has dropped him after a barrage of complaints but sadly not about this particular failing
silly article yes of course  plattdeutsch and for that matter dutch have the article de for masculine and feminine although in dutch there are it seems to me phantom limbs that show a previous distinction and  germans occasionally make grammatical gender flubs probably more related to dialect than anything else but you cant just tell people to do away with gender distinctions in languages that evolves over time or more often doesnt as in is the case with all the romance or slavic languages one issue is that gender helps to clarify the syntax of sentences with multiple nouns to see what agrees with what what is the antecedent of what the really interesting question is why english and dutch and plattdeutsch simplified not why there are still genders in lots of at least indoeuropean languages probably for english if it was the collision of germanic and romance genders that happened after  but i dont know the history of it
studying german at uni right now and ill hopefully be doing a year abroad in berlin as well and i so hope that german simplifies itself you can teach yourself a lot of rules in language but after learning german for nigh on  years i still constantly mess up articles for unfamiliar words which means marks lost sentences mangled and germans laughing at you
i just got it from this kindervers ein männlein steht im walde ganz still und stummes hat von lauter purpur ein mäntlein umsagt wer mag das männlein seindas da steht im wald alleinmit dem purpurroten mäntelein das männlein steht im walde auf einem beinund hat auf seinem haupte schwarz käpplein kleinsagt wer mag das männlein seindas da steht im wald alleinmit dem kleinen schwarzen käppelein das männlein dort auf einem beinmit seinem roten mänteleinund seinem schwarzen käppeleinkann nur die hagebutte sein for some reason the rosehip is likened to a männlein

hmm as ive always said you can teach someone to pronounce written german aloud correctly literally in  minutes but teaching them to writespeak it takes rather longer how fondly i recall the  ways to say the
hang on in there its a beautiful language dont give up
the thing is im sure people _were_ happy that you were trying to speak in german however if youre trying to have an actual conversation it becomes rather grating for the native speaker if the other one butchers their language i actually think this causes the native speaker to listen more to how you say something than what youre actually saying whereas switching to english as a common nonnative language brings in a level of abstraction where mistakes are forgiven more easily from both sides
did anyone else try studying esperanto at school what was that all about
i have yet to meet anyone in germany whod say konfitüre in real life marmelade it is here and there
it is a very precise language i agree but look how good the germans are at engineering dont you think theres a connection there with the precision of the language i do when the germans engineer things they see to every detail nothing less than perfection will do
johann wolfgang von goethe would be spinning in his grave now if he knew what was being proposed looks like the hosts of school pupils i taught for  years were quite prescient in their use of de whenever they failed to appreciate the finer points of german gender i used to hear some older germans refer to english as being a negergrammatik because of its relative simplicity
eine freundin von mir usually seemed to work unlike die freundin von mir
dont take it so badly euphobia i wasnt trying to put you down i was merely putting you right i believe you when you say you made a mistake it is so simple to make one when writing on the internet but i really do have to disagree with you when you say that using four cases makes germans feel superior i dont think that has anything to do with it its simply how the language has developed i should also like to point out to you that germans correcting you at the time you were learning the language was probably a sign of their help i know that when i learnt german i was corrected incessantly i always took that in a positive way after all i wanted to learn their language and being a bit of a perfectionist myself i wanted to learn it properly it is clear to me that such attention to detail in grammar especially when learning such a structured language as german is absolutely necessary if the learner wants to be successful its part and parcel of the learning process
you may be right that german could be easier but for native speakers like me a change of language would be nonsenseits fact that german is not german there are so many regional differences in vocabulary and grammarno one me included will accept a change of language in  austria joined the eu and had to adjust the vocabulary through legislation in many words eg jam in austria marmelade in germany konfitüre nobody in austria uses the word konfitüre since then it is the same with other wordsif you change anything in the german language i cant imagine that change will happen
why not just drop the female forms of these words and change the article to neutral english is slowly doing this by dropping the ess of ienne off females who do certain jobs or is solution grammatically ugly to native speakers as someone who is learning german though id love it if you abandoned changing die to der in dative makes learning the arbitrary genders of words very difficult if not paying attention properly
they do it in a simple way the spanish pc politicians and the local feminazis are compelling people to use two words españoles y españolas profesores y profesoras funny enough many descriptive words in spañish end with a a the usual female termination so no need to use two words for jurista lawyer in this case they accept the use of a common word they do not demand to use juristo male end in spanish a silly waste of time and energy just for the holy pc new religion

never going to happen changing a language by legislation doesnt work they tried to reform ortography not the language itself mind you just minor rules on writing back in in  yet people are still struggling so much with it that they just resigned and let both old and new versions be valid and im not a big fan of institutions like the académie française either language has to come from and evolve with the people it just wouldnt work in a lingual area with so many local dialects and varieties like the germanosphere for example in my native bavarian dialect the genitiv case and simple past dont exist replaced with dative forms and perfect while we have some other very specific rules others dont have eg the wife of someone called der gruber might just be called die gruberin just like in slavic languages where you append an a to the surnames of women and some words even have different genders than in standard german hell we even arbitrarily assign pronouns to foreign words and stick with the one that sounds right for example the computer gets a der while software gets a die and the motherboard a das i agree its not easy for nonnative speakers but i dont think  million native speakers are willing to change their rules overnight just to make things a bit easier for learners besides one does not meet gender equality by forcing a language to give up on pronouns and rules which have evolved over hundreds of years as the author himself already pointed out it has always been consensus addressing a group of people by the masculine plural form without anyone feeling left out and as far as i know none of my fellow students male or female or in between feel left out or even offended when they address us with liebe studenten if you want a language that completely complies with your worldview the only sure way is to invent one yourself
please note i write using an experimentl spellin perhaps the most difficult to deal with is eliminatin the ess ov the rd person singular ov the present simple does changes to do makes to make etc many linguists question whether language can be changed through human will do this sentence mean that meny linguists think that languages wer not inventid by humans but by i dunno other animals machines god himself with the federal justice ministry emphasising that all state bodies should stick to genderneutral formulations in their paperwork things are changing again languages are living things so change is natural for them however the internet make it possibl for us ordinary peepl to activly participate in how our language evolvs or remains the same between you and me thare are no grammer or spellin censors this is remarkabl because in preinternet days thare wer always such censors calld editors to control how we wrote not only do the internet make this sort ov discussion possibl a big blow for freedom for all as opposed to freedom for the select few we can also openly experiment with our language its grammer spellin and vocabulary thareby making it democratic sumthing which it never was befor internet i am makin use ov this to experiment with spellin in english as an english teacher i teach what is correct although i also freely criticise all the terribl errors in english but as a private citizen i now hav the freedom to do this the werld we liv in today is very different to the werld when our languages wer first spoken so it is only natural that our languages change to remain in tune with the different werld we now liv in and internet mean we can be activly engaged in this women hav been out ov the picture for centurys and this is reflectid in language and so this need changin whether this is easy or not is another issue i tend to use she instead ov he or sheshe or he i remember co was suggestid as a neutral rd person singular subject pronoun meny decades ago but it never caught on
i dont know where you got that from michael ive never heard that its a mythological expression but to most native german speakers a männlein is just a small and probably not very masculine man
ooh cheeky
noone is seriously suggesting that its about writing liebe kolleginnen und kollegen when addressing both sexes

interestingly in many indoiranian languages there is no usage of genders or articles and the order of grammar could be applied differently httpenwikipediaorgwikiindoiranian_languages
this is another ridiculous article in the vein of truly british guardian correspondents in germany by a native german who hasobviously been away from his native country too long
as twain also said in the awful german language originally a chapter in a tramp abroad where is the turnip she is on the table where is the beautiful and accomplished englishwoman it has gone to the opera
even turks care to elaborate
the french genders of the sun and moon are consistent with patriarchial values implying that power and status belong to males and females only reflect them and have a purely orbital role their reversal in german implies a holdover from prehistoric matriarchial societies that survived in the germanic languages perhaps due to the germanic tribes having been outside the periphery of roman rule either that or were overthinking a plate of beans
the german writer ingo niermann suggested a more radical version of this intervention radically simplifying the grammar of german into what he calls rededeutsch a language easier to learn than english and yet immediately intelligible to speakers of oldfashioned german his version did away with the definite article altogether
i love the ability german offers to play with wordseifer suchtwas leiden schafft a play on the words eifersucht and leidenschaft
ohi thought perhaps by sensitive you may have meant your brain or maybe your hearta rash of heat in your minda rash of heat in your heartthat sort of thing why are people sensitive latin and animals are not why are flames sensible latin and memory is not a little cs lewisgoes a long way
not sure which nationality mark alexander isbut as even my nick suggestsim a yank and i havent a clue what you are going on about when it comes to being snotty about language and peoples command of itvery few trump the native english speakers ive already mentioned my experience in germanyand i can also tell you that my husband was continually ridiculed and put down here because of his german accent although his command of english grammar was far better than that of most americans when we came back stateside to care for my elderly and ailing parents and he had to take his certification to work in his field here he did it in english and passed with flying colours it went even furthermy one son who grew up bilingual when entered here in the us into school was insulted by one of his classmates with nazi salute all the more tragic because his fathers family paid the price of helping jewish citizens flee and having the teacher defend the nonresponse to the action by thinking it was only cute
while the pc village idiot factor bumble about trying to grasp the difference between biological sex and grammatical gender which isnt obvious in german perhaps the grammar feminazis could nightmare about neutering zulu which has eight genders for them to get dewey about
the word in german for scale is waage die waage btw if you are going to try and use something to describe the act of weighing something on a scale please remember the root is the verb wiegenbecause you might just get your face slapped by the young attractive shop assistant at the green grocers if you ask her darf ich etwas bei ihnen wagen
there you are you just couldnt resist putting me right before addressing the problem that all those genders and cases make german a difficult language for foreigners your reply is exactly the reason why the english find speaking german so impossible who cares about the cases germans do it makes them feel so superior and puts us poor english off i only know about cases because i learned latin sorry i mixed it up with accusative after all these years and so kind of you to point it out thats irony we brits are very good at irony
chucklingi am aware of the origin michaelit is still worth noting that for many years it would have been taken as an insult by most men to be referred to as männlein
chucklingjust when you think you have it all down patyou hear someone from the pfalz saying ich habe gedenktorich bin gerenntand then you wonder why you learned all those irregular verb formsi actually loved it when i an american was caught between a dialogue between my former inlaws we were very close who came from kreis dithmarschen up in schleswigholstein and my second husband a native of the pfalz when they tried to outdo each other in a comic performance of their own native dialects they all spoke excellent standardised german
and i just love the text to die gedanken sind frei the lilting melody is lovely as well
hmmi was american bornand everyone knows how we are generally not liked imovery often with very good reason but i can not say i ever had that problem quite the reversei was always complimented on my efforts encouraged to use it and after years of living there if any comment was ever madeit was usually you cant possibly be american not only because my german progressed to a point where it was impossible to suppose that i myself was in fact not native german but once they realized my origin they honoured the effort and interest it took to reach such a point

only three genders did you see the new facebook gender description question
thanks for that suggestion it has been a long time since i read a tramp abroad btw benny hill also did a good job with his use of german
yesi was about to post that but glad you caught itwords borrowed from another language are to about  neuterdas
 martin lee normingtonmy sensible partsdo you mean sensitive probably yes adeborgho okay i understand you point so its not neutralising gender in language but distributing it more fairly or rather generalising it to be more fair to everybody i can see the purpose still i still dont get it maybe because im a stupid neadertal language changes by itself change society and how people will communicate and language will change by just doing nothing anybody who has lived through the last two centuries can surely recognize that just listen to the youths talking i dont understand half of it drop your cell for a couple of days everybody will think youre dead even if you walk straight by them it just seems stupid and unthoughful undemocratic and blatantly brutal to try to fix such issues by messing about with the words im supposed to say or cant say anymore because im being an ass if you want to change behavior dont try to force it by changing how im supposed to talk cause i wont even if i recommend the cause
no different than latinand try russianthat has even more casesand the inflective endings vary not only according to number case and gender but also depending on whether the ending of the base word is considered hard or softohand they have five casesukrainian actually has six cases
that would be my take too although the subject was thoroughly addressed in a graduate level university course i took in germany and that was quite some twenty years ago so hardly a new discussion give me the same rights before the law the same pay the same respect the same opportunitiesand you can she me all you like
but yes i dont speak german at all but i have some experience of similar oral gymnastics in french i simply cannot do it i sound like im trying to cough up a fur ball
go to any north german area where plattdeutsch is spoken and you will feel right at homeit is loaded with english wordsjust remember not to ask for eine flasche bier but ein buddel bier a lot of it is really geography i also spent considerable time in rheinlandpfalz where the proximity to france has greatly influenced the language

im not entirely sure what you mean here but if youre talking about the sort of asophogal rolling of rs then yes this is not popular with english speakers a french man once told me that speaking english for protracted periods actually made his throat sore
yes two languages
if you really want to tell the difference between a native german speaker and a native english speakerhave one of each sort say the relatively simple sentence of gehen wir ins bar and listen for the auslaut in the word bar more native english speaking people have trouble with that than they do with the gender issue
wer reitet da durch nacht und wind es ist der vater mit seinem kind 
south germany for example badenwuerttemberg there is a dialect called  alemannisch it is called der butter pronounced dr budder its a curious language a kind of mixture and crosses several regions i grew up in the alsace and had no problem understanding the people across the rhine french and high german i had to learn in swiss german it is dr der anke no idea why it is der i can only assume because in french it is le beurre as wellbtw a potato is not die kartoffel but der haerdoepfel earth apple
completely ignores the entire point of the article ie how the gendered language interacts with actual people instead of things or ideas there are significant movements to make changes to nouns in spanish as well especially the collective nouns that tend to default to the masculine
männlein is a mythological being in german culture but yes it is a small man

my sensible parts do you mean sensitive
but the french think the sun is male and the moon female really weird i am really sorry but i fear we will never understand them what a pity 
by the way im glad you like brits were a funny bunch

this feels like an onion article i mean surely youre not actually serious about this
laughed at this comment especially not love actually brilliant and what about dr strangelike lunch with the girls or boys not lunch with the women or men girls or boys night out women or men when youre having a good bitch and moan session about the opposite sex and so on however i do not and never have liked being called love darling darlin doll baby or sweetie by anybody except my parents or a boyfriendpartner especially by people i work with or people i dont know whether male or female eg someone serving me in shops true often no harm or insult is meant but its unprofessional and it can be used to demean dismiss or patronise someone whatever their gender one usually just knows where its really coming from in a given situation for those who always seem to try and make these discussions into a feminist plot or who rail against pc its nothing to do with either both women and men use diminutives as the author says its about context
if it was offensive it would be wrong my language is very simiar to yours except my male friends are the lads but i cant see how anyone could take offence at your language or mine however with women to whom i am not as close i am cautious in my use of casual terms of endearment if they call me love darling etc i see that as a compliment and will often return it
as suggested by larry david i wouldnt like to be in the same restaurant if a premature honey was ever directed at the author

theres a market for a modern etiquette book out there i mean its a bloody minefield how not to cause offence in an age where everyone is determined to be offended if i start tonight it might be ready for the xmas market 
this group of older men referring to mature females as girls what would you call them a boys club i agree the way we use language is very important i agree patronising use of language should be called out i agree there is no place for language that stereotypes marginilises or constrains context however is the most important thing to consider when we choose our words the use of ladies may be seen as old fashioned the use of females may be seen as cold and clinical the use of women can present demeaning connotations as in womens work and a womans place the word girl is largely innocuous and can bring positive images of youthfulness and childish wonder my  year old mother refers to the girls at her golf club my  year old sister refers to weekends away with the girls my  year old sister refers to girls nights out personally i find paul hollywoods reference perfectly acceptable as he shares a relationship and familiarity with mary mel and sue and i would think he would choose language that none would consider offensive your man in the street was a complete stranger however so i would consider his language inappropriate even if the incident was cute and so lets go back to your opening lines when i think of paul hollywood tvs flouryhaired fox and staunch upholder of a strong crumb i think of a man who only ever seems to be one pint of bitter away from turning into your dad hitting the dancefloor at the end of a very long wedding by any judgement it seems you too are guilty of using patronising and loaded language choosing words that paint negative images and perpetuate unnecessary stereotypes paul hollywood might say you cant have your cake and eat it too
oh i hate pal it makes me want to kick whoever called me it in the face its aggression posing as chumminess
has anyone at the graun asked whether sue perkins mel giedroyc and mary berry actually mind being called the girls or any other nongirl female of a certain age and if they dont shouldnt we be told

youre my kind of gal
with names like that id use boys too 
i regularly refer to my group of male friends as the boys i dont think they would mind even though they have all seen  pass by i refer to my  strong independent daughters in their s as the girls and mostly call them darling is any of this wrong i hope not because i am bloody well going to keep on doing it i think you perceive prejudice or bias which may not be there
maybe he was smuggling an orange out of the studio canteen thieving bastard
or triggered cuck yeah
patronising possessive or not i call my minions the boys its so much easier because sometimes they have me so frazzled i cant remember their names especially on those days such as today when theres no school tomorrow and they all have made plans while on the bus coming home from school apparently they will all stop at my house a decision made by my son i would hear the school bus coming and then stops the creak of its brakes the woosh sound as the metal arms push the door open and then they all barge in saying mom were home braeden is here and jm and carson and oh hi lincoln lincoln is here too mom and we are hungry and thats when i would go boys

she was a english herself see as were all the dreadful little kiddiwinks the little beasts i also did the airport transfers one week schoolkids another middleaged mancunians they were fun that lot we had a load of irish protestants and catholics and no troubles at all public schoolboys trashed their rooms indeed they were just rude and stupid d college but their teachers nastier oh so entitled and drunk night and day into the bargain etcetc night and day real dipsos but teachers usually on a free trip were the worst terrible tippers real scrooge mcduck stuffplus they expected you to fetch and carry bow and scrapei just ignored them at the bar until they got the message teachers  the worst behaved though animals really trying to pour supermarche supermarket wine into their glasses at the inexpensive bar best job i ever had the bar was my fiefdom and i its lord plus free skiing boose etc and in those days you could smoke at the bar tres civilise incidentally i dont see why my being a feminist and proud of it at that should provoke such bitter responses from some i suppose its jealousy i later went on to become a leading light in the cause while at university although these days i am more of a radical feminist so maybe thats too strident or uppity for the meek orthodoxy of mainstream feminism well hard lines
 plus names though thats when words like guys creep in
perhaps for some the term snowflake
thats ok kitten talking bollocks isnt gendered funnily enough
if youre talking to a filly or a bitch girl isnt necessarily condescending or sexist giddy up sailor
these articles are the guardians contribution to keeping people in touch with la la land
now that is offensive
it does have regional difference too from a merseyside point of view its just normal lingo to be referred to as the lads and the girls regardless of age and the real test is to read intent behind the use of a phrase personally i feel uncomfortable using but accepting of it when receiving because i use judgement of their intent to know sense its friendliness i wouldnt go as far as the author in forming a judgement about a set of relationships i cant begin to appreciate without experiencing those relationships first hand
good questions yeah it is more recent but it bothered me before as the term was used professionally and i disagree with the second thing you said because that is just basic job description regardless of anything else
you tell em girl
thats not his bulge his jeans are so tight hes given himself a hernia
girl isnt an offensive word so nobody should be reprimanded for using it if feminists want to alter and and mangle the english language theyll only find support from other pc sorts the problems women face dont include harmless affectionate terms to describe them and by trivialising sexism by highlighting something nonsensical like this they distract from important issues which will have a harder time gaining the coverage it deserves because men will associate all feministsexist issues with the banality the left foster upon us and anything important they have to say will fall on deaf ears because men wont wanna deal with the complaining and self pity
you should try being  years old amp an acad mic professor amp being called doll by a phd student
its the term girlie i dont like
i am a teacher and hate that our teaching assistants are often referred to as the ladies even though we now have a male ta it creates a weird separation in the job role from a teacher two things spring to mind  it seems the male ta is recent so wasnt ladies descriptive for a group of er ladies isnt calling them teaching assistants creating a weird separation from the role teacher 
i live near sheffield as well and theres nothing offensive about those terms i like them its all about context though a few years back i managed an older man and the way he used girl to refer to me was definitely disrespectful and undermining he made it clear at every opportunity that he didnt respect me because i was so young im in my thirties hardly a child so yeahcontext is everything
dodgy fetishism
and my sons and all their male friends call each other bro

we all know that females have to work ten times as hard to prove themselves within male hierarchies elaine or can i call you el do you have any proof for that claim

lol
its usually older males and generally i shrug it off they mean no harm and are just a product of their timeshowever language shapes our culture and such terms are depersonalising stereotypical and lacking in respect for individuals particularly in any professional context in that environment they remove any acknowledgement of status and skills and we all know that females have to work ten times as hard to prove themselves within male hierarchies without being subtly undermined by casual language
 lets not get carried away here there are more important things like brexit i love that this article is producing so many comedy comments
lets not get carried away here there are more important things like brexit that should take up authors and readers and feminists timeat my workplace the women are occasionally and informally referred to as the girls and the men likewise as the boys and i cant see what is wrong in that it is like guys n gals which i suppose is also sexist the interaction between men and women is guided by social norms and rules you can not put that in writing the problem is elsewherea management that puts lids on the dirty linen work products and does not have a policy of openness and transparency is what causes the social climate to grow infestedbut the whole issue is only really discussed in british and us msm its not being really discussed on the continent
well to be fair they probably get paid by the word something offends but not always context see common sense isnt going to pay many bills
a commentator called our new prime minister in new zealand chicky babe it wasnt a good idea
ah sod that shes shaved it off yes i need a hobby
haha i wasnt sure if a better representation of hair would be ampampamp for curly or www sod it shes not sure either and has shaped it appropriately 
do you have any similar stories expressing outrage between a male and female interacting in a similar manner in an eating establishment or better yet two women that makes it alright see
well at least you admit its weird
you find love creepy love
where i live sheffield people call each other love and darling all of the time irrespective of gender it is merely a term of endearment and has nothing to do with oppression of anyone my biggest worry is when people call me duck its puzzling as i am more whalelike and look nothing like waterfowl
as a person born without cheeks i find your remark incredibly insensitive allow me to delineate boringly my preferences
patronising aside a lot of people never seem to really grow up so girl and boy are appropriatemyself includedwho would want to
ah meaning
i had to firmly ask a schoolteacher on a ski trip with kids i was the barman at the hotel in france to please not call me love quite right bad example for the kids the teacher should have used mon amour
being called sunshine really gets up my nose always has it is a condescending derogatory phrase bloke i dislike bloke but i dont mind you as in oi you thing is most of these naff phrases guys horrible term ropes used to hold up tents sounds a lot more attractive somehow evoke the stereotypical image of a londoner accented geezer in a white ford branded clothing and coiffured hair day stubble and one eye on the mirror for his good side what i term a prat funny that
not an understatement
it was probably a farage sock rolled up
i often call staff at my business things like mate bud mucker flower petal and lar being a riding school we sometimes have pupils or their parents who can quite literally be on their high horse and look down their noses at stable hands and other staff i usually refer to these people as nobcheese fckfeatures twtface and bumsnot but not to their faces obviously 
the other day someone told me off for using the word feisty yikes sounds like encountering a guardian commenter in actual real life terrifying
nice spread this is like pornographic hieroglyphics lol
spot on dunphy cratylus is my hero and guide in all social situations
one persons opinion fine but a group of women out for what theyd call a hen night will always call themselves girls now we all know an old lady a nice dignified person but an old woman oh dear no lets copy the usa and look for euphemisms not exactly an equal country for women is it no right to paid maternity leave just for example nor does all this stuff translate into other languages
best comment so far 
how dare they assume gender tell them it was a woman though im absolutely sure from the last time i checked
yeah build a bridge no seriously more young women should be encouraged to become civil engineers itll also help couthify the more uncivil male engineers
its the differences that are valuable
it explored the idea that pupils were treated differently depending on their gender often unthinkingly one male primary school teacher called the girls love and darling and the boys fella and mate it concluded fairly convincingly that it provides a better start for everyone if the language used for girls doesnt imply that they are cute and small and sweet and the language used for boys doesnt suggest that they are strong and macho and stoic why not run an experiment half the classes in a series of schools or to minimize contamination alternate schools but that introduces potential bias from different school policies so probably split classes within schools is best and in one third of the classes call the girls love and darling an the boys mate and fella good grief and in one third of classes reverse this for the male and female children with girls called mate and fella and the boys love and darling in the remaining third of classes use gender neutral terms such asyou and thingy and kid and sprog after one academic year look at which classes have the best levels of interpersonal behaviour lowest bullying and least genderspecific behaviours eg toy preference dressing up clothing preference etc should be interesting trying to persuade the parents this is the most scientific way to determine how best to raise their kids alternatively you could just use the childs name
an adult knows when something is childish nonsense
the police wanted to know if the suspect was male or female so i slammed the phone down in a rage at such a fascist question
yes its called thinking about yourself in the world like an adult whos properly mindful and takes responsibility for their behaviours dull but true
what a very strange discussion i mean fair enough if this is an issue for new national anthems but the the dutch national anthem is more than  years old it was written in the name of william of orange and is basically about how he is loyal to his religion rather to the spaniards so whats the verdict then guardian is it sexist
if you sing the anthem in your mother tongue doesnt that make it more feminine
anthems are historical on the whole and so will be old fashioned by definitionthat is the point of them isnt it to connect to our pasti am always interested to know why some people feel that they are so important and that the current generation is so important that they can just change an anthem or flag or national symbol to fit in with the politics of their particular time as if that is more important than the historical contextgod save the queen the uk national anthem and royal anthem of new zealand canada and australia has many things wrong with it it is also the worlds oldest and first national anthem the one that all the others copied and adapted how self important do you have to be to look at a piece of heritage like that and want to change it to meet your own biases
someone has way too much time on their hands whats next i suggest tracing sexism in instruction manuals
it should be imaginary entity save our privileged few
since when is god save the queen the english national anthem it is british national anthem but it certainly isnt the english one england does not have an official anthem though jerusalem based on william blakes great poem is widely acceptedwhat a naff articleand god save the queen is genderneutral according to the gs hacks
it was originally god save the king and will be again much like the beach boys regendering and then he kissed me
you wait til charles in on the throne the guardian will be having conniptions about being asked to sing in support of the patriarchy
no im not youre posting to get a nice feeling of your own smugness laughing at people who think harder about the world than you do and have a better sense of humour
definitely too much time on your hands guys
hen wlad fy rhieni doesnt really scan otechestvo is neuter and otchizna is feminine although both mean fatherland
peak
the austrian one is quite interesting in itself despite being humungously boring to sing its one of the few to have been written by a woman paula preradovic won a prize competition for her text a few years ago her sons tried to sue the austrian state for royalties arguing they should be paid each time its sung or broadcast they lost
kazoos its obviously the way forward
you are confusing critical thinking with navel gazing
i love that you have chosen the uk as gender neutral with not one mention of the lyric god save the queen the matriarchy
god save the queen is pretty one sided
we may be gender neutral but our anthem is only about one person with a tune that my sevenyear old could better the russian anthem has always sent shivers down my spine no idea what they are singing but it surely ticks all the boxes for a national anthem with the scottish referendum i did have high hopes that we could dump our infantile ditty once and for all but sadly it wasnt to be i am frankly ashamed of our national anthem its bloody awful
yawn theres always one who finds critical thinking scary and has no sense of the absurd
you may picture editor wish to compare the traditional number of stars on the australian flag with those in the top right photo and review the caption accordingly
shouldnt the guardian also be concerned with how national anthems neglect mention of transgendered people people of transgender and there are more than just two genders you know
australia not new zealand
as manufacturing industry declined in the west i realised that people would start doing some very peculiar jobs twenty years ago young people would have left school at sixteen and happily spot welded washing machines together for eight hours a day nowadays they go to university and write articles like this
the guardian is fast becoming a parody of itself next week sexist bank notes and coin around the world followed by how outrageously sexist is teabag packaging
thats not the australian flag not new zealand
say what you will against the russians their national anthem kicks ass and their generals have the coolest hats
in the st century the real question is which is the most sexist vegetable
thats going to be a challenge with one less bitch by nwa or anything at all by acdc
so if the uk is gender neutral shouldnt it be god save the monarch
i would be interesting to see anthems plotted along a continuum of religious to secular using the number of references to deities im afraid the outcome will be rather lopsided
hold on tight folks were at peak guardian
even turks learn to speak german now for years they always asked me at he dönershop mit alles i did not understand nowadays they ask mit allem
my point is that it is pointless and irrational to assign arbitrary genders to objects that have no gender no matter how many languages do that to all things in the universe this is still pointless and irrational everybody has to choose which things out of a universe of things they will choose to learn be it german or quantum mechanics or whatever one could argue that by not learning lion taming is limiting and though theyd be correct we cant all be lion tamers
fashions that peoples nature as well indeed dutch is something of a halfway housebut what happens with all the casesdemwem etc
both a ship and a bell are usually referred to as shealong with a few other apparently gender neutral things which somehow have retained their original gendersso we do still have wisps of the old gender cobwebs even in english
zu meinen ohren klingt das fürchterlich
high and low german fascinating
fräulein is falling out of usage mädchen is a common word and i very much doubt any mädchen is even aware that theyre in a neutral gender germans just know what sounds right and what doesnt without pondering the grammar
ill try my best for you basically the gender of nouns tends to follow a pattern of course there are always exceptions but it can be said for example that the endings of words always have the same gender let me give you a few examples nouns ending in ung are feminine words words ending in chen a diminutive are always neuter as are words ending in lein as in das männlein the little man and fräulein little woman ie a young girl words ending in keit are always feminine as in männlichkeit masculinity and persönlichkeit personality and so it goes on as i said there are always exceptions or anomalies as there are in most if not all languages i see nothing objectionable in this at all it is the nature of the language and thats it if you object to this then all i can say is dont learn the language but one thing i can assure you once you get your head around these things german is a very beautiful and logical language spoken well and correctly it is not hard at all on the contrary spoken well and depending on the voice of the individual speaker german can sound very mellifluous indeed
the trouble with that kind of precision is when it leaves no choice but to repeat old preconceptions over and over if you want to or not the male forms of almost all professions being the neutral one just carries on the fact that for a long time women were just not allowed to work as say a doctor so its der arzt and die ärztin with arzt being the generic form sometimes i think it would be just fair to turn that around and use the female forms of everything maybe for a hundred or two hundred years if the form really doesnt matter at all as many men seem to think or at least pretend well no problem then but if it does matter well fairs fair i am german and i always found this amusing and a great way to be creative i actually prefer to call angela merkel die bundeskanzel the federal pulpit
it means hands off got it 
stick to such excellent languages as japanese but make sure you use the female form of japanese and not the male
endlich my favourite lifelong frustration 
indeed if english didnt have genders it wouldnt require the word she or indeed he it would suffice
nonsense we know the rules in general
we dont have ablativeonly nominative genitiv dativ and akkusativ if a german tells you something he really means what he says quite sure 
really like where
my theory to this is as followsdas means hands offdas kind das weib das mädchen das haus das auto got it
das mann und das frau geht mit das kind in das moschee
i do remember at high school i gradually got a sort of dim intuitive inkling of some rationale behind the genders of german nouns yet i never did really get a proper rationale for it could you explain
please explain why in your opinion fork knife and spoon is the most absurd example do you mean as opposed to the logical he the table or she the door or the glaringly obvious he the cabbage and she the sausage by their very nature theres no logic to grammatical genders at all which by the way still doesnt make any language that uses such genders fucked up or stupid and im afraid whoever told you that joghurt could be any gender must have been having you on of course its he the yoghurt come on anything else would just be ridiculous
oh i just saw where i confused you my editing was crapit originally wrote why we need a gendered name prefix at all is not clear to me or gendered pronouns at all and went on to the next para then as an afterthought i inserted the japanese seem to manage fine with san for everyone  that should have been at the end of the paragraph apologies
httpenwikipediaorgwikimuphrys_law
yeah but chan and so on are used to specify particular kinds or relationships like pals or pets or whatever my point was about san applying equally to men and women as the norm the rest of my post wasnt about japanese specifically
it seems to me that the article is missing the point the suggested changes relate to gender neutral use of language following on from the eu recommendation of making women more visible in written language not changing the language or grammar to incorporate new articles a recent questionnaire asking young people to name a number of sänger produced male results asking about sängerinnen und sänger gave beyoncé et al a look in it basically comes down to if you wouldnt say it dont write it if you write liebe freunde youre only addressing the males and dont get me started on freundinnen
pretty logical nonder haifischm der he hat zähne teeth plund die them pl trägt er he im gesichtund macheathm der he hat ein messerndoch das messern sieht man nicht
english language speakers have their idiosyncrasies too british english does funny things with numbers the public are advised but to a foreigner the most strange aspect is the attempt to sexneutral language by changing the expression him or her into they or his or herself in themselves in singular phrases
maybe im a pedant but i like the precision of german english is becoming less precise with theirtheythem being substituted for he or she to the point where even maternity contracts are afraid to state she quite frankly rogers it is all most unsatisfactory
german is a beautiful language and i also spent my youth learning to speak it properly i agree with you so take note skullen that makes at least two of us 
haha deterrents for you regarding the serious learning of such languages you say fair enough stick to such excellent languages as japanese chinese finnish bengali thai korean plus any of the austronesian and turkic languages then however literally all other languages on earth have at least two genders and czech polish swahili and a few others even have more than three you may refuse to take such languages seriously but i think youre limiting yourself unnecessarily get over yourself thats just how the vast majority of languages work and think about it pointlessness combined with the irrational makes up a substantial part of any language including gasp english
thats because junge boy doesnt end chen or lein all diminutives are neuter like mädchen it is odd though isnt it that the word for boy looks like a feminine word ie ends with an e strange that such a wellstructured language in terms of its grammar and pronunciation would produce such bizarre irregularities good luck with the translations 
dfrau ond drmann if im not mistaken
fork knife and spoon die gabel das messer der löffel und der haifisch der hat zähneund die trägt er im gesichtund macheath der hat ein messerdoch das messer sieht man nicht and the shark it has teethand it shows them in its faceand macheath he has a knifebut the knife one sees not
ideally we need a gender neutral hehis shehers i agree that they and theirs is the obvious candidate but it doesnt work in all situations because they has plural connotationsand in those situations where the plural connotation is confusing it is obvious that it is being used as a device to conceal gender
 stepbakwriter your example is of websters spelling reforms but german and other languages for that matter have also had spelling reforms in themselves they are not necessarily revolutionary more like a bit of occasional tidying up
many german chicks dig brits who take the trouble to learn their language i know that
i think your german teacher was joking with you either that or he was stupid and i doubt that
when does mr oltermann get his own column his articles are always so entrancingly clueless
a language that uses six words to make sixteen declensions of the definite article and then does the same again for the indefinite is positively designed to make foreigners mess it up
yes as euclideansabotage points out i think most people who wish to remove gender from language would still rather have their gender outed then be referred to as it curiously even she is considered rudethe standard reply when referring to she is who is she the cats motherwhich is intended to suggest that one should refer to a woman by their name which i suppose is fine if you know their namebut even if you do refer to a woman by her name rather than she it is still a form of gender since presumably its fine to refer to a man as he i once made the mistake of referring to my partner as mon partner in french which provoked a humorous response from my french teacherat least my partner is suitably gender neutral in english
im half german and like you detest and have been ignoring the rechtschreibreform completely as it doesnt make sense to me either but i think youre misunderstanding the issue herethe neutral gender thing is to address the outmoded and genuinely unfair notion that a default person is male you still get remnants of the same thing in english where a random animal will often be referred to as he even though chances are  that it might be female or in the case of ants bees wasps etc the default would actually definitely be female noone is suggesting that the quality of being feminine or having the feminine form means it would be thought of as worthless what people are saying is why not remove gendered words where gender is irrelevant as in the example of studenten students default and male version and studentinnen lady students studierende studying people incorporates everyone in one simple word in a reality where half the population is female the constant distinction the german language makes between people and female people may seem subtle or even invisible to a male person but is unfair and frustrating for everyone else its essentially a constant signal that being female means youre a minority a sidekick only version b to the default male since language is the main tool we have to shape and express our thoughts and it therefore also influences our thought patterns i think its important to make it as fair as possible
yeah not year sigh serves me right for correcting someones spelling 
vergewaltigung bitte but year nouns ending in ung are feminine i cant think of any exceptions to that one
let the language evolve and change naturally there are cases in the past where a language needed to be standadised but here i see no conditions where any change is justified this is just angry feminists trying to change a language to suit their idealogical ends even if it costs the fluency and beauty of the tongue itself
hey it took us centuries to create a language that discourages the upper class twit of the year champions from learning it and now you dont appreciate that
many linguists question whether language can be changed through human will the americans did it in the th century when noah webster created a revolutionary version of english for a revolutionary country hence no us and other americanisms
theres no point to assigning arbitrary genders to every thing in the universe a pointless tradition is still pointless
i refuse to be mrs please address me as mistress
tolerance we have a term for people who point out the errors of others and that is grammar nazi its as old as the internet itself
with mann und frau the beginnings are too
what are they going to do with the diminutives like madchen and fräulein these are neutral and not feminine as are entchen and ganzchen interesting that the english use the other german diminutive ling for duckling and gosling
imported nouns are usually das
i quite agree im not a native german speaker but i studied it up to alevel if only someone would point out that the suffixes chen and lein which act as diminutives are neuter and therefore in line with the usual german practice of taking the gender of the noun from the suffix or last noun in portmanteau words any word containing these suffixes will be neuter oh i just have whats the problem
genau
there is considerable differences between people and things a ship is referred to she most languages have some kind of article le soleil la luna la tierra its called tradition
one suggestion is that angela merkel will eventually no longer be die bundeskanzlerin but a neutral das bundeskanzler unfortunately it is virtually impossible to explain to a native english speaker how totally and utterly ridiculous and stupid this would sound to a german language should be comfortable and fair said pusch at the moment german is a very comfortable language but a very unfair one this is a joke isnt it germans will certainly not speak a perverted version of their great language just because some megalomaniac gender equality freaks believe that das mädchen is offensive to women which is clearly not the case
and accusative
although it implies inanimacy and can therefore be considered offensive
yes as the entirely ineffective académie française would concur
die is correct because storm troopers is plural
sorry i should like to correct you too theres no ablative in german german has four cases der werfall nominativ der wenfall akkusativ der wemfall dativ der wesfall genitiv and for your information gender in grammar is not the same as sex mädchen is a das word because the ending chen is a diminutive and diminutives in german are neuter hence das mädchen its also why a bread roll is neuter a bread roll is a small bread hence brötchen
forcing the country to confront change it appears to me that the country has confronted change and decided that they dont want it hence the requirement for die pc storm troopers i used die because no doubt this is a feminist issue
in german a young lady has no sex i think that i can be of assistance with that
hi you said he is and she is for example have no neat gender neutral it is
most germans dont know the rules either and the rules are different for a schwabian and a bavarian maybe they just didnt like your try and stop us tshirt
thats the one thing that makes german easy inviolable rules no silent es no too to two no i before e except after c if its there pronounce the verdammt thing and dont stop until you run out of letters
der die or das silence it iss ve who ask ze qvestions
yeah chicks dig guys who speak german even germans dont believe that
nope but thats due to english being my native language and i was talking about learning another language such as german which i made very clear in my comment there is considerable differences between people and things one of which is that there are far fewer such instances with regard to people than everything in the universe
having witnessed germans standing at an empty rail crossing at am waiting for the gates to raise before walking across i tend to agree
whats all the commotion about neutrality i wonder who in their right mind will ever be neutral about anything without being completely ignorant and stop fucking around with my language please i still havent recovered from the rechtschreibreform which was supposed to make things easier but instead gave us hidious monsters like schifffahrt with three consonants fuckedup lower and uppercase words in which i still cant find any logic and seperated words which should belong together consequently i ignored it as long as i could being a journalist know im supposed to write correctly so i had to adopt it last year still hate it though and why does language need to be genderneutral i dont get it are we supposed to ignore genders as well i dont think im ready for that also theres no judgement in der die das he she it who would ever think throw das kind the child into the garbage its just a thing after all i would never think that my chest die brust is worthless just because its a she i could do without rashes der ausschlag on my sensible parts however no matter how manly its gender might be if i ever get beatenup by a woman i didnt carelessly smack the door in her face im outta here
i did not say the english language is not beautiful it is when used correctlythe article was about german though and it is beyond doubt that the english and german languages reflect two different cultures the world is enriched by this diversitywhat i meant to convey is that the appalling tolerance for poor and incorrect english amongst the native speakers should not be expected across the board it is up to native english speakers to be first defending the beauty of shakespeares and modern english
my german teacher always used to say that germans love their dogs more than their kids hence der hund and das kind
i think most people dont have a problem with words that relate to a person or animal who is sexually male or female it does seem odd to apply gender to objects such as a pen or chair
de gaulle made a rhetorical virtue of gender with his françaises français aidezmoi in that order
accidentally uparrowed you sorry going to the volksschule near salzburg we stopped having spelling lessons in rd or th grade no need to learn to spell german since the pronunciation clears the way weltanschauung easy welt anschau ung hard to go wrong weltuntergang weltuntergang easyweltzusammenbruch weltzusammenbruch easy and so on english a late derivative of the germanic language on the continent spelling never stops eg how to spell thorough by someone who is not unilingual each language defines in its own world you cannot compare or valuejudge a language when having your two feet in another i would not recommend this narrow approach
so you have problems remembering the word policewoman or headmaster
native german speakers would say that wouldnt they after all it is quite natural for them but it sure bugs the rest of us and puts us off speaking german which is a pity i love to sing german lieder and i sing it rather well but i am always criticised first for my german not being of a high enough standard and next for being a woman how dare an english woman sing german lieder so now i only sing it in english the germans and the french take their language too seriously on occasions and should learn to share it with the rest of us getting the gender incorrect is not the end of the world even when answering a simple question like where is the station a german will correct the gender of station first and then give you the direction as if the gender it mattered but it does to them
not really there are several parts in germany where it is called der butter
to be honest having a marker for a persons gender doesnt really bother me that much in many instances its actually makes the sentence more clear if you dont know the subjects gender to begin with the only exception i can think of is freundin which means both female friend and girlfriend and as far as im aware theres no way you can differentiate i agree however it can get annoying and cumbersome when talking about a mixedgender group for instance having to say schüler und schülerinnen instead of simply students
justice ministrys edict that state institutions must use genderneutral language is forcing the country to confront change doublespeak it is more like an attempt to dictate how people express themselves expect the usual passiveaggressive bullying to follow
what a truly fucked ip stupid commentary
pretendname i do remember the removal of gender from english being a feminist hobby horse for a number of years i think it got as far as the common acceptance of ms youve obviously missed the threads whenever an article used female actor rather than actress blood everywhere i can tell you ps they are often works
one of the most significant deterrents for me regarding the serious learning of such languages was this need to assign some sort of gender to everything the memorization of a new language is hard enough without having to remember also that some thing was considered by whomever to be feminine or masculine or neutral but it wasnt just the added work it was the fact that it was and still is completely pointlessness combined with the irrational thats just the way it is neither of which settles well with me in any situation
depends on where you from in germany so yes sometimes we dont even know ourselves 
what can one say in defence of the beauty of the english language shakespeare perhaps
its one of the reasons why english has prevailed when german and french havent masculine and feminine also how you can just put i you we etc in front of a verb in english without changing it
i tried to speak german in germany but virtually every time i opened my mouth i was corrected for using the wrong gender even down to the dative and ablative the native speakers showed no pleasure that i was trying to speak to them in their native tongue it was so depressing i gave up and spoke english everyone was happy as i speak it rather well english language is so forgiving as really anything goes and those with foreign tongues soon gain confidence as they are not corrected every time they open their mouths cutting out the gender cases would help german and french to become easier to use and more socially correct i did not like being a das madchen instead of a die i think i should have a couple of dots somewhere never mind ill soon be corrected
actually the majority of german nouns are masculine followed by feminine and finally neuter most imported nouns from foreign languages are normally accoreded masculine status unless they already have a gender in their language of origin but a language that needs  hefty volumes to explain all the exceptions and rules is in desperatae of a radcial makeover the most absurd example is the genders for fork knife and spoon die gabel das messer der löffel while joghurt can be masculine feminine or neuter what a truly fucked up stupid language
schade too bad one of the most fascinating aspects of the german language ist its precision in rendering ideas it is not just and integral part of the mindset but also the tool which enabled great philosophers and thinkers of the pastthis has to be given up to please sloppy people who cant be bothered to learn genders and declinations joining a worldwide race to the bottom for convenience or egality in which english native language speakers are masters judging by how many cant write their own language correctly in this world where ability attention to detail and critical thinking are hard to practice and inconvenient ignorance is powerpretty soon well replace all verbs with machen like us anglophone foreign students when we were at the basic levelsin the three school systems with different languages in which i studied the anglosaxon ones are the only ones where native speakers where definitely worseperforming than nonnative speakers note written by a foreigner who learned german as an adult and still sometimes struggles with the declinations of die der das
or finnish which has no separate he and she even
one just has to get ones head around a very simple fact grammatical gender is something completely different from natural gender just accept that the gender of a word is in many cases arbitrary or has its roots in an historical developement ofth language in other cases like the often cited mädchenthe german language has evolved over many centuries and will continue to do so the only thing it doesnt need is feminist busybodies messing around with it to suit their ideological agenda feminin forms can be formed for any word if needed dont let people destroy a beautiful and useful tool just because theyre incapable of understanding and using it
tricky to change a whole language much easier just to speak a language that has the job done english perhaps
but die butter is correct
yes thats what the author said
damn i was writing the same thing and posted it and you bet me to it 
thats what i thought this sounds like a terrible idea i mean everything will just sound plain wrong
please elucidate
this has to be quite a task in german or frenchbut its not as if english is entirely gender neutral is it he is and she is for example have no neat gender neutralthey is doesnt work really because they whilst being gender neutral implies pluralwe could just start using they is in a kind of ally g way and see how people go with it i do remember the removal of gender from english being a feminist hobby horse for a number of years i think it got as far as the common acceptance of msthough ms generally still implies woman who has an issue with miss or mrs or is divorced
permanent over sensitivity is not tolerance
exactly just like how freedom of religious expression means people should be able to put up a statue of the  commandments on public land but its entirely wrong to allow satanists to put up a statue of baphomet next to it oh wait you realise that the situations people are talking about are cases where right wing speakers have been invited by student societies at government funded institutions who have then been noplatformed by left wing rioters trying to burn the place down using threat of violence to silence their political opponents thats the context not whatever fantasy you think youre talking about

as someone whos had to deal with actual genuine problems arising from immigration at a local political level i have to say this argument is routinely trotted out by people who really just want permission to be more offensive sensationalist and baseless than theyre able to get away with if your concerns are genuine and the problems are real then it really isnt hard to construct an argument in a way that is neither racist nor xenophobic we had problems with nonenglish speakers taking all the doctors appointments because they needed a translator which meant englishspeakers could only get telephone consultations real problem not racist there were major issues stemming from the roma slovak cultural norm of routinely socialising in the street until the early hours creating friction with both white british and pakistani asian residents who kept more regular hours real problem not racist if youre being called racist and xenophobic its probably because you are being racist and xenophobic either sharpen up your argument and stick to the facts or give it up and admit the facts underlying your argument are sparse and questionable
it doesnt offend me i look at the people who are saying it

bleeding heart liberals went too far with group think and now whinging as it gets thrown back in their faces bore off
au contraire i heard them all then decided theyre ridiculous no you didnt people such as yourself who think they have intrinsically more intelligence than plebs very rarely listen to plebs it is not in your nature you might see their lips moving but are saying shit shit shit in your mind rather than actually listening and seeking to understand declaiming people for claiming to know better than others while presuming to have a virtually telepathic knowledge of someones mind extending far beyond presuming only to know what information they have but even saying that this is how they think thats pretty ironic
freedom comes at a price just as freedom of information act allows us to access past informations required to pass judgements on issues that are private offensive is to offend while equality seeks to protect the victim against offensive behavioura price to pay when offensive behaviours comes at a price
gear great
ever noticed how the liberalleft are very eager to confront farright outfits like britain first and the edl yet how often did you see liberallefties protesting when islamic extremists like anjem choudhury were prowling around
and he wasnt banned for being racist he was banned for inciting the coordinated harassment campaign against a black female actor in the ghostbusters movie that had upset him so much that was the excuse given but of course theres no evidence that this was the case he criticised her and they both went on to trade insults some of his followers joined in if this is incitement then youre essentially saying that nobody with a large twitter following can ever criticise anyone on that platform and of course the fact that she is black is entirely irrelevant and speaking of racism as a random example milo sent a tweet to a jewish journalist who had just announced the birth of his child congratulating him on his kid coming out halfblack in the world of altright slurs that means said journalist is a cuckservative who loves to see his wife having intercourse with an african american because he is not man enough himself a particularly unpleasant accusation from yiannopoulos however it does not amount to racism or antisemitism the fact that ben shapiro is jewish is entirely incidental considering yiannopoulos levelled the same unpleasant insults at other nonjewish people cuck seems to be his favourite insult your speaking of racism intro seems unproven by the evidence that follows the same journalist later said the racist and antisemitic abuse went down markedly once milo got banned for me thats worth it its certainly a good thing but all youre arguing is that being offensive is worthy of censorship im not sure that chilling effect on free speech is worth it and yes i am aware that twitter has every right to ban any user from its platform for any reason im talking about the moral principle of free speech
surely getting upset about a religion believes that comes comes under the heading of being offended by general views you know others hold even when theyre not actively expressing them
i dont think so but youre making it up so you tell us
i think theres an important distinction between public free speech and private free speech i think if were honest then theres things well say when in the company of just friends or family that we would never say in mixed company to me that makes the whole argument about causing offence a little bit hypocritical its okay to say things that would cause offence but not okay to say things that will cause offence
yes it is because free speech has consequences in society as well as online
good points
pc is very convenient for shutting down anyone the left doesnt agree with hands over ears hate speechracismmisogynydaily mail reader it is civil to be honest with each other when certain points need to be raised diplomatic is a neutral word in the english language not just a positive one
um no he became popular with white racists first and those people and people who thought him useful for other reasons kept pushing him forward you are mistaking a small part of a reaction for the actual event
ill ask you a third time because im genuinely intrrigued what makes some people think they are more superior to most could you please tell us what specifically made you come to the conclusion that you more intelligent and that your opinion is more worthy than many of those here on cif and most of the people in the uk my thought is that you have little man syndrome but maybe you really are better than most of us presumably such rarefied criteria as the way opinions correspond with or diverge from reality logical coherence nuance etc
so freedom is speech is also the unrestricted right to speak from any platform no matter who owns that platform to take the most recent and infocus example of my at berkeley my understanding is that the owners of the platform had invited the speaker and that the owners of the platform subsequently had to cancel the speaker due to violent demonstrations violent being the key word there perpetrated by those who were under no obligation to listen to the speaker against those who were equally under no obligation but had nonetheless chosen to listen to the speaker
hey shes entitled to her opinion i may disapprove of what she says but ill defend to the death etc we seem to be in danger of going round in circles the laws and technological controls we have to protect us are sufficient by all means take advantage of them whenever you need to theyre there to protect us all the gear thing about the controls the word lists especially is that they can be tailored to individual sensitivities without having a draconian impact on the rest of us if you feel like you need them take advantage of them this is my advice oh and lets all be kind to each other
have you calmed down yet its your hypocrisy i cant stand i dont care which names you laugh at
ok get your point but being socially able to prove your brilliance has historically been much more limely for men glass ceiling and all that patriarchal societies theres is a complex social understanding of brilliance too and what its more likely to be connected with

as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole uk being complicit in war crimes in yemen thing possibly because beyond a handful of boring articles written by owen jones about it its hard to identify what the supposed wrongdoing actually consists of
what does it mean to accept others which others why should what you describe be the first step identity politics goes hand in hand with those pushing pc and the creeping introduction of limitations on free speech universalism is a solution to nationalism along with the revitalisation of universal values but the postmodern beliefs and creed informing the pc brigade deny the possibility of broad categories of universal values leading to extreme individualism the contradiction of utopian ideas of sameness and the specialness of minority others whom they attempt to place into special protected categories to be defended from the awfulness of white male culture at the heart of all this is a major tension between premodern modern and postmodern identities unfortunately most of the uni students enraged by social injustice have little historical or philosophical awareness and almost no skills for critically thinking about the ideological and practical implications of the theories driving their causes
the immoral characteristic of hate speech is the way it denigrates people for belonging to a larger group which is not inherently defined by any negative qualities which can be generalised to every member of that group so categorise hate speech as slurs used against groups such as the usual laundry list of nword variants faggot etc and regulate those while there will be a certain level of subjective wiggle room on hate speech which is not using those slurs but is clearly nevertheless hate speech that can be decided by the courts and a jury and thus be democratically legitimate
they have to have something of substance to say something worthy to contribute to the debate no they dont actually
as a left wing person i believe that you should be judged on your genuine merit and character and that is what political correctness started off trying to achieve through language however it seems to be increasingly used for less laudable reasons for me it has been coopted by elites as a divide and rule tactic that has presided over increasing division it is also used to avoid actual issues and give us the appearance of progress without actually making any tangible improvements how is having more black oscar winners for example actually going to help the thousands of young out of work black men get jobs or prevent the black on black crime that blights that communityalthough i voted remain i am able to see a strong left wing reason for brexit in terms of an inexhaustible supply of cheap labour that potentially drives wages down by not addressing this issue head on and implying that all those who voted brexit did so through bigotry is another example of how this tactic has been used to demonise those who disagree with the consensus
you dont think wealth is the bigger marker of privilege in western society thats what all the equal opportunity rhetoric boils down to even if it doesnt start from that point rich white women are more privileged than poor white men for example the only viable argument to my mind about genderracial privilege happens within class groups but i would argue that even where disparities remain they probably arent as pronounced as the differences of privilege experienced between class groups
maybe but certainly some more than others
yes im sure they really think that ruth not exaggerating at all there are we but as a guardian reader it is your privilege to turn micro into macro and be as offended as you damn well please and its all their fault dont you change a bit
i would try to avoid lying to my daughter

i think businesses should be free to serve whoever they want or dont want youre referring to a bad law that i dont support
i agree with most of your post but this bit this is basically about whether people should have the freedom to hate and to express that hatred is wrong as hate is projected onto a very wide range of utterences including mere statement of fact or expression of fear or concern how were those who expressed concern about rotherham et al while it was ongoing treated
possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of the unfazedness of the ordinary person unfortunately extends to many issues you care about i bet you wouldnt be too happy to see a fellow writer dismiss them on those grounds
it wasnt my example someone used it earlier in the thread which i followed up on still i think it conveyed the point well enough
once again thank you for this i thinking this may be an object lesson in how fake news gets distributed your original comment falsely suggesting the book burning incident now has in excess of  recommends
new labour are no different either shutting down the marxists but the left and their splinter groups eh
freedom of speech isnt an absolute right though the universal declaration of human rights states that restrictions are possible there are lots of restrictions on free speech that we all accept every day libel laws ndas the official secrets act etc
i dont think calling for deployment of your nations own armed forces is ever going to constitute incitement to violence not to anyone sane at least
even if your argument were not utter bollocks it still does not preclude women being brilliant httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisex_differences_in_intelligence the average iq scores between men and women have little variation however the variability of male scores is greater than that of females resulting in more males than females in the top and bottom of the iq distribution of course this doesnt preclude women from bring brilliant but it makes it less likely
my first class degree in history specialising in propaganda in britain and nazi germany not good enough then there is no resemblance between pc and totalitarianism democracies are founded on propaganda it runs through their fabric because you have to persuade people totalitarian regimes are founded on terror
i dont know why youre putting inverted commas around the words offended and hurt because they are totally subjective some people are offended by my existencei am a porkeating beerswilling infidel i already said that there are laws about libel slander and threateningabuse aka hate crimes and if you dont accept that emotionalmental pain is as significant and real as physical pain then i pity you it may be significant to the person feeling the pain but their feelings are legally irrelevant otherwise i will start protesting that my feelings are upset and that i suffer emotionalmental pain as a result of people making comments with which i disagree
the abusive language is on all sides all sides are now moving into violence your condemnation has to be applied equally for it to be of any merit and even if you did apply it equally id still say that abusive language isnt worth worrying overly about its not like none of us have ever been insulted before obviously if its sustained and coordinated thats different but again all sides do this that said i was mostly just pointing out that your comment was a little over the top
cake shop sued for prejudice and discrimination on bi sexual celebrations why can you be sued for prejudice and discrimination when freedom to offend is acceptable and free
nothing you could type could possibly offend me facetoface situations are different where theres a possibility of it leading to imminent physical harm but words on a screen from a stranger type away dont get too redfaced about it
and since youre the legal expert youll know that the case was overruled
thats america they do all sorts of weird things
as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by many things many of them dont even vote this is hardly a convincing reason that something isnt an issue
the thing is daniel youve now undermined your own argument by saying there should be some limits on free speech ie people shouldnt be allowed to encourage their audience to visit physical harm on others its very naive and simplistic to claim that no speech should be censored we can discuss whether or not current pc mores are desirable or effective but the idea that literally anything is fair game simply doesnt survive first contact with the real world at what point would we want to curtail hitlers right to free speech were he or someone like him to try the same things again also the definition of what really constitutes free speech needs to be broadcast more loudly it really means that the government wont prosecute you yet altright whiners routinely claim milos free speech is suppressed when people exercise their own right to free speech in their angry responses to his provocation or when he loses a book deal because hes too controversial for his publisher
freedom includes the freedom to offend else its not really freedom
the left is much quicker to fight the center than the right at the dnc convention i went there i live in philly as a basically a trump supporter many sanders people told me that trump supporters were much more rationale than the cljnton supporters
 theres a debate to be had about how we define free speech but as long as katie hopkins is still getting published in a hugely popular paper its largely academic so perhaps it should be renamed not really free speech or mostly free speech or freeish speech or speech that i agree with and has been passed as acceptable by a committee of kings place intellectuals 
this overlooks why increasingly there are such extreme words being spoken in turn causing offence in large part because the thought police have tried to demonise so many ideas thoughts sayings that people have naturally been pushed to expressing these more forcefully invoking mill the key question is not about offence vs harm its harm vs harm in the long run is society more damaged by these microaggressions or by going down a road where people are gagged selfcensoring and compliant with the norms of the selfappointed guardians of language and thought at which point progress would halt because eventually it would be impossible to even conceive of new ideas
ive increasingly come to believe that the way forward is that rather than try and forge political correctness into some kind of shield we should instead fight fire with fire  hahaha you have rewritten history you folks started the fire and now we are fighting your fire with ours hence brexit hence trump they are a reaction to decades of abuse and sociopathic lack of empathy from your side of the fence neither would have happened if you were even half as intelligent and rational as you all claim to be borders would not be going up all over europe there would be far less hostility to immigration and refugess there would be no le pens etc if only you had looked outside your own limited tunnel of what makes things work and what things are doomed to failure your failure rate at this point is ample evidence that you folks are not a fraction as bright as you think you are
that link to the wire isnt usable so i cant comment on whether its racist or not the reason i cant use it is it just brings loads of pictures of women in bikinis showing their tits for clicks very progressive
political correctness would be a wonderful thing if we could only get everybody to agree what is politically correct
you could argue that fire in a crowded theatre would be a breach of the peace
absolute nonsense joe you have decided what you think she is talking about and have projected that onto the article regardless of intent stop looking at people as part of one team or the other and stop buying the crap youre being fed if virtuesignalling isnt a catchphrase then i dont know what is
why do women lack confidence if you are talking about a group and not an individual its not valid to refer to individual upbringing
because iq tests are based on more male forms of intelligence that would result in the average man scoring higher in iq tests but they dont men and women score equally on average but the variance is higher for men
most of the protesters were nonviolent and were exercising their constitutional right legitimately to silence someone who has an opinion they may not like they may not have been using violence but their goal was in principle equally as nefarious
but the author didnt suggest more laws did she shes discussing the damage that might be done by the build up of increasing little bits of offence and the difficulty of understandinf offence as different to harm
im listening
um berkeley hello
yes the article is run through with assumptions about who is doing what this is one of the primary mistakes far left uni students are making
how about the fact that pc is a waste of time and counterproductive policing the word choices of people is not going to affect any deep change in them whilst papering over the cracks in society so no one really gets down to the nitty gritty with each other weve had years of this nonsense yet here we are people are still tribal and favour those in their own group over those from other groups lefties and righties people of whatever colour or creed we are all alike in that pc is not going to change that part of our dna time to face it pc is a load of crap the left needs to stop acting like a prudish mother language timothy
the opposite of poitical correctnes is downright rudeness do you really want to live in a country where people lack politeness not long ago it was impolite to use the word pregnant in public never mind such ghastly improprieties as mentioning homosexuality or abortion
agree what is the authors point just more click bait i guess
and it also the whole focus on sexualitygenderrace as the key issue of the left sets up some of socities most advantaged people as victims when class is by some distance the biggest issue this is a big part of it people have the idea that an impoverished white man is more privileged than a rich black woman and therefore if he disagrees with her hes a bully whos punching down
maryam namazie iranian exmuslim secularist and true feminist
its perfectly possible to believe people should have the right to say horrible things while questioning their decisions to do so but thats not what is happening people have been hounded out of jobs tim hunt and students unions have noplatformed several speakers if you cant have a free exchange of ideas at universities then where can you have it just because you have a right to behave badly does that mean you actually should it depends what you class as behaving badly some of the greatest scientific developments have been a result of people considered to be behaving badly usually by a religious authority at the time
political correctness and diversity are sticks which are used to beat the white heterosexual male
with any freedom there comes a responsibility and consequences if people arent prepared to accept the consequences then they can normally expect to have their freedom revoked
maybe but when the left defends islamwhose creed contains many beliefs it is supposedly against it makes itself look ridiculous
the irony is that these bastions of free speech such as the dm site are heavily modded and opposing views rarely get published in their comments section
for evil to prosper it is only necessary that good men do nothing for evil to prosper it is only necessary that good men worry about causing offence
ive never met any of those people and it wasnt referring to this subject but to those who people who despise political correctness usually want to rail against race relations gay rights gender equality etc allow me to introduce myself im in favour of lgbt rights gender equality and racial equality and never have had to learn these things i was brought up that way yet i hate political correctness because the bit you dont appear to have grasped is that political correctness does not mean correctness ie it is possible to be correct yet politically incorrect i despise this concept because its analogous with the idea that something correct cannot or should not be stated if it upsets someone loses someone votes or fails to make everybody drop into a circle crosslegged singing kumbayah its in direct opposition to not only being able to say things which are true but also actively discourages the search for truth anyone who cares one little bit about the truth however nasty that may be for someone should be against it
he used to work in the queen adelaide in shepherds bush he cut across all race creed and sexuality borders everyone hated him
nobodies was stopped from be able to speak everybody is free unless of cause your muslim as the right actually did bring in laws to stop them to publish whatever they what for near zero cost in the modern world did you miss the whole charlie hebdo thing the cost to them was far from zero plenty of people appear to think arseholish behaviour is ok if directed at certain groups usually those which identity politics adherents think are unimportant or even deserving of it due to their ethnicity gender sexuality or religion
words can not do harm its physically impossible the harm is all in your mind offence is always taken never given  this is amongst the stupidest things i have ever read im sure that wont offend you since you believe that to be impossible
wrong target then the liberal left are not all journalists they are more likey to work in the public sector be educators social workers researchers and so on they believe in a welfare state and redistribution they may be despised by some sections of those who are poorer and not professional because of their greater earnings more fulfilling work and the white coat effect but the teal enemy to then are the conservative right who believe solely in the free market and trickle down from wealth at the top and see redistribution and economic management as some kind of social engineering
what world shape debate what debate do you think there is to be had bad example should have picked something else to make your actually very valid principle
now you know how remain voters feel when so many brexiters hurl abuse at them apparently your more vocal fellow voters think that i should be raped then shot as a traitor for voting remain
radical leftwing political theory heralded by anarchism is the definition of antiauthoritarianism political thought is far too complex for a single leftright axis the political compass still falls short of the complexity required but its adequate here the xaxis is the traditional leftright economic variable or perhaps even more broadly collectivist individualist the vertical yaxis is authoritarian libertarian the blanket radical leftwing political theory you describe would sit somewhere close to the bottom left leftwing libertarian corner i imagine its not that different in practice to the bottom right rightwing libertarian corner they both presuppose the willingness to and necessity of donating your resources to others whether they technically belong to the society or the individual is essentially academic i suppose rightwing libertarianism values the small society in its own right whereas leftwing libertarianism merely necessitates it of course mao would be in your upper left corner leftwing authoritarianism excluding figures such as him from leftwing political theory seems selfserving at best top right corner maybe pinochet hitler for me would be closer to the centre on the horizontal axis obviously his ethnonationalist social policies were far right but his economic policy admittedly forced by the war effort certainly wasnt maybe the political compass needs a third d axis to differentiate between economic and social policy
but if people have the right to be offensive then those they are targeting have the right to be offended surely you cant espouse such a freedom when it only works one wayand as for apportioning fault i would suppose that those offending someone are also apportioning fault to the personpeople being targeted one could in fact argue that we need thicker skins when dealing with migrants instead of feeling that our identity has been compromised by their presenceas always this works both ways
actually the left are total hypocrites after years of saying evil tories to ordinary voters who happened to tick the blue box calling anyone who opposed uncontrolled immigration a racist and generally dripping with doasisaynotasido condescension voters have noticed they noticed that the guardians editorial staff is dominated by public school and grammar school kids from privileged backgrounds they noticed that labour mps fiddled their expenses too just for big colour tvs instead of duckhouses they noticed the likes of diane abbot and shami chakrabarti joined the social order they pretend to oppose as they sent their kids to public school they say inherited political power in the benn family they noticed that labour leaders will lie to take us into illegal wars resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands bloody murder in the name of good they noticed that the left dont actually hold the moral high ground they just value signal it and here you go again providing more proof as if any were needed that empty vessels make the most noise
you were ing individual cases to argue against statistics everybody knows there have been brilliant women
also people tend to respond with facts like the gender gap actually being a parental gap or that most young black men die at the hands or guns of other young black men or that more men kill themselves than women or that asian indian or chinese people do better than their white peers and so on what a perfect example of the twitterification of political discourse facts without context are meaningless hurling them around as a gotcha is pretty much the opposite of civilized discourse i mean what the hell are you trying to disprove with them that since most black men are killed by other black men something thats true for every ethnicity btw we can safely discount the number of african americans killed by policemen as negligible far more people die in car accidents every year than because of terrorist attacks so why care about terrorism right and what are those suicide rates supposed to demonstrate that women arent oppressed after all or that mens penchant for violence doesnt even spare themselves when you point out that the gender gap is actually a parental gap youre trying to make the case that more men should share the burden of parenting right and youre not trying to say that blacks are more stupid than indian or chinese people after all you wouldnt ever by so mealymouthed about your beliefs would you youre just stating that four hundred years of domestic oppression does indeed still leave its mark on society i assume so why not spell it out instead being deliberately obscure
i am afraid that you are very very wrong in a number of your claims in this article the first and most problematic considering the widening ideological gap between far left and far right is your assertion that the backlash against pc fanaticism is only to be seen in the writings of rightwing columnists or young internet trolls how far from the truth you are i am a leftwing guardian buying liberal and all of my likeminded friends colleagues and acquaintances consider trigger warnings microaggressions and the banning of speakers on campuses to be utter madness i am  so it may be a generational thing in part that said young liberals in italy where im based cannot believe such inane ideas have taken root in the uk either they are shocked and appalled that free speech would be under such strain as for your reference to studies well microaggressions is a extremely dubious phenomenon and the man that invented the term said they have been mistakenly used i believe they have also been disproved by further research and even if they were real the way to deal with dysfunctional social dynamics on campuses is via discourse education and the learning of critical thinking and debating skills not blanket bans bullying and recreational outrage at minor issues
obviously we should try to be pleasant to people but historic oppression simply is not the determining factor in most peoples lives in britain in  but the hierarchy of victimhood is the central credo of this political movement which is simply an evolution of marxism with race gender and sexuality substituted for class the problem is that its advocates have never openly made the public case for making group identity and cultural marxism core principles of our liberal democracy instead they employ shame and silencing to try to achieve its ends it really is time for an open debate in the west on this issue should race and gender identity be our primary political identity and is it the role of society and the state to rebalance the scales of those group identities
violence by women causes less harm due to obvious differences in size and strength but it is by no means harmless women may use weapons from knives to household objectsincluding highly dangerous ones such as boiling waterto neutralize their disadvantage and men may be held back by cultural prohibitions on using force toward a woman even in selfdefense in his  review straus concludes that in various studies men account for  to  of those injured in heterosexual couple violence men also make up about  of intimate homicide victimsnot counting cases in which women kill in selfdefense and women are at least as likely as men to kill their childrenmore so if one counts killings of newbornsand account for more than half of child maltreatment perpetratorscathy young time magazine

thanks on the upside probably a few people including me will read the book as a result of all this publicity
no the process of perjoration illustrated with  examples because this is an article not a book shows that english reflects the attitudes of its users especially those who determine usage that these attitudes include sexism is no surprise

apparently katherine connor martin head of content creation at oxford dictionaries has said rabid feminist was a poorly chosen example in that the controversial and impolitic nature of the example distracted from the dictionarys aim of describing and clarifying meaning a more generic example like rabid extremist or rabid fan would also have been supported by evidence on our corpora and would have illustrated the meaning of the word without those negative impacts the only people who say rabid feminist these days are rabid antifeminists its not worth worrying about and ann oakleys book where the offending e came from knocks the twitterati into a cocked hat

often these negative jokes have some basis in reality my motherinlaw always treated me with polite contempt until her husband became senile and undependable after she discovered needs and uses for me she learned to love me and treated me like a son mils are just people feminism is just an indication of advancement in civilization women no longer need men for protection and support as they have in more primitive societies on the other hand men no longer have such a strong interest in women for breeding are we headed for a war of the sexes

sure thing when it comes to women the message is a depressing one the denigration of half of the population has embedded itself in the language in ways you may not even be aware of here i see that the message is a depressing one it is not was and unless these women are supposed to be outraged by what people used to say before they were born i would think it is still used today also you may be aware of the denigration if youre still using the language that denigrates willingly and knowingly hope that clarifies my stance

the female eunuch was published in  the descent of woman in  so you were reading these before i was born ha ha i dont think so how old do you think i am i merely asked you to warn me if you were linking to the daily mail sorry you misunderstood i dont swallow everything in the guardian and maybe the mail does contain some truth i just prefer not to patronise a website that includes videos of animal cruelty and has comments that are the verbal equivalent of sexual assault under photos of a year old woman in a bikini sorry that shit turns my stomach this woman connie st louis could very well be a liar and a con there are an awful lot of them about if she is that poses some very serious questions why did ucl rush to ditch tim hunt on the say so of a liar why did they not ask him for his side of the story did they try and find any evidence of what he said which you say is available and allegedly proves she was lying would they not have allowed him to make an apology stand by him and carry on as before why did they not follow the correct procedure and a more general point why do the media print any old tripe whether its true or not anything said on twitter seems fair game to make it into print why is that why do the dickheads on twitter get a disproportionate amount of press coverage what does it tell us about the press i didnt see that article in the guardian by st louis in fact until your link i had no idea who originated the complaints about tim hunt im not even sure when i first came across the story the first article i read was the one by tim and his wife it was a wee while later that i noticed this event cropping up on the list of bad things that feminists do that was when i looked into it and you think i approve of the guardian youve simply not been reading my comments
same might be said about motherinlaw so often connected with negative jokes and the narrow leafed and sharppointed plant called motherinlaws tongue
tends to be the way on here pick a fight rather than seek to develop understanding insight or even change ones own view
ive looked through the comments and so many men denying the writers premise so vigorously says hes on to something but i knew that im a woman and live with this everyday institutionalized sexism all around but as jimmy carter says men dont care
languages evolve do they thanks for that
arent they those toast thingies dipped into boiled eggs lol
or even eliminating language altogether colonist style
bet you know the meaning of pedant thoughlol
bollocks
and you sound like another passive agressive victim
not in australiagday you old bastard is a term of endearment
obviously you have no idea what womens lives are likeits very easy to pontificate from your safe white male privelege on how theres no problem but go ask your high school daughter about sexist words that hurt about double standards about aquaintence rape sexism rages through this culture men who deny it are the same reason cops shoot unarmed black men sexism is of a piece with racism to run a slave society white men had to put the boot on everybodys throat including women well time to take the boot away and learn to be a human not a member of a boys only clubhouse i know growing up is painful but better late than never
oh please written like the most sexist guy of all a new idea isnt actually going to kill you in fact the big crack it makes in your ossified mind would probably do you good
oooh even harsher mansplaing
what i meant is calling every female a bitch or whore is sexist calling ones girlfriend ones bitch is also sexist
heres a word mansplaining youre mansplaining something you either cant understand or it makes you uncomfortable so you generate a lot of words from your patriarchal soapbox tedious trait dude
has always been a pejorative even as a simple descriptor its loaded by social status issues and pecking order placement its power as a nasty name comes from inferences about social rank not gender and it barely compares to bitch in its general nastiness levels
the alternative word is pimp and it doesnt matter how the word got there but that it went from a term of respect to one of sexual servicer
let her carry on considering she has made comments like men will always be jealous otherwise they wouldnt be menoh wouldnt that be wonderful you can be sure youre dealing with  guaranteed misandrist and its comments like that which have finally led to men and women waking up to the toxicity and irrationality of feminism
thats pretty much what i said in my second post but youre nit picking nobs call their governess nanny
indeednature wired us differently to all mammals because it knew there will be a herd of guardian readers to satisfy i said have known
the problem with a no true scotsman position is all the scotsmen
i thought this was an interesting topic to discuss but youve made it clear from your comment that youre not interested in doing that and therefore im not interested in talking to you
the distinction you make isnt always clearcut for a dictionary to repeat a sexist reality is also to reinforce it recording facts as opposed to ignoring them in official records are value judgements to the extent that the oed is considered an authoritative reference
strange i thought i was characterizing some of the techniques of one group of commenters largely because yelling this doesnt matter seems like a poor way to prove the unimportance of anything youre the one saying there are only two sides here
congratulations youve effectively narrowed the comments sections into people who are opposed to the article or in favor of it very astute
well why dont you do that if you think thats the most important action to take and leave the rest of us to enjoy our discussion about language as a general remark not addressed at miasma id love somebody to analyse the over  comments on this article to see how many of them do the standard deflection moves for an article about sexism a this isnt real b this isnt a problem c the real problem is over there especially in another country and d this article does not align with my personal experience seriously who thinks their own experience is universal a whole bunch of people loudly saying pay no attention to that man behind the curtain really isnt going to make interested people look away
how many feminists do you think that covers pretty much every single one who writes for the guardian i cant be arsed checking but id be surprised if there was one among them who didnt join the feeding frenzy and they played the primary role in turning this complete nonstory into an international outragefest for feminists everywhere why did they not reinstate him if this woman was a liar an excellent and penetrating question perhaps they could resurrect david kelly while theyre at it how could connie st louis have predicted the shitstorm that was about to be unleashed how indeed as she busied herself writing this piece for the guardian fifteen days after the story broke ordering the planet to stop defending tim hunt warning as per your orders that is a link to the original version not the heavily edited one that now appears on the cif website oh and probably better if you dont read the comments and please if youre going to link to the daily mail put a warning on it that is the most odious piece of shit in journalism you know the problem with people like you its not your intellectual snobbery thats a minor irritant its your complete and utter intellectual and moral dishonesty you would rather read lies in a paper you approve of than the truth in a paper you dislike but hey thats a good thing because it means you will never have to ask yourself why ms st louis no longer claims in her online cvs that she has written for the mail the times or the independent or that she presents and produces a range of programmes for bbc radio  and bbc world service or that she is a regular contributor to a tv programme that went off air six years ago or that she has an honours degree in biology or that she sits on the audit committee of uk sport or that she is a member of the royal institution etc etc tim hunt was extremely misguided and out of touch if he thought that posing as a male chauvinist pig was going to go down well when it was translated americans dont get the british sense of humour so no wonder it went down like a lead balloon in korea and many other countries and this is where your intellectual snobbery and dishonesty lead you the st louis account of this event has belatedly been repudiated by a large number of people who were actually present but who werent given the privilege of an international guardian magaphone to trumpet their versions and it has been refuted by a video of hunts speech but up there on the heights of mount moral superiority youre not ever going to be troubled by that kind of information and youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem sunshine i was reading and writing about the female eunuch and the descent of woman before you were even born elaine morgan is still one of the most thoughtprovoking authors ive ever read in my life easily in my top halfdozen i was a feminist then and im a feminist now but i would ream myself a new arsehole if the one i have now ever started producing the kind of stuff that masquerades as feminism in this newspaper above and below the line
i agree with you the problem with treating sexism as a theoretical ore to be prospected and mined from the cultural output of a society is that you will always be able to identify it because you will be looking at everything through that prism there is no benefit to this and it becomes entirely about treating the symptoms not the causes it would be better for everyone if this energy were focused on eliminating functional sexism
no that was actually the articles point language as the medium through which we conduct almost all relationships public and private bears the precise imprint of our cultural attitudes the history of language then is like a fossil record of how those attitudes have evolved or how stubbornly they have stayed the same sexist assumptions find their way into speech and writing for the simple reason that society is still sexist
the writer seems to have missed the point that dictionaries are descriptive of language not prescriptive they are simply a record of how words are being used in reality not a value judgment of how they should be used
yes you might call it cherry picking except that would probably be seen as referring to sexploitation of inexperienced young women
people getting very worked up on social media whod a thunk it im not defining feminism i gave ann oakleys definition of what it means to her shes enough of a feminist for the oxford lot to think it was safe to put her e online either that or theyre up to mischief my point is this is michael obanreagan primarily concerned with the oppression of women and combating this i think the answer is no as an anthropologist he can be picking and choosing the object of his attentions he is an outside observer an academic he studies human society yes that may involve gender studies but that does not make him a feminist if all you have to do to be a feminist is announce that you are a feminist or think you are then the word has no meaning and we are back to emer otooles article the word as currently flung about in the media seems to have no meaning merely getting worked up on social media does not make you a feminist of course some feminists can be tits and some antifeminists can be arseholes
ive tried to do that elsewhere she is just talking about her school it was a girls school and all the teachers were women the sentence is just a throwaway remark its her autobiography and the whole book is about her experiences leading up to her becoming a feminist so she just mentioned it at that point i suppose shes saying that she didnt get the feminism from her teachers but she says elsewhere that the allfemale environment and the fact she had no brothers may have contributed somewhat to her feelings as an outsider she says history was all about men but in an allfemale environment it didnt occur to her to ask where are the women its interesting and she has a great command of the english language its therefore such a shame that this man has come along and made a big fuss about the dictionary entry and people are now attacking feminism there is an interesting discussion to be had about language and gender but starting off with a tweet is not the way to go about it
well ive just managed to read emer otooles article cant see an awful lot wrong with it what were the comments saying i did click on the link to the tweets god what a waste of time its like the comments on the daily mail or sometimes on you tube so much hate if that guy wanted a serious discussion why oh why did he put it on twitter
try copying and pasting the links works then there are a lot of people most of them women although its the men who seem to be most sanctimonious about it all getting very worked up on social media etc please stop saying it isnt happening because it is you may not think its feminism but they seem to think it is a lot of people seem to disagree and think it has a lot to do with feminism youre not actually the arbiter of what is and isnt feminism personally i think its got more to do with self interested attention seekers attempting to have their worldview reflected and you see people doing it all the time these days with the advent of identity politics and its not exclusive to feminism but some feminists are doing it here i dont even know what your view is though you just seem intent on saying such and such isnt a feminist based on your unknown yet to be mentioned criteria like it or not feminism can be brought into disrepute and in this instance rightly so its not a divine form ideology beyond criticism just because someone who is a feminist is making a tit of themselves doesnt mean theyre no longer a feminist as you seem determined to suggest
another example muliebrity which the oed defines as the characteristics or qualities of a woman womanhood womanliness opposed to virility also softness effeminacy compare this to websters revised unabridged dictionary  the state of being a woman or of possessing full womanly powers womanhood correlate of virility the oed defines it in terms of weakness softness and a lack of manly strength virility while websters recognizes womanly strength as a power in its own right and a correlative of manly power wake up oed
it reminds me of how those whose favourite term of abuse is dick will often slump to the fainting couch upon hearing any utterance of the feminine counterpart more often across the pond to be fair
linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men the link only goes to some examples of the process are there any actual rigorous statistics even if there is a trend in that direction it could easily be because people tend to use polite euphemisms to criticise women while using more direct descriptions to criticise men which might be described as sexist in the sense of different behaviour towards the sexes but hardly in the sense of treating women worse
i finally managed to see the actual entry in the dictionary its no  in a chronological list i have no problems with it sick and tired of twitter outraged pillocks like this guy clinging to the coattails of feminism and bringing it into disrepute see my standalone comment here httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejaneightwordssexismheartenglishlanguagecomment i see there is some other outrage in the last few days that may have involved something similar thankfully that has passed me by this has nothing to do with feminism see here for a definition of feminism by ann oakley herself httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejaneightwordssexismheartenglishlanguagecomment michael obanreagan is not a feminist
the first article is by emer otoole and has been panned in comments here apparently theyve disabled the comments sounds like a load of pants glad i didnt see it nor waste my time commenting on it how dare they do that to peoples comments the second link is to a straightforward article describing the canadian anthropologist michael obanreagan and his pathetic tweet that started this shitstorm still cant see any women mentioned although there will probably be a mixture of females and males in any stupid nonsense wont there i never said it was a male conspiracy my problem is that feminism is being brought into disrepute who gave michael obanreagan feminist credentials anyway see my comment here httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejaneightwordssexismheartenglishlanguagecomment your other two links dont work for me just sick and tired of people putting up a straw man of what feminism is and then tearing it down
what is a feminist ann oakley asked this question in taking it like a woman when i say im a feminist what do i mean i mean that i believe that women are an oppressed social group a group of people sharing a common exclusion from full participation in certain key social institutions and being overrepresented in others women in britain in the s are still subject to the awful souldestroying tyranny of being told the meaning of their lives by others in terms which are not theirs feminism means being more involved on a political level with the situation of women than with that of any other minority or majority group by that definition i doubt very much that michael obanregan is a feminist he is an anthropologist whatever he has to say has very little to do with feminism just because there may be some women as well as men jumping on his bandwagon does not change that fact
ok cheers that was quite interesting would have been even more if youd summarised the specific context of the ed sentence in the book even if it wasnt particularly illuminating but still good to have some real information thanks
shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens i suppose i dont want to hear a shrill mans voice its would probably be like nails on a blackboard
does anyone truly understand anyone else
try faggot dick gay these were not insults to begin with they became one
churl knave varlet perjoration isnt just for women
dear david what do you think of the words dick faggot gay and others like them dont you rather think they somewhat negate your whole argument who are those most linguists by the way the word madam httpsenwikipediaorgwikimadam most people  id say use it in the polite sense and ive only ever called my cake tart i dont think this word is still in use neither is wench ive only seen it in game of thrones lately similarly the other examples youve brought up they are all words that are used in historical fiction mostly however dick faggot and the rest dont you think youd have a better case to argue how sexist the english language is against males not a serious question dont worry the points ive raised are serious though
whats that censor bait so you can whine about it afterwards feeble stuff never go over the heads of your audience
oh and just a couple of counterexamples dick meaning man originally faggot gay there is a long list of malespecific insults that meant something else previously so please do kindly move along yourself
she wasnt married to george antheil she wanted to thwart her husband and defeat german attacks your post is misguided and rambling fool on aug   united states patent no  was granted to them for their design but persuading the navy to take it seriously proved insurmountable pentagon bureaucracy coupled with the fact that the designs coinventor was a movie star resulted in their idea being ignored hedys folly may have been in assuming men in government might overcome their prejudice that a beautiful woman could not have brains and imagination
huh
 to refer to women as inferior to men no not really these are just derogatory they do not show any context in relation to men they just degrade the person they are used on you are essentially arguing that calling a woman a bad name implies that you think that woman is inferior compared to men while calling a man a bad name will not carry any such implications calling a woman a tart i dont know who would do it but lets say you do for the sake of this conversation only implies that woman has worse morals than other women
my original comment was a sarcastic one i guess that was really difficult to detect you want an actual argument fine most linguists believe that pejoration happens more frequently to words that refer to women than those that refer to men  who are these linguists where is his proof aside from his desire to appeal as an ultimate authority i would love to see these linguists perhaps an academic paper or review would do his whole premise is flawed from here on he argues for a conclusion he already settled and picks and chooses his arguments for it ignoring anything that goes against it he brings up a couple of examples ignoring the present day use and drawing overarching conclusions ive never heard anyone using mistress for example except in pirates of the caribbean madam is still used as a female version of sir and so on and so forth tart ive only seen used in conjunction with cakes i guess food channel is sexist too come to think of it tart is a derogatory form for women cakes are usually prepared by women so there must be some connection there interestingly enough the author kind of forgets that there are similar words which became derogatory for men but i guess thats just as unimportant as anything that goes against his agenda just as we see in  of the guardian feminist articles pointing it out is not the defense of the threatened patriarchy which does not exist by the way reading about it it looks like a splendid idea its just the recurring issues with political agendas the breaks in logic and the constantly defiled basics of critical thinking are getting really annoying these by the way are all things that should be cherished by liberals everywhere joke if you did not get it
i have never thought of wench as what was listed here i think of a wench a pooreconomically mainly girl who is in trouble
how are you suppressed on a daytoday basis whowhat is preventing you from doing what you want
i literally think i have been called all of those things in jest no one uses those words without making reference to a pirate film or some eastlondon gangster flick in the case of tart
how have a cherry picked comments i have not provided a single e secondly extremists dont talk for an entire movement however the moderate certainly do nothing to distant themselves from the extremists
pistachio eater
were they unbelievers in the sense they use the term
here are a couple of articles both by women you obviously missed httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejanrabidfeministlanguageoxfordenglishdictionary httpwwwtheguardiancombooksjanoxforddictionaryreviewsexistlanguagerabidfeministgender and these two citing lots of very upset womenhttpwwwbuzzfeedcomlaurasilvergooncallmearabidfeministbgrdgvbhttpsstorifycommay_gunoxford hope that clarifies that yes there are quite a few women involved in what you rightly describe as a farce and its not some male conspiracy
they may take a different view but you will always get unbelievers
these are all so obvious dig deeper for example vagina etymologically descends from sheath scabbard ie without function unless its being penetrated
quite though it turns out the dictionary is online and i was able to find quite a few gendered examples showing men in a poor light see the jessica valenti article yesterday
get a grip
im sorry that i was snippy in my response that was unnecessary but i do think the point im trying to make matters what the article shows along with masses of other evidence is that this kind of ingrained misogyny isnt in fact primitive or medieval its really quite modern this isnt to say that it was awesome to be female in the s thats another discussion and completely agree on the importance of discussing misogyny as it takes place and affects real lived lives though i agree with the op that language both reveals and reinforces that misogyny so i dont think the two are separate when we say that suchandsuch an attitude is outdated or medieval or whatever i think we distance ourselves from any responsibility or association with it that in turn allows groups like daesh to step in and claim theyre returning to some golden age of the past whereas the medieval islam they appeal to and that we conspire in allowing them to appeal to would mostly have been profoundly repulsed by what they think and do so my feeling is that we need to man up another sexist term in both directions and admit that genocide misogyny discrimination the wild abuse of ideologies for power tripsall these things are profoundly modern theyre part of our world just as theyre part of our language not something that happened in the past that weve all moved on from i might of course be making a massive mountain out of a molehill youre certainly entitled to think that and tell me so but he who controls the past and all that
well put suzi
the article doesnt imply otherwise
then let me know where he suggests that any kind of remedy is needed or that the problem is with the language rather than with society itself
its not a ridiculous article its interesting and thought provoking just because the issues raised in it dont affect you does not mean its worthless
whats that censor bait so you can whine about it afterwards feeble stuff
nope he explicitly acknowledges the nonprostitute usage the female equivalent of sir a woman of high rank is still used in formal contexts as a mode of address
well okay whats interesting depends on your mentality of course i think ive misunderstood i thought you were arguing that it was interesting that oed hadnt given any indication as to the authors point of view about rabid feminists rather than the e itself carrying such an indication some people are curious some are just looking for trouble now now
though i did have a read out of courtesy pretty simplistic ah just to clear up some confusion i now see youre probably referring to the inline link to a paragraph from trasks historical linguistics i was citing something else entirely httpsbooksgooglecoukbooksidsasdhgcamppgpaamplpgpaampdqexamplesofpejorationmalefemaleampsourceblampotsfcokxfozxampsiguiummqskgw_ytwarkecxluamphlenampsaxampvedahukewivsedgkahvmwbqkhqobjoqaeihzaavonepageampqampffalse i dont agree with everything in the ten pages there but simplistic it aint basically its a much more detailed review of the issue intended for a different audience than dss guardian article my objections to the lampctr article would among other things include homonym rather than homophone is possibly not the best choice of term when discussing the problematics of queenquean the author doesnt fully distinguish between standard english and slang uses of words the dictionary referencing is a bit cavalier unless you already know or check the bibliography at the end you wouldnt necessarily realise that farmer and henley dates from the end of the nineteenth century in fact the entire choice of dictionaries seems a little odd when it comes to slang no jon lighter or jonathan green but that may be a function of when the piece was written that said the author does bring together a fair mass of material relevant to the issue in question
thats my point im not sure it is a pejorative
read clarissa male characters in novel written by man say it several times
you can duke it out with oed about the etymology the question isnt about synonyms but the process of turning a word into a pejorative when its used about women only
the moon was a thing of mystery and darkness and changeability much like women and their moods which men have never grasped i grasped the moon once
not sure about madam as a brother manageress i may be wrong but i have a feeling the term derives from the french madame the most famous brother managers appear to be french so perhaps madam was coined in this context to give the job an exotic air and ok maybe its not the most respectable job in the world but the position is one of power and authority which appears to run against the argument that the word diminishes the role of women what word could be used instead
if sexism is the quarry thats really fine sexism is a prejudice based gender this paper for example has never written an article on how family courts produce gender based outcomes at a ratio of  to  reflected again in that  of single parent households being one gender why and im just speculating here women a real power house looking on family life as territory a self identity and the security of an old role exactly like men being challenged for the first time over work or votes its a big one and women as a powerful group may not like it the anti sexist moralist meets the pragmatic economic reality of a newspaper and work around it by remaining silent alternatively maybe  of the time a persons physical appearance produces the perfect parent a new concept for medical science to digest who knows yet the statistics are factual sexism is prejudice and no article exists to date free for anyone to speculate on
so guardian article excuses his irrationalities and inaccuracies no what im saying is that a newspaper article is different from an article in a scholarly journal the previous two guardian articles on the rabid feminist issue were pretty appalling though nowhere near as bad as a piece published in the spectator that basically rehashed an earlier piece in the telegraph repeated some inaccuracies and introduced some more david shariatmadaris article above is the first ive come on that is actually worth reading possibly because its the only one ive found that is authored by a competent linguist pejoration seems to me to be applying to the entire language and articles like the above dont seem to slow the decline in fact i would say that its pejoration in action try looking up the word pejoration it has a specific meaning in linguistics i should say i hadnt come on it before reading dss article but it isnt difficult to discover i wont be reading the the routledge language and cultural theory reader even the title makes me cringe im grown up enough to make up my own mind without reference to university texts though i did have a read out of courtesy pretty simplistic i dont really quite follow what youre saying here i dont know whether or not the work in question is used as a university text or not but routledge has quite a high reputation as a publisher of linguistic texts mostly pretty much specialist you dont like the title of the book in which the material is found oh well but youve already made up your own mind so dont need to read it but you read it and found it fairly simplistic well if you found it simplistic assuming you actually read the ten pages relating to this issue and thats what youre referring to as it then all i can say is that your knowledge of historical linguistics must be better than mine so i better defer to you even though you havent provided any evidence other than you own views_ to counter what i said
bastard
so guardian article excuses his irrationalities and inaccuracies pejoration seems to me to be applying to the entire language and articles like the above dont seem to slow the decline in fact i would say that its pejoration in action i wont be reading the the routledge language and cultural theory reader even the title makes me cringe im grown up enough to make up my own mind without reference to university texts though i did have a read out of courtesy pretty simplistic
bitch is a female dog nothing wrong with the word itself if referring to dogs
meanwhile  young yazidi women and girls abducted by isis suffered horrific and prolonged sexual abuse and girls have taken their own lives in desperate attempts to escape the horrors of captivity you were saying
no mine is a normal and accepted use of the word cognate as applied to two stages of a language most linguists believe that pejoration happens more frequently to words that refer to women than those that refer to men im not seeking to prove that here just to convey what the consensus is in the discipline
i wonder what the english language would be like it had evolved exclusively through women
what a lot of cock
well blame language not me
the word is ingénieure just as you have professeure maîtresse de conférences etc
which comments prove which points the crux of the article seems to be that words referring to women go through pejoration over time ergo society is sexist which comments are proof of that on a societal level
in what context was ann oakley using the term a speculation about her teachers perhaps the entire staff of the school were rabid feminists but if so we did not know and we certainly werent
as for the odo rather than the oed it was a rather unfortunate choice well really thats all either article claimed id only otherwise disagree with you that this is a historic example the reason its a bit unfortunate is that it is in common derogatory usage now and there probably wasnt a real need to include it to define the usage i dont really care and wouldnt bother to clamour for its removal myself but some of the responses btl have been kneejerk nonsense about thoughtcrime and so on thats more what i am responding to i wish there were proper thoughtful feminists writing for the graun id agree they could do better on this
no it wouldnt its in this case indicates a contraction which is correct your its would indicate possession which does not apply
i think punctuation is sexy
fair point about abolition at least
the third is his obvious belief that banning such words and meanings will change societys attitudes sorry to disappoint but i certainly dont think that
people usually say ba or bsc these days since those who went to real universities know the real word is baccalaureate of which bachelor is just an approximation
they are cherrypicked as examples where the female version of a word has become derogatory while the male version hasnt maybe there are excellent counterexamples where only the male version has become derogatory but i havent seen any given in the comments only idiotic comments like what about prick
i ve always considered the word bollocks as being the spiritual heart of the english language
no because i already pointed out that regardless of how some sources will define madame madam is indeed widely used as the author suggests which is all that is needed to prove the point it isnt hugely important but at least try to recognise when you are talking twaddle
and i thought of cheese after grating still what do i know
lets rewrite our history to hide the bad things we done so that future generations cannot learn from our ancestors mistakes
so your other points were nonsense but youre still sure the last point was brilliant it might be a fair point about another article than this one all this article does is point out a minor way that language comes to reflect historical sexism in society all the rest of what you are claiming it does is either a reaction to the headline or hysterical exaggeration
id love to know why you removed my last comment given that i expressed support for the article thought of a dozen more examples to support the argument gay dog vs bitch hen party vs stag night boss always a man bossy always a woman etc was it because i also commented on the use of parts of the female anatomy tt and ct although of course i spelt them in full and said that they were always used to denigrate men which i thought was interesting and worthy of comment so why did you delete my comment was it because your monitors dont read the articles theyre supposed to be monitoring or was it because we cant use everyday language to discuss an article about everyday language or is it simply because you just press panic buttons whenever you spot anything which you think might call offense incidentally i am doubly annoyed by your censorship because im a professional translator of dutch into english and i go to great lengths to find ways of removing sexist language from my text which is actually the reason why i read the article in the first place
that would be its pedantry is to be expected from the readers of this article
i was nervous that you were going to go all prescriptive on me fortunately you just avoided that accusation by the skin of your teeth
aye hes not really made the case the assertion that our thinking is shaped by language is always worth discussion but this article doesnt make the case for it im sure he ment well is no knave and is not just pimping his journalistic career english is a fine and sharp instrument it caters for all
im calling the rspca you sicko
very funny
can the words we use to describe women avoid the fate of hussy mistress and courtesan the english language itself is a hussy its slept around with a lot of other languages and absorbed them into its corpus amoebalike why would you want to get rid of a word that itself describes the language perfectly
it has  words historically this is closer to  which gives it the distinction of having the largest vocabulary in the world if you discount legolanguages like german and probably the most multicultural
oup in general is just antiquated in how it does things closed off separated little world of its own so its to be expected its dictionary would be likewise
hold on didnt the term bitch become so overused by rap artists that it began to take on an acceptable positive connotation so much so that women use it to describe other women or themselves which means that language is just a vehicle for thought certainly language encases thought but words are not finite even in the soviet union under an orwellianstyle era of language oppression writers were able to get around the problem just like shostakovich was able to play subtle musical jokes at stalins expense without him knowing certainly etymology is a fine thing but lets not get too precious let language be
i like some of these words need to put them back into vogue
how would you feel about men becoming subordinate to womensome men are subordinate to women they are often referred to as cuckold weak and pathetic i prefer the natural balance that nature has provided not the artificial neofeminist restructuring of the relationship between men and womenhave a happy marriage old chap
mankind was particularly potently pilloried dirty sexist word for human life o wait human
three things mark this out as a piece of sensationalist writing rather than serious analysis more cosmopolitan than guardian the first is the writers focus on the evidence that supports his claims and his disregard of everything that tells a different story the second is his reliance on archaic words and meanings to make his case the third is his obvious belief that banning such words and meanings will change societys attitudes to deal with the last of these first he only has to look at the lack of success of the law banning the use of mobile phones while driving to see that proscription does not always produce the desired results is he really suggesting that the only meaning given in the dictionary entry for mistress should be a female dominant in a bdsm situation that is certainly going to give future students of the life of edward vii an interesting view of his relationships with women should we really ban all words and meanings that describe something that we find unacceptable should we ban the word slavery because we regard the practice as abhorrent will that make it go away there are countless words which have pejorative overtones that are wholly or mainly applied to men bastard today is rarely used to mean an illegitimate child but instead means an unpleasant man cuckold means a man whose partner is adulterous usually behind his back there is a female equivalent of the word but it is virtually unknown prick meaning a stupid person is invariable applied only to males there are plenty of other similar words and all are in current use unlike those discussed by the writer other than in the media and in historical references i cannot recall when i last heard someone use the word mistress in the case of females who have a relationship outside of their marriage the word lover has normally been used though that may imply emotions that are not actually part of the relationship and it has now largely replaced mistress too does anyone actually use the word hussy these days if they do i suggest that it is far more likely to be used by a woman of another woman and when did anyone talk of courtesans or wenches except when writing in the context of history as for madam would female brothel managers prefer to be known as pimps
its perfectly normal for newspapers to contain commentary on culture art literature and sport not just high politics
again it seems youve missed the point of the article let me repeatyes there are plenty of male only slurs just as there are any number of female only slurs thats not the point of the article though the article is about words that once were not slurs and were in fact equivalent to their masculine counterparts those masculine forms are either still in use in the original forms or have dropped from use for men entirely as in the case of spinster whereas the female form of the word has gotten progressively more negative until it has no positive use
english is an incredibly powerful language it has  words with some having  meanings attached to them to be able to identify which of the  is meant you need an incredibly sophisticated grammar which many ignore on the assumption that its your problem but thats only the start the game of play as it is right this instant over the past  years for just english  if you throw in the brythonic and gaelich languages as well there are extra words additional grammar english ditched some tenses and genders over the years but is now trying to reinvent the whole lot extra letters in the alphabet extra phonemes in short if anyone has a problem with english doing this and not doing that why why are you having a problem with it when the words the phrasing the sounds already exist and have existed for a very long time english grammar needs cleaning up not of old rules we need many of those back but of rules that dont assist in conveying explanation if language has a purpose it is to communicate as long as no two people can understand each other without vast numbers of emotes and emoji theres no communication gibbons can convey more than humans they have armwaving emotes but they also have contextualized words are we to be outevolved by our ancient relatives how depressing is that
yes there are plenty of male only slurs just as there are any number of female only slurs thats not the point of the article though the article is about words that once were not slurs and were in fact equivalent to their masculine counterparts those masculine forms are either still in use in the original forms or have dropped from use for men entirely as in the case of spinster whereas the female form of the word has gotten progressively more negative until it has no positive use
that is an impressively selfdeprecating comment
dictionaries are obviously written by men theres a penis in the first syllable language is a bitch
wow isnt this article biased where are the male examples i cant give you a full list of lexical items for males that became derogatory with the time however look at these examples knave a dishonest man old english meaning a boy a servant peacock disapproving a man proud of his appearance since c century and many more of course probably theyre not used very often or already oldfashioned of bookish but they are in the english language and dictionaries reflect that fact whether you want to see or use them or not its a personal choice
oh cmon you cant say anything these days with out some smegger getting offended you cant even complain about camerons use of language about migrants if your not a feminist fascist asshole your an outcast
this article basically plagiarised muriel schulz  essay on the semantic derogation of women
true well said i never once heard the right complaining about abu qatada being carted out the country because of his use of language
alas ltltingénieuregtgt has landed
judging by the response to this article id say the words we use and how we use them are pretty fundamental the comments prove the authors point
geek
stop trying to flip the script this is an entire article criticising language and kaks didnt say he was offended by it finding something surreal and almost frightening being offended by it no an example of being offended is demanding that a dictionary makes alterations to suit your fragile sentiments
it is sexist when one refers to any woman as a bitch or a whore only if the said woman is not a bitch or a whore otherwise you are merely telling the truth
harsh but true
how is a linguist presenting historical facts about the language being politically correct perhaps you like the majority of clearly male posters today have failed to comprehend the article before posting you couldnt just read the article without seeing it through a prism of irrational fears about pc and leftists and whatnot what is so frightening about a few historical facts and do you realise pc is a meaningless term invented by rightwing propagandists to instil fear about an imaginary plot against our freedoms by a totally imaginary type of leftist
sorry is the writer saying that a dictionary should not reflect everyday language use that is an ancient and venerable tradition in france and italy for example which the development of the oed was intended to overcome an exlexicographer writes
i dont know having the time and inclination to winnow through a dictionary for definitions that offend your sensibilities seems a very strong indication of a privileged existence
wanker boofhead bruteyou seemed to forget there are plenty of male only slurs how about some balanced reporting 
oh come on dont be so parochial we can be on the other side of the world and read a book watch a film cant we i dream of being called a great galah and there see what i did i corrected your spelling from the other side of the world too
disgusting
i imagine it was because the comments succeeded in picking apart the entire substance of the article the jessica valenti article on why its sexist that women choose to pay more for pink razors still had comments up or did when i read it yesterday it wouldve been a struggle to find a comment that agreed with jv for the guardian to pick
only frigid and good time have a different meaning when applied to women rather than men
no one is seeking to control the language congratulations to you and to hordes of others contributing today for completely failing to comprehend the article before posting further your references to leftists and pc appear to reflect only an imaginary version of what constitutes a leftist one that doesnt exist in real life but only in the pages of propagandist media like the dm which are aimed squarely at the fearful and the ignorant
rabid dog
there is a new pc actually we are no longer allowed to criticize language for fear of offending people like you
no that would be a man who can get a cricket ball to turn in a particular way
i think there is a correlation between increases in lefty feminism and increases in spinsters
why does the guardian only ever publish articles about sexism perpetrated against females the is never one word about the sexism and misandry perpetrated against males for instance the misandry purpetrated against males in education surely if the paper stood for equality this would be an issue too its very sexist
it would do well to start by refraining from commissioning drivel like this unfortunately its drivel like this that brings in all the clicks
i would like to see a citation for this groundbreaking research  sounds like it might be a little bit of an exaggeration most adjectives describing inferior intellect and dishonesty can be applied to both men and women and there are an awful lot of those
see above you encouraged me
just when you thought we had reached peak guardian along comes this article political correctness is becoming surreal and almost frightening
right im all for rehabilitating these rather quint terms lets have an article for tomorrow with some male versions the only one ive used recently is spinster in connection with my wifes feckless sixty year old american sister who has just put up a facebook post seeking a european husband who will pay for her plane fare to france so she can somehow bum free university courses off french tax payers id be inclined to call her a serving wench if only shed ever done any serving although shes done a bit of wenching in the chaucerian sense during times past
oh i dont doubt it its not necessarily your fault that you dont recognise unstated predispositions that are inherent to your word choices expression and language are deeply ingrained and codified theres all sorts of proclivities tendencies and effects going on all the time that we dont consider because were usually concerned with direct communication but in order to communicate more effectively we load our words with unstated images and references that through repeated use bring about recognition this last point is where the article falls down in my view gendered words like hussy and tart are a symptom not a cause they are used effectively because the words themselves carry enough associations that allow us to recognise the intended meaning more readily its our patterns of thinking that are the problem or would you instead say that my thinking was fd
thugish sexist pot bellied cowardly these are just a few adjectives that are although not exclusively more often than not associated with men rather than women
wait till the hover haters hear about zulu having eight genders and realise the possibility for being offended cnr be exponentiated
but language does the same to men how did you miss the feminist angle
apart from mistress tart and possibly madam the words listed rarely feature in every day conversation unless you are interested in history or literature
is there a reason that she would want to
its extremely encouraging that the vast majority of commenters think that this is a joke
mine too perhaps its our generation
if thats so its interesting that that these figures are being pegoritivly compared to an eighteenth and nineteenth century slang term for female genitalia nicely forwards the argument
but the guardian isnt a blog post it is media outlet that is duty bound to perform particular social functions and answers to various laws ethics and codes of practice pertinent to the industry it operates in readers have a right to expect that accredited media organisations adhere to the responsibilities that those organisations have agreed to perform and fulfill it isnt a matter of if you dont like it dont read it the guardian needs to be held accountable for its content that content should report on events and reflect various social phenomena in a manner that is proportionate to both their level of importance and their magnitude of occurrence
um no england males at that invented universal education and healthcare just to start which in my mind is a touch more important than words having multiple meanings
you could also argue that in that context a mistress has a huge amount of power being able to end a mans marriage in a time and place where that really mattered also that a mistress really had what a lot of feminists wanted that is money comfort and sex as desired without being legally tied to a man allowing more freedom than any women who werent mistresses but then lets just say the word is bad and ignore the fact it was respectable women who made it bad because they cant abide by other women having what they want but not the guts to get also women have always been in charge of the language especially when it comes to being gossips about other women the male equivalent of gossip is to berate btw tell me which word is worse a berater or a gossiper
unerringly the search for things to be inconsolably offended about must lead eventually into ribald self parody and becoming an irredeemable lampoon
histrionic is derived from the latin word for actor and lunatic from the latin for moon how do these emanate from preoccupations with the female body all three words can be and are applied to both genders hysterical which is derived from the word for womb is clearly genderspecific in its origins
all of new zealand for starters
im  and speak deep am a bit clumsy and quiet when around people i dont know to many people that means i am stupid because that is the steryotype as heros are always fairly short and they need someone to out think or if it is a superhero movie to beat up for suggesting that the hero stops stalking his gf
the language is also full of words which are offensive to lefthanded people
and an axe surrounded and strengthen by a bunch of faggots is a fascist which was a military symbol of the roman empire the axe being the military and the sticks being the people the axe is made stronger by the people and can defend them with the implied threat that it can cut them up which of course that all self identified fascists are calling themselves faggots
i would say that lunatic is more to do with the collectives noticing that there are more crimes and strange behaviours on nights of the full moon in a statistical provable noticeable way for that my personal theory is that the additional light keeps people awake and allows people to be out easier
let us remember that being a bastard was so bad it took an act of the king to legitimise someone
when adam delved and eve spanwho was then the gentleman
still a lot better than that language where a married woman isnt aloud to use any of the letters in her husbands name
when you wear red spectacles everything looks red
quim fell from colloquial usage years ago but in  it is being revived to refer to certain highranking politicians and church figures
as the writer of the article points out rabid can be applied to any ranting idealogue i have come across plenty of rabid tories that the oxford dictionary happened to choose that example of usage while perhaps unfortunate does not imply that all feminists are rabid if the dictionary cited a rabid dog as an example of usage when the word is used to refer to the disease it would not mean that only dogs can contract rabies or that all dogs were rabid
hi welcome to opinion the place for reading opinions sometimes called opeds think pieces or even editorials where relevant for news use your mouse or touch screen to select news in your preferred internet browser thanks
do not forget the intonation of those words is also important to the meaning
thanks hammers i stand corrected
my first thought was goes the weasel
what on earth does that mean
that is idiotic
hovering around peak guardian once more
i think guardian journalists are actually foul tempered ais that us commentators are tasked with explaining how to be human to
good job he didnt follow through hed have had to call you the queen
seems the woosh applies to you but yeah identity politics and power play and the big bad patriacrchy i get it its bollocks but i get it
this is all getting ridiculous i dont get upset when westcountry women shop assistants refer to me as my lover or when a woman behind a bakery counter in yorkshire calls me pet or when a dinner lady in staffordshire calls me my love get a grip ffs
my uncle used to talk about the boys down the club when he and they were in their s while my dad used to talk about the lads in a similar fashion exactly i sometimes refer to my male friends as the boys theyre mostly in their s and s similarly girls can be any age
utter twaddle is that literally your position in work a power play outside its endearment my point is that in context taking a brief second to consider how to address a female colleague might make a big difference to them thats all this isnt a huge thing it isnt an absolute rebecca nicholson isnt saying its an absolute either just that to many women its worth taking the time to consider thats fair dont you think heres another instance my mum was an attorneys assistant in her office there were both men and women in that role but the male assistants were always by their names by the attorneys who were all men the female assistants were addressed by the terms the author points out above i saw firsthand the effects of being called dear by the men she worked for its longterm effect was belittling
ha hah proof if proof were needed tvm xx
that was an awesome orgy
yes they could but they purposefully and actively do not want to
dont forget to have the daily mail in your other hand that way you will be able to offend everyone no exceptions
princess love girl when is a term of endearment not welcome well crucially of course its all about context it will always depend on the who what when where and why thats that settled then
might be horrible but its not the end of the world i can think of many worse things
who mentioned fawley towers though now you do mention it
time to take the broom handle out of your butt squire if you dont find squire offensive hopefully
and yet  comment will appear on some audience engagement dashboard as a great success especially against the minimal cost of the article
a night out with the girlsthe boys are back in towni agree though context is all but one persons context is another persons inappropriate also lots of terms are very local affectionate in some areas asking for a black eye and being kicked out of dodge city in others
oh rebecca love get a life
this article is tongue in cheek right
most of the time ive heard mature women referred to as girls is by other women we had a great girls night out etc
when most australian sportsmen refer to their team mates as the boys should those team mates object and when many of the local shop assistants address me as darl should i be offended and i only recently stopped referring to myself as a wollongong boy mostly because my connections to that former home city were cut far too long ago to continue saying it and not because i was offending myself with the apparently patronising label of boy
one male primary school teacher called the girls love and darling thats just creepy irrespective of whether its patronising or not
it almost as if it all depends on the context and the intent and you cant really legislate around that easily which is why you get silly identity politics and cultural crusades as evidenced in this article which take the long discredited approach of the dreadded zerotolerance appoach where anything which can be vaguely construed to be the kissingcousin of a rumour of a hint of a whiff of offence is absolutely verboten and subject to the cultural death penalty and if you dont agree then youre a monster and persecutor of helpless victims which theyre here to protect no charge all in a days work the true heroes we deserve please give a donation to help the guardian continue its mission and undertake this important work
personally id rather someone belittle me to my face then do it behind my back disagree being openly belittled to your face is fucking horrible especially if the room is on the side of the belittler theres nothing worse than someone being all like im going to openly patronise you and you have to sit there and take it when it comes to insults on the other hand id prefer those to my face than behind my back
not wanting to get into a disagreement too much theres one difference girl is equivalent to boy and boy alone chap fella and the allimportant guy dont going off memory have a female equivalent lad has lass at least girl and boy are childrens terms so the fact we end up using girl as the female equivalent to guy does say something calling an adult male a boy is done but it can easily be offensive because its infantilising them with girl being analogue to both boy and guy you can see why theres a mess fun fact girl used to be a gender neutral term so did man i want those days back so all this linguistic mess can sod off
aye but not this kind of shit toby
its all the people who sit around thinking up insignificant crap to be outraged aboutmy wife one got killed up at a meeting for using the phrase nitty gritty as the objected said it was racially offensive as it had its roots in the slave tradefunny but to this day you can hear it every day on the media and no one objects or complainsno doubt fluff from navel picker will read this and complain now
i always thought that underwear in a twist referred to the narrow bits at the sides of the underwear twisting around itself to form a kind of taut rope this twist is less likely to occur in boxer shorts styled underwear which is traditionally a male garment and similar styles including the boyleg style ill have to leave it for someone else to unpack the gendered associations that make up the term boyleg because ive just image searched boyleg and it turns out that i maybe some time
excellent article rebecca well done pet
its also the termsofdisparagement thing where you refer to ppl in a slightly insulting way which is obviuosly sarcastic the point being that you have such a fondness for the person you both can have a wee pop at each other for gods sake why do i have to explain this
can we possibly become any more oversensitive yes
dont go to sheffield
whoosh
how is girl a belittling term my daughters are all proud to be girls theres no specific delineation between girl and woman you could be one or the other at most ages depending on how you behave how others pereceive you how old those perceivers are your social context etc
agree on this instance i cant imagine them using the term boy or even guy for a man in this context so it comes across as demeaning
me think that the previous paragraphs were deliberately provocative clickbait on the other hand that does slightly pay the bills clickbate is the future at least they dont spread articles over many pages one picture amp a few sentences per page glaring at certain other online magazines here
youre not weird youre a normal person strayed into weird hq
there goes my night out with the lads and sack all of the sheffield bus drivers who use the word luv for both lads and lasses without the slightest hint of demeaning a bit disconcerting to a red blooded male visitor when first hearing itmaybe we should just refer to everyone as homo sapiens or man as we are all man despite some of us being women
so completely unlike men being called boys boys with toys lads and suchlike
happened to me in the fearnsides in dewsbury ex rugby league player gave me my beer and said there you go luvbut i do have to add that i did not feel patronized one bit
i refer to all my work colleagues as fat whore men and women and they dont mind a bit
i thought it was short for petal
give him a call important to stay in touch with old friends just be mindful to correct him on his inappropriate lexicon
jesus christ get a life if it was a female presenter whod spoken about the boys it would have been equally meaningless
but he didnt respect her so would you have preferred he lied to her david cameron showed himself up to be what he really is you would have prefered him to have hidden his true self why surely its best to know who your enemies are
does cariad mean darling with you as it does in welsh
true but thats not quite the ops point or what my response was referring to child is different because in the legal sense it does have a fixed ageendpoint if you call a yearold child and theyre not one of your offspring then youre patronising and asking for trouble if you call her a girl different considerations come into play
paul hollywood is in the same age bracket albeit a couple of years older as mel and sue and somewhat younger than mary berry working class women you may even encounter them serving you in some capacity are as wont to call men love or darling as men are to address women with the same terms its far from unknown for women to refer to male friends colleagues relatives as the boys i sense a little bit of power dynamics in your closing anecdote i wonder was the trouser trumpeteer somewhat prolier than thou and did this contribute to your reaction im not sure whats left standing from the above but perhaps we should remove all terms of endearment from public life and address one another as citizen or comrade
hon hon surely that must be offensive to someone somewhere with too much spare time and nothing on points of view to complain about 
what an absolute waste of time this is come on guardian you can do better than this they can who knew
i think the whole point is that it absolutely does
if my waitress and my bus driver call me love its not a term of endearment at all its just a convention they almost certainly do the same to all of their customers gender age and loveliness irrelevant if the guy at the bus stop calls me love on the other hand its because hes asserting a right to be familiar he wouldnt say it to a man the two are completely different and the second is objectionable
ooo you should have warned me youd be offended could you not have sent me a virtual business card with your list of things to avoid that might easily upset you
what about gal im sure ive heard that applied to all ages without offence
what an absolute waste of time this is come on guardian you can do better than this
my favourite ever was a front page story in the london evening standard a few years ago about sky news anchor kay burley the headline called her a tv news girl this referring to a woman in her s with over  years of journalistic experience regardless of what you might think of her can you imagine huw edwards being called a news boy shockingly the editor at the time was a girl i mean woman
that wasnt the speakers intent if the audience chose to view it as being belittled then that was their choice but im sure no lasting damage was done personally id rather someone belittle me to my face then do it behind my back
sometimes ill say girl or even kid as in come on kid occasionally itll be babe baby or sometimes babs theres been the odd darling and sis and even mum i must admit ive never used honeybunny yet it doesnt really matter what i say anyway because im inside my car and saying it behind the windscreen as i stop in the road to let a lady cross
this article deserves all the scorn delivered below in the comments the beedin obvious conclusion in the last paragraph makes me think that the previous paragraphs were deliberately provocative clickbait
oh do sod off
can we possibly become any more oversensitive
yes cheers thats another good example of the sort of boring and predicable stuff were seeing
using a diminutive solely in the linguistic sense of diminutive generally conveys affection in the latinate languages we can see that clearly when something or someone is given a suffix of etta ette ita and the same holds true for masculine nouns where english differs is that we have no grammatical way of imbuing a reference with such a flavour other than ling which has fallen out of favour and noone would really like to be referred to as a somethingling so our everflexible language adapts and provides pseudonyms differing terminology and pet names if we are fond of a male we say mate buddy lad boy nautical terms as it happens if we are fond of a female we say darling the exception to the ling rule sweetness flower pet girl do you see where this is going i can see how pet would be controversial but im from the north east so take from that what you will otherwise these are terms of affection solely intended as such and as far as i have encountered met with nothing but favour being nice is couched sometimes in the pronouns we apply to others thats kind of all it is there is no overarching scheme by the patriarchy to diminish women by their pseudonyms i would have it that its actually a mark of respect and amicability believe me the patriarchy has other much more effective ways of putting girls in their place without resorting to the fabric of linguistics
good point 
a whole word you say all by yourself impressive keep trying hard maybe another one will join it and then youll be well on the way to a full sentence
whenever i see the words safe space i always think of safe word
i believe the actual phrase is youll never land a man if you keep that tash treacle
thats not turning it on its head youre annoyed at being called babe when youre male turning it on its head is a male till operator not colleague you changed the situation there calling a woman mate
you mean well me old pal me old beauty if forbidden now great newsmum was sigh is a huge archers fan i still remember despite much effort that bloody catchphrase even over forty years later the first archers words ever broadcast well me old pal me old beauty were spoken by walter gabriel on may  
because im sure that happens all the time in 
who cares
its hardi hate being called love but i know its actually not being said in a negative way usually dear i find more condesending the older people often say duck here im not offended but its weird
just carry a copy of the guardian around with you then everyone will know you hate everything and will leave you alone
im sure others have said the same and the end of the article does conclude the same but it is all about context i have to agree in general that using girl towards an adult woman is mostly demeaning just as much as someone referring to me as boy would be demeaning also
some might suggest that fellow is weighted toward the masculine rather than used equally furthermore human has man in it and thus implies that male is the default setting which in turn explains that male is the at fault settingive just now experimented with greetings addressed to bipeds vertebrates and limbic systems and all were found to be problematic on some level it appears that the best fit solution would be greetings organ bag
heres a perfect example when david cameron said calm down dear to angela eagle in the house of commons instead of treating a fellow minister with respect as he most certainly would have had she been a man he utterly demeaned her and trivialised her arguments imagine him saying calm down boy to a male colleague its fair to say that the gauntlet had been thrown
yes where is this place
its kind of hard to know what to do with this comment did the busboy look cowed or upset if so i agree that this behaviour is wrong but also its possible that they had a friendly work relationship and youre politicising something innocent
this isnt about what you call people in your family this is about strangers and workplace colleagues my partner used to call my father jokingly rightwing bastard and was jokingly called in return  the deluded socialist wouldnt recommend using either of those in the workplace
im so so sorry
im thinking of a word here shame i cant post it
i think for the benefit of everyone people must now introduce themselves clearly with a list of things they are offended by in fact to save time why not type the list out and put it on some business cards you can handily hand them to people before they even utter a word to you this can take place in a shop the street every interaction at work with the plumber repair person note the lack of gender for the easily offended etc on the flip side for us sane people it will also help us identify the people to quickly walk away from one look at the card will mark you out as a nutter on the flip flip side this will limit human interaction for the preoffended party to be offended at things so really its a winwin
sarcastic and superior comments like yours
he was actually very funny and likeable although i think all the weed he did had something to do with his personality
i think its not healthy to treat something that minor and arbitrary as some kind of challenge to your masculinity its got bugger all to do with masculinity its about different language used by different genders turn it on its head what if a male colleague addressed a female college in a meeting as babe or hon would you not think that was demeaning i would certainly think that they had crossed a boundary people are being asked to think before they talk in case they offend someone by poor choice of words but it seems that some people are expressly being excused for their poor choice of language wc fields once said a womans place is in the wrong he was almost right he just got the gender wrong
no nobodys saying you have to feel weird about that
hot fuzzdanny so what made you want to become a policemannicholas officerdanny what made you want to become a policemanofficer
no the article is complaining about the phrase the girls as used of a group of women that you worked with in a social kind of way as this is reality tv were talking about
northern lass aright cock me ive never had any complaints
you just saved the whole article at the end as a brother to  very strong sisters i struggle with this often
no but maybe youre just disgruntled and ugly

real grievances is health amp safety gone mad stopping my local sweetshop from using her grandmothers lead scales
do not quite understand the point of this article except to state in as many words as possible the epithet that surely the context is everything we have manchester girls and boys schools but they are all pupils my uncle used to talk about the boys down the club when he and they were in their s while my dad used to talk about the lads in a similar fashion this was all done with affection for those concerned and i wouldnt be surprised if paul hollywood was doing something similar i think the media are now going overboard in highlighting every perceived injustice and are in danger of trivialising what is a serious issue i fear a backlash if articles like this continue in this vein and we are all frightened to open our mouths in case we accidentally put our feet in them
patronising and possessive in this day of outrage about sexual harrassment i recall a gay waiter at a restaurant near where i live he kept calling over the busboy to help clear the table when he did come over he would refer to him as darling and put his unsolicited hand on his shoulder in front of us i wish i had spoken up at the time the restaurant is no longer open it annoys me that we passively sat there and let it happen in the us where this happened it is considered socially unacceptable not to give a tip at restaurants but the only person who deserved a tip at that place was the busboy for all the sexual harrassment that he had to put up with
so true i call my wife and daughter the girls my sisters wereare always the girls now i have to feel weird about the connotations of that
he sounds awful
so how often has your most senior manager at work called you sweetheart or darling this year because that is the problem we are complaining about not the grandma who scans your shopping unless shes also your senior manager
i think we should change the welsh anthem to land of my mother 
brilliant
no north koreas are bigger or are the people wearing them smaller not sure
it is rather unpatriotic to associate your country with these lowgrade verses didnt you have a better poet in all your history
i think intent is everything and in particular the usage of the base word man in english man originally meant person and still does and it was only much later that it started to also be used for males so when lyrics refer to man or men the intent behind the person who wrote those lyrics needs to be examined
both tony benn summed it up best when he said if one meets a powerful person ask them five questions what power have you got where did you get it from in whose interests do you exercise it to whom are you accountable and how can we get rid of you if you cannot get rid of the people who govern you you do not live in a democratic system
i wouldnt sell you a truck load of fertiliser no matter how much you offered me you sound like the sort of chap who would blow up a government building on general principles
national anthems are pathetic the fact that humans need to invoke god in their anthems just shows what a pathetic insecure species humans are god if he existed wouldnt give a flying ratsass about your shitty country

be careful when referring to democracy in switzerland the most democratic country in the world women didnt vote until 
coming tomorrow which is the most sexiest national anthem penned by derek trotter
gendernutral pronouns sound great until you discover that in practice they severely limit the number of nous antecedents they can refer back to french with il and elle can carry two while in theory english with he she and it and possibly they can carry three or four i think in english we should accept they as a neutral pronoun for the singular as well as the plural which will disturb some but less perhaps than a madeup word
oh they said sexistoh
as attributed to winston churchill there are three things i like about italian ships first their cuisine which is unsurpassed second their service which is quite superb and then in time of emergency there is none of this nonsense about women and children first
is this discussion of any use to anybody im a man who has no problem living in a country referred to as a she i dont feel left out or discriminated against i am very proud to be a citizen of my country in great britain there is a queen so it is logical to me that god save the queen is sung god save the king is sung when they have a king and they can change it to god save the monarch when they get a genderneutral monarch after all the british national anthem always refers to the monarchy doesnt it the only other solution if they are not satisfied with the status quo would be to abolish the monarchy and compose a completely new national anthem but you cant please everybody all the time can you
in italian most countries are female with a few exceptions japan portugal and belgium are the first that come to mind
spains anthems lack of words has not prevented scurrilous alternative versions one i like is franco franco que tiene el culo blanco porque su mujer lo lava con ariella reina sofia se lava con lejía i don pinpon se lava con jabon franco franco has a white bumbecause his wife washes it with ariel automaticqueen sofia washes it with bleachand mr pinpon washes it with soap is that a bit sexist
try france
grammatical gender isnt the same thing as actual gender while theres masculine feminine and neuter in many languages they dont necessarily correspond with sexual characteristics
and you could hardly call india islamic i think mr horner has an agenda
its full of references to her majesty you are all evidently too young to remember when we sang god save the king
god save the queen is disgustingly sexist i suggest god save the monarch opinions
so lets start a campaign to make all national anthems nation neutral nonsense flanders and swann had the right idea
the first line of our national anthem contains two references that i find completely offensive god and queen should be updated to mythical sky deity kind extend further unjustified privileges to an undemocratic feudal anachronism although it doesnt scan too well
i get around the problem by not knowing my national anthem
what rubbish la patria is feminin not masculine the a at the end of the word is a bit of a give away
yes in all thy sons command is outdated and should be changed eventually the second verse is lovely o canada where pines and maples growgreat prairies spread and lordly rivers flowhow dear to us thy broad domainfrom east to western seathou land of hope for all who toilthou true north strong and free still the best most beautiful country on the face of the earth 
the irish national anthem contains the words sons of the gael men of the pale shall set the tyrant quaking the tyrant in question wastrails off
but thats what im saying for example the madman reference it is gender neutral in turkish there is no man on the end of it a better translation would be mad person obviously the writer just looked up wikipedia like you and i did but the translations arent accurate enough if you are to do a study of the gender bias in anthems makes me doubt the accuracy of the other anthems which i cant read in the original languageand the villanous men there is no man in the original turkish villanous person would be more accurate or villians is even more accurate no mention of gender at all in the turkish
and slave comes from slav it is where many of the roman slaves came from also ciao means i am your slave as it comes from sciavo slave in venetian
theres a whole vista of quantum aggressions to be documented yet manspreading was just the start
i dont want anything just saying god save the person of this specific gender can never be gender neutral
in italy it is the mother land
its political correctness mad we should stop pretending equality can exist and go back to being racist and sexist not thatwe ever really stopped
our national anthem is a joke and an embarrassment the french do it much better
i dont know which is the most sexist and i dont care but i do know which is the worst god save the queen the lyrics are awful and i am embarrassed whenever i hear it
you are obviously not paying attention to the important things in life
captain harrington the titanic is sinking women and children first guardian comments my male rights are being infringed i find this offensive bloomin fourth wave feminists
yes because a song that represents your country is exactly the same as an instruction manual this thread is a perfect example of how the privileged dont see a problem with something that excludes the nonprivileged
the british national anthem is hugely sexist god save our gracious queen
uk takes no god save the queen is sexist to all gay men leave them alone
and god save the queen is genderneutral according to the gs hacks thats because queen is interchangeable with king depending on who the current monarch is doh
its god save the king when a male is on the throne what would you want god save the reigning person
youre right the anthem as its always sung has no gendered words
all nouns have a gender because words have their own personality um no they have gender because they well have gender its actually a very practical thing in a language with loose word order to have nouns come in several classes you worry much less about potentially ambiguous syntax in complex sentences and gender is just the most intuitive classification people come up with to ascribe it to words having personalities whatever that even means is to unnecessarily exoticise the phenomenon which i do realise is a rather pc complaint either way its not particularly relevant in the first place you dont even remotely have to degender a language to give it some genderneutral options
so a national anthem representing its female citizens is unimportant and irrelevant then what are you saying that we should all just stay locked up in the house and not participate in society
and yet you read it considered it and commented on it and even replied to at least one other persons comments on it i wish i had the spare time to comment on frivolous articles oh wait 
i thought it said which is the most sexiest national anthem and was all set to get cross about the poor grammar
god save the queen is totally awful and uninspiring dirge the french have a much better national anthem
you find this amusing steps away from internet
kinda curious what an atheist could sing they cant really appeal to god after all
sounds like youd all be more comfortable on the daily mail site
just to clarify gender grammatical gender das mädchen nuff said
no blind spots here
who cares this whole subject is so unimportant its saddening is it really a predicament of any kind that anthems made hundreds of years in the past used sons instead of daughters and such if it bothers you just change it its not like youre a traitor to your country if you make it gender neutral furthermore this is not sexism and if you think its sexism youre a stupid person sexism is defined as discrimination based on being a male or a female canadians germans americans italians etc are not given nor are they denied rights due to their gender so they are not sexist and nor is their anthem seriously lets just worry about more important things than this nonsense
and yet you all keep coming back for your two minutes hate
no really
god save the queen is gender neutral
oh i dunno flower of scotland isnt that bad yes it is
are the swedes considering converting their language to glagwegian
im just hoping that my lifes span and that of my children and grandchildren are spent before the return of the death camps its not looking good
precisely oh god everything is sexist
fathers plural sounds pretty pc
dammit to grow not not to grow you get the idea
did you mean to write edward
i saw the other article as well and took this to be serious if they stuck to gillian anderson and talyor swift this wouldnt be happening is it serious or not
agree the first verse of the nz anthem has three references to god its always why i preferred singing the maori version
one question if a man has a beard and a feminist is radical enough not to grow her lady beard will they stick together like velcro
in most languages apart from english all nouns have a gender because words have their own personality do away with this and you do away with much of their poetry in german the word vaterland is neutral but if you want to wax lyrical about the country you can call it germania giving it a feminine personality political correctness is a form of philistinism apart from anything else
ok i am extremely jealous of anyone who has the time and energy to worry about an issue like this i have just checked my list of things to do in my life when i have the time money energy and get round to them and analyse gender weighting of national anthems doesnt seem to be on there at all i think a you people have too much spare time b you dont have enough to do c worry about things that dont need to be worried about just for the sake of it
if we must go back to ancient and dead languages in order to do some sexist etymology research this means we are completely nuts family comes from famulo latin for slave
ok disregard tempus is masculine never judge a latin word by its ending or a russian one too for that matter but погода is still very much feminine
it seems we havent progressef very far from when jonathan swift satirised silly arguments talking about which end of the egg should be cracked first
rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air how could that possibly be construed as phallic please explain
canadians in general are definitely not that concerned one liberal backbencher is grandstanding thats all
a pretentious what au vin
hello there tempus is masculine and погода is feminine
its actually very progressiveregular gender reassignment 
well it refers to a brotherhood not a sisterhood 
which is the most sexist national anthem maybe this isnt so much peak guardian as poes law without a clear indicator of an authors intended sarcasm it becomes impossible to tell the difference between an expression of sincere extremism and a parody of extremism if this had appeared as an example of improbable research a regular feature in the education section of the guardian one could view it as a humorous take on both academic research and methodology as well as gender issues on the other hand in the context where the paper will run articles how on genderneutral dresses will produce more female engineers the impression is that we are meant to take this article just as seriously maybe its just getting difficult to spot whether an author is just having a laugh or genuinely fighting sexism
quite possibly i think beards are currently ok as some people who work in coffee shops in islington can be seen sporting them as soon as they go back being associated with the lower orders people who like rock music ect they can be reclassified as a gender conspiracy designed to oppress women by being all scratchy and having dried egg in them
it doesnt seem odd to me i speak spanish and know some french italian latin german and a tiny bit of russian
nope the guardian have always published about  of articles on the topic of feminism
it is called the internationale
of course it did not occur to the guardian to consider the great antinational international anthem the internationale i see nothing wrong in the fact that the third stanza gives a feminine interpretation of the word equality the state oppresses and the law cheatstax bleeds the unfortunateno duty is imposed on the richthe rights of the poor is an empty phraseenough languishing in custodyequality wants other lawsno rights without duties she saysequally no duties without rights does anyone else it really is time that political correctness was attacked from the left not just from the right
if man is the single greatest threat to this planet what threat does woman pose im being facetious of course but the analysis done above is too simplistic in many cases masculine sounding words are gender neutral either inherently or in certain contexts also beware modifying elements of historyculture should we neuter all of the works of the great renaissance artists having said that i wouldnt be too worried about tweaking the words of songs as they are pretty pointless anyway
indeed why ask something that doesnt exist to preserve something that shouldnt exist
its grammatical gender
this is what happens when youre not allowed to correct children with a mild clout round the head
goddamn it man shes a queen not a doctor
important stuff is there a chart which shows how we rank in terms of sexual orientation equality id figure wed rank pretty high
besides its an anthem traditionally played by military bands how many women are in those bands eh
finnish is gender neutral and this inspires most finns to totally fuck up their learning of english
i think if charles was king the anthem would have to be god save the queen
what about an anthem that republican atheists can sing with pride not everyone wants god to save royalty
an old polish scifi comedy a sadly underappreciated genre
the canadian national anthem is an unlistenable dirge and i say that as a canadian thankfully outside of the notrealolympics its seldom heard on the world stage but changing in all our sons to in all our hearts or in all of us is hardly giving in to the cartoon militant feminism that canadian tories like to imagine is rife across the land in the rare moments when theyre not wanking over imaginary terrorist threats that is itd be more fun if m bélanger had complained about all the references to the deity thatd have the christian amp missionary alliance our pms whackjob cult up in arms the original french version is better anyway as it talks about protecting our foyers if my sub o level memory serves me correctly
the eu offers a wide choice of monarch you could move to spain
god defend new zealand while we push through more cuts to the armed forces budget
in some cases the gender bias is about how a country refers to itself germany and russia are respectively the vaterland and otechestvo meaning the fatherland a notion whose roots date back to the ancient greek patris and the ancient roman word patria in other words calling it gender bias is a failure of presentism and revisionism no judgement was inferred on any possible disparaging or discriminatory use of a genderspecific term the words were simply counted and placed in the relevant column not the least however this definition of bias is based on pure termdropping is funny if we for example take the old full version of the national anthem of germany it mentions german women repeatedly but by repeating the same phrase time and time again a phrase in which german women are put on the same level as german wine as something germany is supposedly famous about now while the authors would not have counted the repeat mentioning of the term they would have happily ignored the objectification sorry this article is a case of garbage ingtgarbage out when you use tools unsuitable for the task at hand you can only conclude nonsense
not sure if i agree with the position for brazils anthem it looks very genderneutral to me its interesting that brazil is called pátria in the lyrics which eytomologically means fatherland but it is a feminine noun so it is followed by feminine adjectives but then it pátria is finally called the mother of all the children of this soil i think they probably didnt think it was gender neutral because of the use of the word filho which some would translate as son but since portuguese has no separate word for children and the words for son and daughter are not different they are the same word inflected differently i fail to see how this refers only to sons i would translate it as children
im glad you pointed this out none of the other commenters seem to have noticed
i am increasingly finding i am getting sidetracked by bullshit
did you allow for plurals in many cases the plural for both men and women is masculine and only all women would it be feminine so in italian for example everyone and all men would be tutti while all females would be tutte
what a curious thing to say unless you were a wholesale fertilizer merchant in which case i applaud your diligence and take not the least offence in your attempt at psychologically profiling me i am neither an islamist nor an anarchist nor a horticulturalist so i have no need of your services im sorry if my demeanour gave you reason to suppose otherwise
what do the spanish crowds do during the anthem at sporting events hum whistle talk among themselves
dont they have better things to worry about i am a pretty liberal person but this is just stupid a song is a song i like the russian national anthem myself that doesnt make me a putin lackey or some sort of fifth column for russia here in the united states i dont even know what the words mean i just like the music in fact i like a lot of russian music
thanks for that what about igneous rock we need to know these things
the swedish pronoun hen could be seen as a replacement for the rather clumsy hanhon heshe but it would be a mistake to take it further than that its just an addition to the language not part of a scheme to make the genderspecific and binary pronouns less relevant
kingdom sorry
oh please stop this appalling nonsense and reduce the need for humanity oh god it has the word man in it to regurgitate
i also read through the australian national anthem and sons are mentioned once and fatherland once nope no sons no fatherland we had sons until  but got rid of them and made it genderinclusive the sky failed to fall canadians might be pleased to note
smh 
you misread the headline zolotoy
in russian otechestvo fatherland refers to the fatherly figure but the word itself is of neutral gender also words such as russia rossiya kingrom derjava and country strana which both appear in the anthem are all feminine in the russian language i dont know which coclusion is correct here but the anthem seems more neutral if not feminine to me
also an israelitaly test match
uk national anthem  isnt that just for the english mae hen wlad 
in french the first two countries you mention are masc but it is la belgique i think in french it probably depends on the sound and spelling of the name ie whether it looks and sounds more masc or fem in that language hence le bresil le pakistan but la russie la chine
the word changes depending on the gender of the reigning monarch
however i see potential for a guardian piece on sexism in ancient hebrew testifying practices
it was about  years ago so i do not remember examples but there were numerous places where it was important not to have any possibility of confusing singular and plural and the oup editors did not back then accept theytheir as singular gender neutral pronouns
folk etymology would relate testify to testicles  but the romans did not swear to tell the whole truth on their gonads just a myth never seen in a trial however the ancient hebrews did genesis 
due to the guardian not having a simple way to list columns by date printed could you point me towards the empowering selfies article sounds like a laugh sorry i cant find it now the arrangement of stories on this site is ridiculous
most sexiest what an embarrassment this rag is
the welsh anthem is studiously gender neutral at least in the easytorememberforthesaes version my hen laid a haddock one hand oiled a fleaglad farts and centurions threw dogs in the seai could stew a hare here and brandish dans flandons ruddy bogs blocked up with sand cytgan chorus dad dad why dont you oil auntie gladcan whores appear in beer bottle pieso butter the hens as they fly a bit speciesist mind ewe
i once heard thus spake zarathustra performed by an allkazoo orchestra of at least  people it was magnificent respect the kazoo
this article is factually incorrect and ignorant in terms of its commentary on the turkish national anthem it should be corrected as soon as possible there isnt one single reference to gender in the two verses of the turkish anthem that is sung as a native turkish speaker i fail to see the men and sons that the author is talking about before anything turkish is a genderless language roughly like japanese korean finnish and chinese the language has one personal pronoun that refers to both genders nouns have a generic form and this generic form is used for both males and females what sweden is trying to achieve with their new genderneutral pronoun hen was an integral part of the turkish language for the last  years the turkish pronoun o refers to hesheit and onu to herhimit i am ashamed by the ignorance in this article i wish the authors checked their resources before ranking the turkish anthem as the most sexist
pointless nonissue why arent i surprised
what no canada you should asses both the english and french renditions of oh canada and also post a video of ginette reno singing the bilingual version at the bell centre before the habs game httpyoutubejhpruapgcy
but it is completely onesided as it is now and has been for the last  years leaving me alienated and bereft
sorry or make a horn sign old mithraian tradition to ward off the likelihood of it happening
i have just finished listening to it and you are right amazing in a scary way did you read the words they seem to be very keen in geology as a side note the last verse of the italian anthem reads something like we are ready for death god has called and many italians will touch their balls or
youre absolutely right where can satanic copraphagists go to get their news these days
you are correct that is exactly how it is meant obviously the modern meaning has changed and  of italians have no idea where the word comes from
seriously im baffled by this conclusion too theres one male word in the entire  verses of the original poem and no male words in the  verses that are actually sung as the national anthem
boggles the mind
interesting to leave out irelands anthemwhich btw is very definitely more male in both irish and english
however apparently  dont read instruction manuals because they think they know better so it all balances out somehow 
your solution seems as inelegant as the problem just use theytheir perfectly acceptable longstanding gender neutral pronouns used for the singular
they would be highly employable at httpwwwbbccoukcareershome
well as an austrian woman see reference above i wasnt particularly bothered by the old sexist version i never assumed its reference to sons was somehow a veiled reference telling me to stay locked up in the house and not participate in society not least because its author was a woman in the first place and while the symbolism of the change is nice passing the law wasted months and months of parliamentary time which could certainly have been better employed elsewhere and i have a lot of sympathy for all those who still sing the old version even when in the case of public figures it inevitably results in a public shitstorm because the hard truth is even after removing two words to grammatically questionable effect to shoehorn in daughters the word is still too long and the result sounds pretty awful musically i suppose one could just scrap the whole thing and start afresh but why bother were not the usa no one ever sings the anthem apart from international sporting events and it is at least mercifully free from references to god or martial prowesswar where the old version went heimat bist du großer söhne you are the homeland of great sons the new one runs heimat großer söhne tochter homeland of great sons daughter of course it would have been more sensible and truly genderneutral to simply replace sons with kinder children but then that would have sounded slightly infantilising and anyway since when are politicians sensible
the proclaimers sheena easton the bay city rollers shang a lang what exactly was going to replace it
sounds like youd all be more comfortable on the daily mail site the daily mail and the guardian are identical in ideology it amuses me when the british guardianista try to pretend this is not the case
the archers
the turkish national anthem has only one maleoriented word in it the author obviously just read through the english translation without looking at the original even after acknowledging the maori case
in any case the anthem is never sung in english and the only verse usually sung in irish refers more vaguely to the obligation not to allow the country to be left under tyranny or slavery not dissimilar to the marseillaise
i went to a girls school our school song referenced the schools sons
john bull obviously the men of the pale reference is to the irish of english origin
and while were at it can we drop the antiquated references to the old gods
national anthems really are curious animals for instance some of the mildest countries boast bloodthirsty threats others have music totally alien to the culture of the country th century wagnerian rumbles in africa a delightful rossinilike overture for brazilthe scariest national anthem of all has to be montenegros it sounds like a giant horde of startrooper zombies going off to take on the legion of vampire monsters once heard you can never shake off its nightmarish chant httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgptpjmdtofk
it goes back to before we had national anthems they arise with the nationalism spread by the example of the french revolution its origin is a song of support for the king when the scots were marching into england it always used to annoy me that the welsh and scots would sing anthems at sporting occasions and the english sang god save the queen we have alternativesi vow to thee my country religious content or jerusalem more religious content or land of hope and glory imperialist content but there is another set of words written but what for the whole the uk a rewrite of hope and glory
we should ditch all lyrics and just have actions much easier all round
you are the queen and i claim my 
err thats because we dont have a king patrick
it is my opinion that the national anthem of france is the most rousing original and enthusiastic nothing else comes close god save the queen is silly and way beyond its best before date and should be replaced god save the queen or king may be gender neutral but it is elitist discriminatory and class distinctive more a sacrosanct chant
imagine if wed had a king for the last  years grauniad would be outraged at how sexist god save the king is
im with you on this i had to read it because the title was so ridiculousi had to see what nonsense had been written quite shocking that there was even a fucking diagram i read some of it considered none of it quickly realised that it was a load of bollocks sorry theyre male parts very different to female parts cos you know there are two genders then was even more surprised that people actually gave a shit one fella sorry again is actually offended by the words god and queen poor bugger he must be a joy to be around
the question was somewhat rhetorical and to suggest that  of the population are idiots makes me think that you fall within the majority
guide her in the nations van whats this about a van and does new zealand really only have the one or is it just one in national ownership
well at least the french have one thing thats better
why does the uk national anthem limits to saving the queen rather than the king as well 
passengers first would be a step up for the italians
at the same time we should find gender neutral terms for nations justice earth ships and cars
i propose changing the welsh national anthem from land of our fathers to land of our single lgbt parents
overthetop and outdated phrases to finish a letter fall in the same category i beg to remain your faithful servant or some such which became yours faithfully
read the several hundred comments above this was sorted hours ago do keep up
bravi very nice guardian and of cultural importance i look forward to the next one comparing numbers of references to someone called god your description of the recent neutralisation not neutering of the austrian anthem was quite correct our lovely previous one by haydn was stolen and pompoused by the krauts there was a certain piquancy after the austrian grand prix last year when the singer a famous vulgar fool in lederhose sang the brothers version instead of the new brothers and sisters he was later quite recalcitrant saying that he sang the version he learnt in school he wont be asked again
spain and italy have the best its a latin thing
as mark twain famously put it in german where is the turnip she is on the tablewhere is the accomplished and beautiful maiden it has gone to the opera
you left o canada off the chart sexistsracistsanticanadianists
this has been discussed to death in comments above please read
god save us all would be far more egalitarian and far more accurate
in a black way you be very careful this is the guardian
brilliant
pleasereallywho cares many people do not know the words to their own national anthem let alone the words to another countrys anthem anthemsto be played at the olympics military parades government functionsyes the sexism of some of these songs really impact people on a real palpable level yeahmortgage is due gas bill is due tuition for the kids is duelike i give a rats ass about whether an anthem is gender biased or not
doesnt work god save the monarch nah doesnt flow at all
not any more im afraid ask any chair
granted its not exactly scotsfriendly but at least the lyrics are more interesting tham the usual god save the queen repeated over and over
since austria has changed its anthem it has gotten a new connotation officially we sing sons and daughters now but a year ago or so a very popular folk singer sang the old version naming only sons by some he was applauded for his decision to stick to the traditional version and the whole feminism and equality debate was once again laughed at so officially it may be neutral but it really isnt some most still find it silly it was changed at all
i find the marseillaise a rather stirring ditty tyranny has massed its legions against usthat an impure blood may sully our soil or something that a nice combination of freedom loving xenophobia
no its a perfect example of how a certain newspaper can make something out of nothing
but where would they find a job i nearly wrote work but stopped myself in time if there were no guardian
it is difficult to think of waltzing matilda as a national anthem
oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand its in the last verse sickening concealment of the patriarchys evil agenda well you learn something new every day i didnt know there was more than the one verse and they drilled it into us at school indeed an evil agenda so pervasive that they hide it in an unsung verse thank goodness for the guardian shining a light on such misdeed
you got a genuine lol from me with that one
nothing good comes of national anthems were all better off without them
you failed to get the question i explain democracy is a way to choose the government what is your primary concern the selection procedure or the result if you prefer the latter then as history demonstrates the best ruler is an enlightened despot like echnaton alexandre cromwell peter the great stalin of mao the reason is simple  of the population are idiots and they will most probably select an idiot like themself
germany is referred to as the fatherland and russia as mother russia a country may be referred to as she a reference to mother earth which brings forth new life i must admit ive never liked the tune which is extremely pondorous or lyrics of our national anthem which should be about the nation as a whole not just the monarch
they have gender because they well have gender what a ridiculously ciruclar argument they have gender for a number of reasons the main ones being a semantic ie directly related to masculine or feminine sex b they fall into a group of words that sound similar or have similar form or c for more or less apparently arbitrary reasons rooted on the history of the language whatever these give words masculine feminine or neuter personalities in some languages words have an inanimate or animate personality as opposed to genderrelated of course there are exceptions where a words gender is based entirely on grammar example mädchen in german because chen is a diminutive whatever the case gender is an integral part of the noun so is part of its personality in the sense that someones physical appearance or tone of voice is part of their personality
never sung it never will lord grant that marshal wade may by thy mighty aid victory bring may he sedition hush and like a torrent rush rebellious scots to crush god save the queen
i dont think hes referring to india or japan as islamic nations its a list islamic nations and india and japan
get away really didnt know that
that would be a liberal opposition party backbencher in the canadian parliament not necessarily a liberal one
intention and context dont be ridiculous its all about interpretation if i possibly can be offended by something you have said then i will be s
okay whichever one of you buggers out there took this spods maths class well need a word about operators i know equality and equivalence can be tricky but really you sodded up these ones
addressing women in the workplace as girl dear love are all power plays in that context utter twaddle is that literally your position in work a power play outside its endearment complete cobblers it can be either or in either environment
utter drivel for goodness sake are you a teenager
well yes admittedly im not sure
yep agreed it concerns me the aggressive tone that presumably mostly men on this thread are using to make sure their points take prominence it amuses me how men so often project their emotive responses on women who are coolly pointing out logical requests just take a quick scroll through the male comments many emotionally reactive closed minded and often projecting their own issues
there was a guy in my class at college the same age as all the other guys and he called them all son
whats that got to do with pensioners the medically challenged whatever that means and fawlty towers demonising people en masse is hardly helpful
wow settle down
i was on a conference call during which my young female colleague thanked a representative from the legal team for their help saying how helpful her girls had been girl is widely used here in cork ireland to address females and my colleague was expressing her appreciation very sincerely yet in this context it seemed inappropriate belittling the contribution of those people although it would certainly not have been the speakers intent i found this article echoed my own unease at the use of girls when addressing or referring to a woman or women
your  year old daughter ranks her junior colleagues breasts im impressed shes got enough juniors to have a score board what i suspect you actually mean is she comments with her friends or family about other peoples physical attributes which is a completely different situation to doing it at work when you are in a situation of power most people do a lot of things in their free time get drunk wander around naked have sex which would be wildly inappropriate in the main lobby of a workplace which is the big difference for someone who claims to be an employment lawyer you seem to have a very shaky grasp of what is considered acceptable for work
no you are
happened to me as well on a railway station in essex my reposte was that i was originally going to say lady but that i doubted that she was one of those either i stomped off before she exploded
maybe you are missing the point
i can only match you two out of three but i do think ill adopt your strategy
they would agree with me theyre sick of this absurd level of political correctness too but then i suspect theyve been around a bit longer than you
problem with these type of articles is they just fuel the pc gone mad brigrade and help them shut down complaints about proper grievences why nitpick when there is real shit to worry about
daily mail and every other rag including this one and just about every other platform
what is
are all power plays in that context what does that mean please show what is the harm
farting in a nutshell is quitr a trick
i agree lots of pointmissing going on below the line on this one
im sending you a big fat kiss my love fuck the pretty people most are exceedingly boring
actually embarrassing
brilliant spot on
i believe h is referring to the influx of bores below the line here this evening who have no doubt been attracted by the clickbaity headline didnt read the article properly and have now contributed a usually very short comment demonstrating their misunderstanding of what feminism is along the lines of get a grip get over yourself love feminists are real fascists etc etc
im offended on the behalf of anyone who isnt offended by not being offended by the things that offend the authoror dont
i get called love mate pal buddy darling sweetheart and even dear in shops and pubs and i am a bloke in my s get over yourself
yes because no woman has ever referred to the men in her life as the boys has she orall the boys in our office thats never once happened nor i hasten to add to add has any women ever sexually objectified any man ever in any at all im sure we were all mistaken for example when the twilight sga was popular and there seemed to be hordes of middle aged women drooling over team jacob or team whatever the fuck the other one was called that never happened nor did they all go weak at the knees when daniel craig first strolled out of the water in casino royal we men must have just imagined it just like we imagine the galactic scale of double standards they seem to apply in the press at the moment
oh good god is there nothing identity politics apologists will stop at to blandardise the world
in cornwall when you stop being a chiel non gender specific youre a boy or a maid for ever always referred to my father as boy and he me or yold bugger cuz brother mcock my robin my beauty all acceptable as is butt or cariad just be careful with dear usually implies a certain waspishness in penwith
i think youll find that quite a lot of these terms are gender neutral thought that would appeal
yes because whistleblowing always goes so well for people in the nhs something if you know uk law you would be sadly familiar with and also as an employment lawyer im guessing youve never working with a doctor before because if you think doctors in training have money kicking around for endless legal fees you are in for a rude surprise as for your claims women in the workplace are almost never harassed i refer you to httpwwwindependentcouknewsukhomenewssexualharassmentworkplacewomenoneinfivelackreportingpoliceresearchopiniumahtml and as for maternity discrimination httpswwwequalityhumanrightscomenmanagingpregnancyandmaternityworkplacepregnancyandmaternitydiscriminationresearchfindings httpwwwbbccouknewsbusiness just because only a fraction of people consult you personally about these problems doesnt mean that people arent experiencing them and just because there is legal redress doesnt mean there are a multitude of barriers preventing people from accessing them from tribunal and legal costs to the fact that you may be reliant on the person you are accusing for a reference
get a life
you can think poorly all you like i think that anyone who tries to make women into perpetual victims hasnt grown up now tell me where women are being held back from speaking their mind at my my work
hmmm
thats the kind of thing shes talking about
although in fairness tv shows are pretty varied and so its not always patronising question time definitelyloose women not really bake off is a pretty casual show where much joviality goes on
crucially of course its all about context it is of course we all see the horrific revelations of men of power exploiting women this isnt a new thing but this kind of language generalisation does not not help the cause it only adds ammunition to those who want to criticise feminism these words can be used inoffensively or offensively entirety dependant upon the context theres an old timer at my work who calls me son irritating but hes an old cockney and its just how he talks and he is unusual ok hes a bit of a dick no its his background and stuff actually the more i think about it he is pretty annoying im my s for christsakes how can i be a son hes ok though so long as youre not in the lift with him for  levels actually i might go to hr what a prick
if you could see the expressions and gestures of the people reading your drivel you would see that most people think you are slightly neurotic
well that was a comprehensive comeback i especially liked the bit where you engaged with the argument and presented an alternative view of things
its everything to do with feelings i may not respect you you may be a horrible person so ill let you know that so who gets to decide what is the correct body language and correct distance for personal space will children be given yard sticks and anyone enters that yard will be sent off for more lesson in personal space the world is diverse humans are diverse celebrate it
heehee this entire thing is just a joke
theresa and philip may alluded to girl jobs and boy jobs that was a wee bit sad my wife and i are quite happy with the restaurant waiters guys
i think thats quite charming
i expect theyre devastated
oh my word what next being offended because i guy waved at you these women that call themselves feminists need to get a grip this is actually embarrassing the guardian please stop giving these women a platform youre part of the problem
what
so called progressive leftwing feminists treat me worse than any conservative men ever did i dont listen to you anymore
i think youre being eminently sensible but there must be occasions for pe or other announcements where you have to say boys or girls for the groupdo you say boys and girls or future leaders and cutie wuties
its not difficult though call the big ones big man and the small ones wee man if in doubt just call them son as that applies to every age of men in glasgow
a feminist mum here who wants my thumbs down vote to count a patronising male boss might diminish some competent female employees by calling them girls but it is ridiculously reductive to extrapolate the argument of this article from that kind of incident i call my year old son lovely short for lovely boy my welsh nans term of endearment i call my  offspring and my predominantly female students guys when asking for a collective headsup we all have idiosyncrasies like this where intention and context is the more important issue start to consider these im sick and tired of halfdigested feminist ideals and ideas being reduced in this idiotic manner by a few selfrighteous selfcongratulatory thoughtless pundits stop it
in a nutshell yes quite why us men werent told this years ago i dont know equality could have been achieved long ago if we knew this crucial bit of information
you are richard littlejohn and i claim my 
ooh i know lad what the young folks on this thread dont know is that ive been dealing with these issues at a professional level since the s and the first wave of socalled womens lib and no one has ever called me out for anything im just sick of this new wave of pokerfaced selfrighteous poseurs no folks not angry just amazed at the social media generations apparent inability to cope with the world without getting their knickers in a twist
i wonder if all your female friends might start to think you a tad sexist if they get to read what youve just blurted out in your post perhaps they dont dare mention sexism to you in case they get on the receiving end of a similar tirade to the one youve posted
noas a swan i find that term noninclusive and invasive of my safe space
what and validate this anachronistic hereditary monarchy republican sponge now
i understand that in finnish there are no gender sensitive pronouns id be interested to know if they ever existed in finnish and if they did what effect their extinction may have had upon literature this may be off the track of the article however im certain that the use of girls ladies guys in addressing our neighbours will not be determinative of our equality though i can understand the irritations that is surely all it is expressed in the article if only on account of the context in which such trems are used
i do know what you mean here but as most of the attack is just him using pet terms to riff off the post it seems basically ok to me if it wasnt in the specific context of this article id feel differently about it
oh dear have people been telling you to piss off again might not just be because youre male that one
clearly youve never travelled to the west country then where everyone is lover or love
im originally from tottenham
if one actually takes the time to read this piece shes making a very wise point addressing women in the workplace as girl dear love are all power plays in that context context is everything is exactly the right balance as is the actual working relationship i say that as a  year old man smart piece and wellwritten thanks
excellent pisstake of daily mail mentality d d d
well your reasoned argument has swayed me why dont you shut up and be respectful
aww satire is harder than it looks isnt it did this sound funnier in your head i bet the ghost of jonathan swift is shitting itself
so everyone should be called guys as in hey guys is that wrong too who the hell knows any more the grauniad seem to have a bee in their bonnet after all this sexual harrassment stuff its not rational it just gets clicks most of the readers of this newspaper are decent human beings most of us know the difference between calling someone love or ducks or whatever its just a term of endearment its not sexist it doesnt belittle its just a turn of phrase its language calling someone love or my lovlie or whatever doesnt make you inherently sexist you can write all the essays you like its a term like in my original point calling a group of people guys even if there arent any actual men in the group it means nothing its just a way to get attention its linguistics not a deep seated problem with the general state of sexism in society grow up get a perspective
i still ostentatiously lay my cloak over puddles but i do it for any gender these days i have only been beaten up twice but i get plenty of shitty comments
wheras arsey darcy can say the boys about craig rh and bruno and thats fine
many parts of the uk call other humans animal nameshen duck chickeneven vegetables me old sprout oh hell ive fell foul of this crappy click bait twice
its got absolutely nothing to do with feelings its about having and showing respect and consideration for others body language is a very important skill for boys and girls to learn girls are usually brought up to be more aware of personal space and boundaries its vital to learn and help prevent the type of boundary breaking behaviour and bullying that has become such a persistent and prevalent problem in schools considering non verbal communication is  tone  and direct verbal only  our expressions gestures and posture are extremely relevant in how we present ourselves and in how we are perceived
in the s we had aids in the s we had mad cows disease in the s we had swine flu and now we haveoffence i believe this offence epidemic can be traced back to  with the creation of twitter the worlds best scientists created safe spaces to try and contain the epidemic but living in those safe spaces made those people more vulnerable to the effects of offence when they leave their safe space and are confronted by billboards tweets or phrases such as hello love that offend them those people now suffer from post traumatic offence disorder and now spend their lives trawling twitter looking for something to give them offence because they cant live without that kick they get from being offended and from taking the moral high ground theres still hope for a cure some experts say dont leave your safe space some experts say we need more safe spaces other experts say just turn off your computer stay safe people because you never know where offence may be lurking
by agreement we were all volunteers all responded to chaps otherwise oi you lot
downgrading disrespectful language as something women need to accept i feel this point is important i know theres some fools already disrespecting and downgrading in the comments theres something about consideration sensitivity connection and kindness that is lost when someone from a prejudiced and disrespectful position assumes what they are saying must be respected and empathy is disregarded
haha has anyone actually called you the last one
exactly this tosh gets published in the paper on a regular basis now idea of life outside of london the part of manchester that im from gorton is full of these terms used by men and women all of the time in fact having just been made to sit through im a celebrity there is a guy on there referring to women there as darlin
you ok hun sorry couldnt resist
me duck a lorange would definitely mess up your day then
if it was a conversation halfdan was pursuing id agree but his post isnt a conversation is it its an attack
is this shit for real
i came on btl with trepidation i say love all the time phew its still okay
read my post sweetheart and youll find that im not being aggressive although youre so pokerfaced you will still interpret this as angry i just find all you others pathetic lighten up sugar plum and get a sense of humour
seriously five thousand words get a grip
bog standard reply im afraidonly a small step up from you ok hun
ah now im mostly in the its ok to say girl camp here but headlines like that are absolutely as patronising as hell and the sun etc should cut it out
oh god weve been invaded by the daily mail pensioners annual outing for the medically challenged the only saving grace is that these old men cant mention the war cos they werent in it and cant write essay replies cos the dm wouldnt allow it
actually the writer is correct everyone should be addressed merely as fellow human so there are no presumptions or slights in terms of their gender or age or anything too personal like their namebut fellow human could offend hardedge vegans so lets call each other fellow mammal but that suggest we are meant to breed and that could offend those who dislike children number of british peopleso how about simply you other entity or for short yo
hit the nail on the head the working class part of manchester that im from is full of these terms coincidentally my wife calls me an arse
so bird is a complete nono then
feminists today are not progressive or leftwing men should just piss off basically you are haters conservative
i get called boss all the time by my boss
in devon honey darling buddy my lover sweetheartits very common and no man bats an eyelid
women eh who knows whatll set them off
im confused
wowjustwow is this what the world is coming to
my goodness you must be fun at a party
all devonians are  years behind the times
the difference is that youre a man you havent grown up subjected to sexism that makes a difference women have and so you have to stop assuming you know everything and dont have to pay any mind to people who have a different life experience from you you just need to shut up and listen and be respectful
pal and mateysince you ask luv
hen simply helps us not to have to say heshe or they whenever we dont know whether the person referred to is male female or other for example a person may marry whoever heshe likes of course han and hon will not go away thats a ridiculous assumption but a common misunderstanding even in neighboring denmark for example its really a storm in a teacup
there are few languages that actually doesnt have a genderspecific pronouns at all i figure they are smart enough to know the difference between male and females anyway 
my sensitivity is ironic i was trying to mimic the culture of personal sensitivity apparently prevalent in sweden now i used to know swedish sea captains who had iron in their souls but now it seems that all you have is cotton wool
my interpretation of this is that it could be used when the gender of someone is truly unknown by the speakerfor instance referring to a person in a crowd as a matter of simple respect not choosing malefemale when one is unsure
they is not denne denne is this den is it
that is in many cases intentional though the norwegian equivalent have decided that it is more important that spoken and written language evolve together then preserving old ways of writing this is why norwegian is a relatively easy language to read an write much more so than english
yes those dictionary people will probably end world hunger tomorrow it they put their minds to it
nope they have it in swedish to but people tend to be touchy about being called it heck ive been almost yelled at for calling someones dog it
considering these intolerants if they really are that way are people who have had to leave their countries because of war and oppression i think that the progressive thing to do is to not let them be killed but i guess thats just me
in more ways than one
wow you might want to desensitize a little if this is enough must be exhausting
slightly different though as the gender neutral pronoun in scandinavian languages actually makes the ending different
in that particular example you have right michaelbulley swedish can use they de there in that case you refer to a not known number of people of not known gender
exactly the same in swedish scandinavian languages are almost identical to english in grammar and sentence building
in the old days in norway at least they were used as a polite form and it would probably feel more weird to bring that back now than using a semi new one
oh boo hoo i didnt realise you suffered so badly at the hands of trans and nonbinary people asking for appropriate social representation it must be so hard for you to put up with them constantly invalidating and belittling your identity through mass societal apathy ridicule and aggression when you just want to be accepted cant they see how much it oppresses you to ask you to use a different pronoun or try to make space for them to feel comfortable in your society im so sorry that theyre just being so mindlessly selfish good luck with your struggle
stop with the dramatics its not being tortured theyve added a new pronoun big whoop
uncultured never drunk yes
im not sure that ones language should be tortured just to suit the whims of a few oversensitive demanding individuals i might fancy being referred to as your most gracious majesty but i wouldnt throw a hissy because people merely said oi you
ok finnish like my own language hungarian which are related to each other neglect to pronounce gender in every word and pronouns unlike german latin languages
they is the plural rd person pronoun originally in english and it started to be used as singular rd without gender restrictions but the p pronoun in swedish is de so hen is a distinct s personal pronoun without gender because its not related to object like it thats den or detso its like if english had a totally new s personal pronoun without gender meaning
male breastfeeding yeah i wouldve left sweden as well
oh boo hoo shall i chop off my penis because it might offend transgendermen who cant have one we have become a world in a perpetual fetal position put on your big boy or hen pants and figure out a bathroom to use instead of disrupting the  of the rest of use with this nonsense
the article didnt suggest that trans folk are unidentifiable it clearly reports that the word hen was used as gender neutral ie to refer to a role that was neither necessarrily male or female such as our move from policeman to police officer and swedens trans community claimed the word to describe themselves i dont think you can claim an unfair editorial bias here
openness to intolerance is not tolerant or progressive
i do not know if i agree with the manner in which transgender people are defined in this article as unidentifiable individuals i would contend that many transgendertransexual people identify completely with the gendersex that the choose for themselves confidently moving away from the pejorative connotations of finding themselves in between genders or as a species of neithernor some transgender people see themselves as nonbinary or genderqueer but many are the complete opposite and conform completely to the normative spectrum of gender that conventional society has constructed for them to fit into or otherwise
make it hän which swedes would probably mispronounce hen though they would pronounce hen hen also where is the logic in that
ah ok i see what you mean strange example though surely if they knew the murderer was a neighbour theyd know their gender anyway i see your point and even though i dont think their is too terrible another possessive adjective would be useful following the swedes example i suggest hes
they
its not daft its illogical if it is about gender which is identity that would be about finding a word or words that somehow dont let someone know your percieve their behaviour to be feminins or masculine if it is about the sex you are born but you dont perform the social norms that society says you should display because of the sex you are born then surely rather than letting societys prejudices off the hook by a neutral word the radical thing would be to celebrate the sex you are even your appearance contradicts it there is a far more serious issue which is for those born intersex and what would be an acceptable form of address for them
you can say both in swedish too personen gråter det måste vara hungrigt however it sounds clumsy and unnatural hen is supposed to be used when you otherwise want to use he or she han eller hon but dont know the gender like he is crying han gråter heshe is crying in swedish from now hen gråterim no expert in english either but i dont think you have the same like hen for you a mix between he and she in english it is for things like det in swedish
we could have shan
because you dont have to be a foreigner to be considered foreign or strange in sweden in sweden there are unwritten rules that people normally stay within and many people find these unpleasant and constrictive but feel socital pressure to conform the unwritten rules state that you are encouraged to do whatever you please as long as its within certain unwritten norms the bracket is just not wide enough to encompass much diversity unless were talking about breaking down gender norms for example beacuse due to this conformism swedish culture has an adolescent streak of trying to break free and be a bit edgy guess frustration due to constrictiveness has to come out somewhere which produces various interesting fads andor experiments last time it was male breastfeeding which was somewhat succesful i suppose since some sort of milk like substance was produced but im not getting involved with that sort of stuff i find british culture significantly more mature and is never perceived as someone trying to break free and shock the establishment because that gets really lame eventually i really dont fit in the other day i was stared at for saying that if my child misbehaved i would tell them off apparently i committed some sort of taboo of course i knew that as i did it but seriously i dont want to join the parents who just dont know how to say no to their child little emperors are raised nurseries and school teachers have trouble and the government is seriously starting courses for parents concerning how to say no to their child its not hard to say no to a child this culture is suffering from some serious constipation
yes it does have other uses than being a a political statement however the gender neutral pronoun was introduced for the very reason of wanting to introduce gender neutrality and because of perceived injustive in the default being he what im saying is that the political statement was in this case a prerequisite for it being introduced at all so you cant really divorce them for this reason its hard to use hen without it being a political statement even though it is of course useful in various instances so i stay clear of using it
in english you can be both singular and plural
i have lived in sweden about two decades and i was welcome everywhere sewdes are friendly and kind i got good jobs and i was respected now i live in northern finland near the border of sweden i can easily visit my swedish friends
we in finland have always had genderneutral pronoun and nothinge else d i like the decision which sweden has made
quite if the writer uses either his or her the reader will make a gender assumption so if the writer and maybe the police is unsure about the gender of the assailant the only option in english is the murderer killed their neighbours wife which sounds terrible
the person is crying it must be hungry
hmm try see you hen youre genderneutral so you are in glasgow sometime
i see what you did there
tip the whiskey down the drain where it belongs and get a whisky you uncultured swine
marge piercy author of the novel woman on the edge of time floated the pronoun per to do the job as in for instance louis and louise were in a contest to see which of them could produce the ugliest photo of perself however like modified spelling thru tho enuf plow getting such newly coined words to catch on is difficult people are quick to resort lazily to the use of access as a verb their poverty of vocabularly keeping them from the use of attain or reach and they wont take the trouble to adopt a neologism that would be useful and would eliminate gender discrimination
christ cant you edit or delete comments on this shitty website
tidy up your english you hypocrite we using they to refer oh dear you cant even e properly yes i missed out the word it as in the use of they has etc
we using they to refer to a singular entity speak for yourself and tidy your english weve been using and has been done so  oh dear
quite right the use of singular they has been used by chaucer eoffrey chaucer edmund spenser william shakespeare jonathan swift daniel defoe frances sheridan oliver goldsmith henry fielding maria edgeworth percy shelley lord byron william makepeace thackeray sir walter scott george eliot mary anne evans charles dickens mrs gaskell anthony trollope john ruskin robert louis stevenson walt whitman george bernard shaw lewis carroll oscar wilde rudyard kipling h g wells f scott fitzgerald edith wharton w h auden lord dunsany george orwell and c s lewis but lets not pretend that precedence actually helps define a language eh dont let anyone tell you you shouldnt use they as a singular ambiguous pronoun they dont have a leg to stand on just whitewashing literary history
there is no such thing as positive racism you are either a beneficiary of racism or a victim of it positive racism still denotes a condescension of others ergo there is no positive or negative racism its just racism
what makes a word correct surely the number of users and how long it has been used for counts for something
similar but not so bad in dutch as it happens although complicated by nouns having only common and neuter genders but the common nouns still being masculine and feminine and needing to be referenced correctly there is no way to known without simply knowing isnt language fun
true but being the liberal nation that sweden as a scandinavian nation wishes to portray itself as im surprised this wasnt addressed earlier i guess it must have something to do with the fact english doesnt really have genders in language so it wasnt restricted as such by grammar
since when was the pet name hen considered derogatory geez some people just want to be offended i wouldnt do it because im not from scotland or the north of england but i am married into a scottish family and the women do refer to other women usually younger than them as hen or pet and ive never seen any such revulsion
every language works in a different way
can a word having been used for six centuries for a certain purpose still be regarded as wrong i doubt it if chaucer and many after him used they as singular and genderless so can we prescriptivists gonna prescribe
really took sweden this long weve been using they to refer to an ambiguous or otherwise genderunspecified individual yes singular since chaucer and has been done so by many well regarded authors and pieces of literature seen as an example of the language of the time only six hundred years behind sweden its ok
we use they in english for this purpose but technically its wrong as its a plural and she and he are singular at some point in the not too distant future it will be considered right nobody objects to using you to as the secondperson singular even though once upon a time people would have used thou
im offended this article is offensive as are you
confusion talking to norwegians henne
the murderer killed his neighbours wifewhat about this i assume the murderer is male and therefore his is used if they were female it would be her
yes the ones norwegian children used to eat on the way to school shortly after ww
ask someone if they can help with my luggage
i have a lot of sympathy i think there is a host of english verbs which were adapted from nouns go and source you are tasked with the list goes on and on especially in organisations like the nhs where saying the same thing differently equates with originality
it might be better to concentrate on improving grammar generally i still hear folk refer to that chairs
it makes sense that someone casually throwing around ableist slurs probably wouldnt appreciate the article
they are better to avoid glasgow then
theres a rather woeful understanding of grammar shown here english has a perfectly acceptable impersonal pronoun it the baby is crying it must be hungry theres nothing impolite or disrespectful about referring to someone as it when its grammatically correct or presumably if thats what they prefer i dont know about swedish but i seem to recall from o level french that there is no impersonal pronoun since all nouns have a gender that might suggest a reason to introduce one but doesnt apply to english ms was obviously invented for similar reasons they is used as third person plural since gender obviously cannot be defined because there may be a mixture its used with anyone or any guest etc for the same reason there is more than one of them
this is retarded
most often you just have to structure the sentence to avoid the necessity altogether eg students submitting their work late will incur
actually to many transgender people it would be offensive to be called hen because that is denying them the right to be referred to as the gender they identify with this should be corrected to say that hen can be used for nonbinary people who feel they are neither man nor woman or a mix of the two who identify outside of the binary
check in time is around   guests wishing to check in earlier may inquire at reception about other possibilities simples
your point is
im not saying that swedish society doesnt try to subvert gender norms its a good thing although in the case of your acquaintance the attempt has been somewhat unsuccessful im just saying that a gender neutral pronoun has many uses besides being a political statement
too many womyn in sweden obviously
presumably their real job is lexicography and they compile the official swedish dictionarythe oxford dictionary does not have the same status but i doubt you would describe those working on it as needing to get a real job
but the use of different pronouns can be seen as social engineering because it enforces segregation apartheid by gender because we then think of men and women as separate species no we think of men and women as separate sexes of the same species which they are
hear hear well said
sweden is quite xenophobic even of those of their own nationality how does that work then
apparently i should tell you to get stuffed httpblogstelegraphcouknewstomchiversscienceifsomeonetellsyousingulartheyiswrongpleasedotellthemtogetstuffed
i cant help but notice that women welcome this change more than men im a cis woman amp i would love a singular pronoun that covers both genders amp folks inbetween just so i dont have to always read through the he or have a car crash of they when she is interacting with another plural group of people
just use the student again might seem a bit superfluous but i think its correct nevertheless students can take out up to  library books at a time usually for four weeks if a student still needs the book after four weeks the student can renew it
enough with the henstrionics
i cant argue with that you could argue about my mangled english at least
great you went to see  doctor then
well thats what you do when someone insists on having an obscure pronoun just call them by name and never by pronoun
i bow to your knowledge of swedish so are you saying that swedish couldnt use dom in the way they is used in my english example above i ask the question as there are some people who say incorrectly that you cant use they in english to refer to one person
and yet you refer to them as them quite easily in your own sentence
one doesnt work it sounds like youre introducing a new element in your discourse and that youre not referring to the previously metionned guest
i will go to the doctor and ask them for advice 
youd be surprised its fashionable for young swedish parents to try to raise their children in a gender neutral way one parent a friend of my workmate was distraught that despite her best efforts at raising her daughter in a gender neutral way she is now in the pink phase everything has to be pink the horror
well i dont know who made this comment shrouded behind an incomprehensible moniker whoever it is its implying that we should use a fairly disrespectful way of referring to other people
yeahbut you cant use domthey when talking about  person
dear german from lyonalready got it covered checkin time is around  if any guest would like to check in earlier one may inquire at reception about other possibilites
omg some people in sweden need to get a real job was going to write more but i am flabbergasted
whether it is incorrect or not it sounds right and thats what language should sound i cant argue with that
dont you mean ask hen for advice 
i used they whether it is incorrect or not it sounds right and thats what language should sound
why would the swedish care about having a pronoun that reminds you of a bird the word for please in german sounds exactly the same as a slang word for penis in french yet they still use it
i blame ikea
so oppeness and tolerance towards people from other cultures is incompatible with a progressive stance on gender politics because im not even sure its true that sweden has a permissive immigration policy also there is a difference between providing a pronoun to use for contexts in which gender is irrelevant or unhelpful and say a planned attempt to eradicate gender from society
the case of french is much trickier than the english one since weve got gendered morphology everywhere the change is much more drastic than replacing pronouns here and there
comments on this thread will close shortly thanks for your contributions
however whats happening these days is perfectly reasonable debate being labelled as sexist or racist some specific examples might be in order here and it also might be best to use the active rather than the passive voice who exactly is labelling perfectly reasonable debate as being sexist or racist when it hasnt been sexist or racist is this the same as anyone who is antisexist or antiracist being called a virtuesignaller member of the liberal elite snowflake etc ive never personally seen anyone being called out on these pages at least for being sexist or racist or whatever unless they actually were being sexist or racist obviously you know better but again please back up your comment with specific examples of when this has happened
i just dont get the whole micro aggression thing in the past feminism was about women being strong and independent now feminism seems to be about women being fragile and weak and need to be protected by some authority how did it get so wrong
well said i find the constant taking of offence where no offence was meant very irritating especially as this usually brings on a spiteful witchhunt against the hapless perpetrator out of all proportion to anything they did
good for america they slaughter each other with guns too should we copy that
yes yes another long winded plea for middle class politeness just like mary whitehouse in the s how banal
benign dictators theyve got a great track recorddo you know that in hitlers germany there werent many complaints at all so he must have been doing something right
and somewhere in the middle are the poor schmucks who accidentally or inadvertently offend another for one reason or another good nice people who wouldnt consciously hurt a fly a bit of slack to them would show tolerance and a generosity of spirit especially if they are more old fashioned than anything else
lol
straight out of 
however so long as they dont breach common english laws of provoking violence or harassment then they should be free to say what they want  but they are inciting hate and hate can lead to harassment and violence besides their views are truly repulsive and while there is no law preventing individuals from having thoroughly unpleasant views and airing them in private they should certainly not be given regular media space to spew their nasty mental contents and pollute social environment
the point is did cumberbatch face any legal consequences for his words no he just got a bit of a bashing on twitter yes but he did feel the need to apologise profusely some might say abjectly for his slip of the tongue might he have been weighing up his future career prospects over responding with something like oh dont be so ridiculously sensitive or well why doesnt the naacp change its name then or even hey i was just trying to help you guys no it was a classic case of identity politics eating itself
interviewed recently at an extremely liberal college supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg was asked in her opinion what was the the most important part of the us constitution without hesitation she replied the st amendment specifically freedom of speech there is no ambiguity in the wording of the amendment congress shall make no laws restricting a citizens right to speak their mind the supreme court has not recognized a hate speech exception to the st amendment and hopefully never will censorship is a slippery slope the sentence congress shall make law is the ultimate restraint against the tyranny of the pc eliteyou may offend or hurt me with your words however i will fight for your right for unfettered speech
i would actually favor i know this will be unpopular state sanctioned media in the short term until the fake news is weeded out quite simply the media cant go on as it does just lying about trump to make him look bad all the time the negativity is diving the country allowing trump some positive press for a year or two may unite the country and be better for everyone
the most nauseating narcissist currently in a position of real power is donald trump who is not remotely liberal
i dont think ive ever seen political discourse as polarized and redundant as it is now its quite depressing but maybe we all have to take responsibility for this we didnt always have social media platforms and to air your views publicly they would have to be reasoned and well articulated or they wouldnt be publishedbroadcast there are swings and roundabouts to all things all social settings tend to be selfmoderating eventually
i really appreciate free speech even if it means reading your incoherent ramblings
did he say that ive searched his post and cant find it
or take issues that are deeply contentious in western society like abortion supporters argue that opponents are evil sexists trying to control women out of religious obsession while opponents argue that supporters are evil murderers who want to kill children out of selfish convenience it is impossible to take a position on issues like that without offending someone now introduce some concept of political correctness either any opinion on abortion is ruled offensive or more likely whoever is the arbiter of political correctness takes a side and uses their offence to silence the other side result the other side is kicked out of politically correct circles altogether and the debate becomes even more polarised because the sides dont talk to one another
just because you have a right to behave badly does that mean you actually should just because you have the right to behave stupid does that mean you actually should
but he does rather superbly capture the nauseating narcissism central to the liberal identity
even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impact nonetheless theyre still very regrettable and provide gratuitous fodder for the cynics student politics are often more of a hindrance than a help to progressive causes
ill happily say it for you the media were acting under the exact same pressures that caused the authorities to consciously bury all those reports in the first place
maryam is also a socialist too so is peter tatchell that is the left that values free speech as opposed to the middle class twittery of the writer of this article
let me get this straightnegative words or stereotypes about women or non white men is bad and harmful to their view of self but regularly saying how evil and privileged straight white men are isnt the same thing what am i missing here
the backlash is politically motivated reactionary ignorant and fetid there you go thats exactly how stupid and unthinking the reaction is to any suggestion that political correctness is anything other than a good thing though the will only get better with time is going a bit far tone it down will you
they noplatformed jermaine greer who is hardly an extremist you dont have to be an extremist to fall foul of these orwellian nutjobs
good point having aliases and avatars certainly doesnt help in this regard
i also tend to see efforts to make language more inclusive as a positive thing what a polite and pc way of saying youd like to shut up those who disagree with you this sort of doublespeak is truly terrifying
i said it depends no you didnt
not yet but i can see the day coming
this was such a disgusting scandal that it got global coverage in fact more coverage in other countries than this one one wonders why
so thats a yes then
id agree wealth is definitely a big marker of privilege as someone who is not struggling i obey the rules id set out above for example im more likely to make derogatory jokes about rich people than about people from a poorer background but as a white male i dont think i have the experience to say how much racismsexism holds other people back vs their class group but it sounds plausible
how is my suggestion a strawperson the altright intentionally mischaracterizing protest as antifreespeech is the real lie my concern and amazement is in how unprepared the left seems to be in dealing with this level of animosity and cloaked aggression a recent example would be sebastian gorka was interviewed on npr his contempt for the interviewer and by extension anyone who disagreed with him was shocking and he behaved like an ass and yet the interviewer was so overly cautious and polite missing an opportunity to just say youre behaving like an ass and many people in the trump camp seem to relish being assholes without that level of common sense and directness were going to keep losing sight of whats important in the free speech argument
you know its called the slippert slope fallacy right its only a fallacy when the existence of a slippery slope is asserted without evidence or valid reasoning eg gay marriage will inevitably lead to incest and bestiality
free speech and direct and indirect discrimination are  different legal concepts you have committed a basic category error
true and there are scores of groups who are offended by each other
well youre clearly looking down on whoever it is you think youre looking down on so the sarcasm would seem to be superfluous
well people feeling offended by the words and actions of others is a natural consequence of having communities with very different views and beliefs in one small country for example put an indian hindu in the same room as a pakistani and a bangladeshi and whoever speaks first will offend the other two unavoidable their cultures have these prejudices built into them
like i said the world owes you nothing there will be ppl who call you every name in the book the quicker you accept this fact the better you can deal with any situation
they are so used to shouting people down that have become completely incapable of changing peoples opinions with open debate this though i think its partly because they dont have the arguments to debate given the paucity of the underpinnings of the ideology
superb
its hard to keep a sense of humour at the sight of that awful woman
the same sort of bits we ignore in the bible the devil will e scripture to his own purpose this happens with all charlatans and demagogues wishing to lead people to serve their own selfish ends
without the freedom to feel offended on behalf of other people how can i possibly hold the moral high ground and holding the moral high ground gives me a feeling of being elevated empowered where i look down on others i like looking down on others that feeling that warm glow of being better than you
you will never get a successful productive and vibrant society where religion any religion is protected from criticism or humor that is the real offense of pc being afraid to criticize 
you may think that you just wrote something benign and balanced but you didnt i wouldnt be in principle opposed to censorship of speech whose sole purpose is to be offensive and who is to decide the intent you realise that all satire from swift to the present day would be banned under such a rule the increasing willingness of the west and particularly the left to entertain this idea is terrifying
very well stated
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged you know theres many offensive things that can be said about that demographic of people right in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls not everyone who disagrees with your opinion is a juvenile internet troll not every politician who disagrees with you is rightleaning for example leftleaning liberals definitely disagree with your position
completely
offence is taken often taken purely as a political imperative to for example you are a twit but i dont at this point know if you will be offended you analyse the comment and choose offence or otherwise offence is just a fashionable way of trying to shoehorn cry baby emotionalism into political theory
it doesnt necessarily but it does make it harder to understand what people are saying sometimes good grammar is the difference between knowing your shit and knowing youre shit
oh come on obama was and is american to think or even entertain the idea that he isnt is conspiracy theory nuts joe arpaio is hardly a reputable source trump claimed consistently that he had investigators who had unearthed evidence in hawaii that obama wasnt american this was and is a lie a bare faced flat out lie
enjoy your bubble
none of which has any bearing upon the degree of offence taken as im sure some religious adherents would tell you either nobody has the right to not be offended or we all do
the koran is islamthe word of the prophet so which bits can you ignore
i dont do wank mags pet if youve got a link to a reputable site feel free to post and i love how you think that milos should be banned for being rude then use mental health bigotry as an ad hom ha ha haoooh the rank smell of hypocrisy stinks to high heaven
so many people want the lttrumpexitgt event to be the final contest between darkness and light even if the facts suggest otherwise did you forget clinton got more votes than trump did you forget the brexit result was  not really a tsunami of the oppressed swamping a tiny selfinterested cabal of insiders but hey you enjoy your fantasy we all need them
you just dont want to think about it i said it depends
hate speech has to be aimed at an individual calling for the nuking of the middle east is not hate speech the middle east is not an individual or group
youre not wrong im usually fairly careful with factchecking but this time was a slipup especially with no edit function it is impossible to unring the bell or fix typos
if you disagree with an idea disprove and debate it being a woman or born with brown skin are not ideas theres nothing to disprove or debate its just a matter of fact that people are born women andor with brown skin and it should be sanctioned whenever someone uses these facts as a basis for dishing out offense without purpose the independent runs an article today about how massive constant and offensive the sexual harassment of young women often are even in britain in broad daylight anytime anywhere it can cripple a persons quality of life if you are constantly bombarded by offensive behavior due to how you are born again there is nothing to disprove or debate its just offense for the sake of dominating other people who happens to walk on the same street as you i recommend hefty fines and compensation to the victims when in a public place you are liable for your bad behavior having a negative effect on other peoples quality of life if you dont think you can control yourself stay at home
i like how you come across totally sane and reasonable while responding to people who disagree with you but next time just leave out the part how you couldnt read an article because naked women were popping up from everywhere just stick your fingers in your ears and go lalala cant here you itll make for an even better effect
you cant claim you are the majority and also are oppressed those  things do not go together just to be a pedant those categories are not mutually exclusive there are plenty of examples of minorities oppressing majorities ruling tutsi minority in pregenocide rwanda any brutal or totalitarian dictatorship where a small inner cabal oppresses an entire population im not saying the other commenter is correct and you are incorrect but you cant put this point forward as selfevidently true
i have not heard of her i will check her out thanks for the suggestion
didnt say it was i was highlighting the arbitrary nature of the policing some days a comment is removed before anyone has seen it the following day you can report a very similar comment half a dozen times and yet it remains it is also very often the case that there is almost no reference to the forum rules as to what is removed it just vanishes
seems pretty obvious to me yet you still cant get it i fear making you understand would take up far too much of my time continue living in ignorance
youre right the apostrophes in this instance dont devalue the argument it does that irrespective of bad punctuation in reference to the point its not about imposing a morality police its merely incumbent on people to be responsible for their words and deeds and to pose and phrase arguments in a way that doesnt cause unnecessary undue or gratuitous offence free speech is about holding the powerful to account not to abuse and marginalise minorities and this is not about limiting the rights of rich white men but just acting responsibly towards all people if ones agenda is exploitative of the positions of others then it should be called out as such this whole snowflake nonsense needs to stop were all human even this milo guy looks like he could do with a safe zone these days bless
wrong target then the liberal left are not all journalists they are more likey to work in the public sector be educators social workers researchers and so on think youre a bit out of date id say their careers are a lot more diverse than the stereotypical view youve outlined here theyre more likely to be despised because of their self righteousness in my view
also i cant edit previous reply to you the arizona legislature passed a bill in  that would have required obama and other presidential candidates to prove they were us citizens before their names could appear on the ballot it was vetoed by the gop governor thus the sheriff dug into it all no actual paper birth certificate has ever been presented only a microfiche image which apparently has the wrong markings amp other inconsistencies i down care either way im british but thats the facts
if you cant understand this youve had a very privileged existence which might have made you exceedingly naive and not a little callous what were you saying about unwarranted hostility again would you accept a suggestion that your inability to understand why your accusation of a privileged existence could provoke hostility indicates your own privilege naiveté or callousness qualifying it with a might doesnt really lessen its impact does it you should know that failing to agree with your opinion is not the same as failing or being unable to understand it that does seem to be a mistake often made btl on cif
not even the hippocratic oath can guarantee freedom from harm the problem we face here is that different people have different thresholds for feeling offended disliking humour and engaging in fulsome debate at it worst i think we have a situation in which the two sides simply cannot have any dialogue since one uses rudeness and the other censorship to shut the other up
i dont think there is any automatic right to offend as offensiveness cannot in any sense be considered a desirable end in itself however what i would defend is speech that incidentally offends while serving some legitimate purpose we might ask ourselves where we draw the line on what counts as a legitimate purpose political debate obviously yes but some types of comedy in any case there is a responsibility on the speaker to check if the same purpose could be served equally effectively without causing offence though i wouldnt punish minor infringements of this kind thus i wouldnt be in principle opposed to censorship of speech whose sole purpose is to be offensive eg a stream of racial insults that does not mean that its a freeforall for anyone to remove the offensiveness by any means necessary there must be rules laws agreed standards of behaviour eg heckling is permitted in some forums but not in others on this reasoning i wouldnt see any contradiction in wanting to see charlie hebdo closed down while thoroughly condemning the assassins imagine if instead of charlie hebdo it had been a committee meeting of the front national
we all have a right to speak about a service we use one might complain the bus is late that doesnt mean we dont have a right to use it words have now power without some form of context words alone cannot harm i dont think those that want free speech are saying they dont want their speech to be questioned thats the whole point its better to have speech that can be challenged than for it be be silenced however whats happening these days is perfectly reasonable debate being labelled as sexist or racist
this is a man who pretended lied that he had proof the previous president wasnt american and was therefore ineligible for the office in all fairness this was down to maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio in arizona hes presented the evidence still not resolved look it up and make your own mind up maybe
you are a russian agent paid to promote antidemocratic ideas in western media to make russia appear more normal thats the best explanation i have got for your truly alarming remarks
gender race skin color are not choices humans can make thats the way we are born political and religious affiliations arewe can chose not to display sympathies with ideologies and religions we can chose not to be adherents of these thats the difference
of course its no little irony that milo has met the same fate as that he has encouraged for others what it does show up is the amount of inconsistency or hypocrisy by those who claim high minded principles indeed
if we no platform anybody who might discuss things that others could find offensive we would be unable to have any debate on religion as what is sacred for one person could be blasphemy to another or homosexuality some extremely religious people could find it offensive womens rights could not be discussed some feminists have attitudes that are offensive to men while mens rights activists can be offensive to most people a modern democracy allows for free debate and for people to present their views freely for them to be challenged it is often those who call for a viewpoint to be no platformed who are unable to challenge that viewpoint in debate
i can value an argument to the max without worrying about apostrophes bad punctuation doesnt devalue the argument
im a big fan of karen straughan girlwriteswhat
no the rationale behind opposition to political correctness is that people are abusing the principle to shut down opinions they dont agree with by labelling them racisthomophobicsexist i agree but unfortunately the election of the global village idiot to the whitehouse and the lies of the leave campaign have allowed or even encouraged deep seated prejudices and hatred to be normalised dangerous timestimes indeed
no its not an equivalent at all maybe try reading and responding in an intelligent way to my comment if you disagree with the points im making just a suggestion
no single droplet causes the flood but throwaway jokes and comments microaggressions in the much derided parlance of social justice activism add up to a climate of hostility that makes life significantly harder for members of targeted groups its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged for any idea position to have credibility it needs to be consistent this is the problem with the liberal narrative its completely inconsistent and people know it the author cant even recognize her own hypocrisy within the space of one paragraph
yep there are some other interesting examples online that would have you smacking your head on the table they are so bigoted
meanwhile those who rail against what they say is political correctness and imagine all these evil lefties around who are stopping them from saying what they want to say who are these imaginary people youre obviously not familiar with whats going on on university campuses particularly in america
and also micro denotes very small thus hard to observe therefore in language terms it should not be harmful furthermore it of course sets up nicely for an elite of philosopher kings to find the microaggression and give explanation of it because only they are capable of divining such meanings
you dont harm people with speech this is where it gets tricky you absolutely can hurt people with speech sticks and stones is a bad policy especially in the world with cyberbullying but this is really limited to speech directed personally rather than in general the way to deal with that is harassment law not limiting free speech though
if you let them
i think any sensible advocate of free speech has always said that there should be an exception for incitement to violence and defamation other than that i believe anything is fair game at what point would we want to curtail hitlers right to free speech were he or someone like him to try the same things again at no point history has taught us that seeking to suppress points of view will eventually backfire i notice you mentioned milo if people would just let him speak people would soon lose interest in him put it this way do you think milo was disappointed about what happened at berkeley
we know that blacks are not more stupid but thanks for the slur anyway we when i criticize veryumble why do you feel offended are you in some kind of a club together anyway i agree with some of your points with others not so much but everything you said i find perfectly debatable because you provide context more explicitly social context because what else is a question of culture than a question of society and how it deals with its own history and indeed african americans are part of this society not just its passive object thats a world of difference to throwing around a fact about which ethnic group does better leaving it up to the imagination of the reader whether that would be down to social interactions or of because of genes and nature asserting itself and what doing better is even supposed to mean exactly
i do wonder what it is all you people just arent allowed to say whatever it is you seem very scared people might take offence
essex
true although this isnt an academic paper true but its not too much to expect such a referencelink otherwise the sentence in question is little more than as we all know its also not just the idea that it might be happening that is in question its the conclusion that it is down to sexism or reveals sexist attitudes towards women that is in doubt  words variably popular words out of  ish is not indicative of sexism being at the heart of the language then we have to consider why there was a change for a particular word courtesan for example is it possible that the change in meaning came about due to the presence either increased or more acknowledged of high class socially schooled prostitutes in the courts there are other reasons with might see such a process in action more often for women that would not be attributable to sexism towards women that is it appears more acceptable to insult men directly while the same is not true of women historical context and considering what is acceptable in polite society so instead of direct insults women get insinuations and veiled comments about their character one contemporary piece of research that might be said to support this is the increased tendency for men to suffer personal abuse online as seen in this pew report
listen to women talking about men
science men engineering men art men philanthropy men socialism men exploration men philosophy men logistics men governments men naturally women do all these things now but the same could be said for your list of ills of the world if you blame everything bad on men then you have to attribute everything good to them too
words cannot be sexist or bigoted in themselves i was in lidl yesterday and they were selling boxes of faggots back in the s if you were gay you had a happy disposition so things have different meanings in different countries or at different times get over it
apparently it has been used in this sense since 
why would you use spinster in its original form or are you referring to the later legal definition
i havent asserted anything particularly strongly i have not done an indepth comparative study i think the thesis is possible it does not sound that crazy to me
personal insecurities is why sad but true wiggles pinky
dont crow
canute tried a similar thing as did the dictionary compilers who excluded the word fuck between  and  and how marvelously successful that was
i suspect he meant pop off as a euphemism for breaking wind but hey maybe thats just me
great minds 
eight more words roughly half the commentators havent understood the article
and how do you propose to deal with it
in which case you would deprive yourself of a vivid way of describing for example an over enthusiastic fascist if you try a little search for the expression rabid fascist youll soon see how it works
all the words in this article have been downgraded over time to refer to women as inferior to men especially in terms of low status andor low morals the words you list are certainly not compliments but none of them make men sound inferior to women only possibly to other men how about providing an example of a word that makes men sound inferior to women
the use of rabid feminist is not misogyny it is a valid description of a certain type of feminist misogynist itself is frequently used as a derogatory gendered slur by rabid feminists
male insecurity lies at the heart of misogyny sure what has that got to do with the article
yep as the old saying goes if youre stuck on a railroad track in front of an oncoming train and cant move just close your eyeswhat you cant see cant hurt you
 pigeon fancier
not really never heard bitch for a man although ive heard talk of men who are bitchy slag for a man sounds very cockney to me never heard it outside television you must be a gfeminist they too think that their experiences and thinking are the only possible definitive ones
exactly just demonstrating the sexism behind the thinking in the article and teh stance it supports
if you havent come across expressions consisting of rabid some kind of human you probably arent as familiar with the possibilities of the english language as you ought to be try rabid fascist communist tory for example
no one is seeking to control the language congratulations to you and to hordes of others contributing today for completely failing to comprehend the article before posting that they disagree with how you comprehend the article does not necessarily mean they have done so further your references to leftists and pc appear to reflect only an imaginary version of what constitutes a leftist one that doesnt exist in real life but only in the pages of propagandist media like the dm which are aimed squarely at the fearful and the ignorant your comment is proof that it is wrong
really have you got a link for that if youre right id be surprised if it caught on there must be at least three living generations of people who know what it really means
if this was actually done academically it wouldnt only be about words that are derogatory or sexist to women this may be true but nor have i said it was my point was that academic studies will show more detail than casual reading having said that there are many academic papers dealing with feminism so you havent convinced me in the same way that you overlook that he may be wrong or biased at least the latter indicated by the sexist focus of his research and article in the same way that you overlook that he may be wrong or biased at least also true to a point i have seen a great deal of material about unconscious prejudice and discrimination on the grounds of race sex religion and sexual orientation at times i have experienced it the oscars have accepted the truth of it the macpherson report was explicit about it there have been numerous reports of this or that organisation taking steps to overcome it all in all for me at least the evidence is very strong that it exists in the wild i dont know which we you are referring to it is a part of speech in france it would on in germany man in context it means that it is a view that is widely held we indicates that i consider myself to be part of that group  not an attitude of anyone i know and of few people ive met really ok i have seen it a lot in schools in offices even here btl i have been accused of being arrogant for saying by most peoples standards i am well informed on this particular topic explaining why and how common expressions like no likes a smart alec add weight to the belief  its not a rule well there are always exceptions to the rule is another figure of speech intended to signal that what has been said is not a universal truth your mileage may vary is another one that says much the same thing would you like to add anything else
it doesnt take any intellectual gymnastics to understand feminism once understood youd be a pretty terrible person not to agree with its aims given that this is the case it surprises me that so many people pour scorn on it this is a very good article detailing a very evident example of how sexism is revealed through languageits not difficult to understandit really isntwhich camp do you guys fall into are you thick or terrible
wanker tosser plonker prat bastard there are loads of pejoratives than can only be used for men so whatt the point
but mustache is feminine those crazy french moustaches on men are optional 
why do some people make any feminist analysis of anything into a personal attack on all men maybe because it is patriarchy is the spurious view that all men have power over all women and as a result have abused that power to oppress and victimise women thus entitling all women to greater and greater unearned rights and privileges maybe a lot of people are fed up with the bs metanarrative
why is it nonsense please explain
not at all what the article says why do some people make any feminist analysis of anything into a personal attack on all men
classic antifeminist distraction look those guys over there are even more sexist than us so why are you hassling us when you could be picking on them no this is an english speaking newspaper most of us primarily speak english lets deal with our own issues of sexism in our own language
i think shed be the governor
what a load of utter nonsense 
this is an interesting and well researched article on the evolution of language every time we attempt to choose words with a less derogatory context their meaning subtly changes think of the ways special and challenged are often used nowas for bachelor the word might sound alright on its own but what about confirmed bachelor
ifonlyifonly yes but the point is that these words never had a respectable meaning they sprang into being fully formed as terms of denigration
but seriously even this argument about rabid feminist isnt even about removing words from the dictionary or redefining them you may think that but others differ the actual result of the complaint was it has since apologised for the flippant response and is reviewing the example sentence which may well result in its removal for an easier life with respect to a hysterical depiction heres emers depiction of the appearance of rabid halfway down the list of examples the example rabid feminist is possible because of its relationship to our form of life a life in which women are caricatured as shrill bossy and nagging and caring about womens rights is extreme and fanatical which is patently both hysterical and just plain wrong political correctness can indeed go mad but on the other hand the fact we no longer feel its ok to describe people as poofters ners and so on has to some degree been part of a remaking of a slightly more tolerant society yet some and many here atl and btl still feel its ok to describe people as racist misogynist islamophobe is exactly the same derogatory manner that is the problem when those word you cited were are used much of it done so to police speech and to shut down dissent or debate that is not a move to a more tolerant society one can argue about causation and about how far to take this but on a basic level i think care with language is just about manners and respectblockegt i agree which is why some aspects of feminism sadly loud and with a platform are a major issue there was no manners and respect in the approach to tim hunt or matt taylor or towards males in most of the feminist articles here but some of the responses btl have been kneejerk nonsense about thoughtcrime and so on thats more what i am responding to this attitude just demonstrates that you either dont read the articles which elicit these responses or far worse actually agree with them kneejerk nonsense is a good description for many of those not the responses the reason its a bit unfortunate is that it is in common derogatory usage now and there probably wasnt a real need to include it to define the usage its in common usage because it is a very apt description for the type of feminist that writes the articles that generate the responses you feel are kneejerk for example the type of feminist that really thinks that a teacher having a sexual relationship with a pupil varies in severity depending on gender complaining about a lack of editorially neutral choices elsewhere is just hypocrisy especially in this example which is editorially neutral given that it validly describes a type of feminist
queen and lady for example have gone in the opposite direction acquired higher status
a few years ago i met an australian woman who used the word tart referring to a man
grammatical gender and gender as we see it in english are two different things whilst there are links most words referring to males and females are masculine and feminine respectively its more to do with word formation than actually saying they are male and female there are many words which dont match their stereotypical gender in french moustache is feminine as byrnelegacy pointed out as is beard car and van as well as their version of the slang word dick on the other hand vagina breast and cervix are masculine
the muslims who get a taste of western education find it far easier to launch attacks on modernity than to reform islamsunnis and shia at each others throats but the most important thing is to check out some word origins from english trying to establish false equivalency pathetic
you did a lot of fawning but you did not write one word about why you liked the article
i wonder if maybe there are signs of sexism in arabic and islam maybe start your research in saudi arabia and when you have that situation under control we can discuss the english language
you obviously have very strong feelings about this i am not whining i am actually really curious as to why you and the guardian deem the word so bad
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language thats the headline logically you can infer that the english language is sexist i dont agree and i have explained why
there is no sexism at the heart of the english language language reflects culture which is where youll find the sexism to be fair david shariatmadari points this out quite clearly and is yet another guardian writer who has been illserved by an attentiongrabbing headline
just wanted to say that as a guardian member i really do appreciate this kind of article i normally make a point of avoiding the comment section on any article about feminism because of the sheer volume of vitriol every time there is an article about it but maybe if we dont comment as well you wont realise that there is a quiet but appreciative reader base thank you for the article please keep them coming
but mustache is feminine those crazy french
every one of them is trapped within the same inevitable journey of entropy everything tends to destruction given that is the case all we are doing is prolonging the inevitable if we slow down the destruction so you are on a plane it develops a fault it is going to crash nothing can save you you know and everybody else knows death is inevitable nothing can save you you have a choice the plane can crash into a mountain killing everybody instantly or the plane can continue for another five minutes with everybody screaming in terror losing bits along the way with terrified passengers sucked out of the torn cabin of the plane into the void and when the plane crashes the impact does not kill you you lie in the wreckage every bone broken and with a fire inching towards you which will burn you to death in extended agonywhich would you prefer the mountain or the flames the planet will die one day why not have a good time now rather than drag it out for the generations who have never been born and will know nothing if never born
how about mangina
all men to cease speaking forthwithin future we will be permitted only to say the word yes when accepting blame or paying for shopping
holistically you should thank all the contributors of course we are all thinking within the same holistic thought box
the stay at home dad i meant if u cannot nurse and breastfeed cannot out earn and support your partner who can cannot provide any maternal instincts which all mammal mothers are blessed with oxytocin and so on and so forth what bloody use are you
the ills of the world are not due only to the men of the world religion malerun malecreated designed to hate women wars men dictators men corporations mainly men rape as a weapon of war men governments mainly men yep i would say the ills of the world are due to men and their egos they cant get women to do what they want and they cant handle it
see my answer below re sensitive and queer look at the list of words the author cites how often are the words courtesan wench spinster and madam used in the modern world we might say shes a little madam but we mean by this a female who is insufferably demanding the male form would be an obnoxious twat which is more pejorative we could talk about the c word that rhymes so appropriately with our health security how often is that word applied to a female in her entirety nothing wrong with the old english word and as a heterosexual male i quite like the part of the body it describes but when applied to a male it is utterly pejorative is it not
thats right fool blame the women for the systematic rape of children accept this fate what makes you think they accept it they are to blame are they even though they have zero rights why am i even responding to you
does it king hasnt become a derogatory term queen may be a derogatory term when used about a man depending on how its taken as it can also be a selfidentifier but that would mildly support the thesis rather than contradicting it
httptalkingprettycomwpcontentuploadsbeckhamjpg i know i feel dirty too
horrible everyone must stop using english from now on after all we dont want to be misogynists do we this is the only solution and well have to apologize for using the language for so long god forbid we find some words that demean men as well then well have to start apologizing all over again
queen would certainly be one how about queer shes a little queer suggests a slightly quirky female hes a little queer has a far bigger barb to it how about sensitive a sensitive female is emotionally empathetic a sensitive male is irrationally defensive i e the example of ponce a word that would never be applied to a female homemaker and derived from the word pounce men pounce on financially affluent women therefore isnt that pejorative what about a good catch turning a good husband into a form of prey
policing by whom the feminists or the antifeminists who seek to undermine feminism by associating it with pejorative adjectives such as rabid it was one of a list of examples and not even at the top so the article suggesting it be removed as if it was the only item on the list is exactly the type of policing being referred to can you point to some evidence of antifeminists trying to insert the word into dictionaries with respect to describing some bits of feminism as rabid its a perfectly valid description for some bits of it which patently deserve pejorative descriptions and to be undermined i think the great majority of this policing you speak of is done by the latter group and this is where the usage comes from the entire feminist stance here is trying to police attitudes to males mainly in pejorative terms which is unexpected as massive hypocrisy is another facet of that type of feminism
i dont think english has much to worry about after all nonenglish languages are far more sexist in french for example both bedroom and kitchen are feminine whilst garage and screwdriver are masculine
i find it somewhat patronising someone of eastern descent lecturing the english on sexism india in particular is a disgusting example of female oppression and the rest of the middle east is an object lesson on how to denigrate and marginalise  of the population nothing that happens in britain comes anywhere close to the kinds of behaviour we witness in other parts of the world why doesnt he pick on india and really have a go at them thin news day
lol now i cant get the phrase use you loafess out of my head wonder if that would involve using a slice of common sense
the etymology of queen neatly contradicts this thesis
the language lives some words change meaning over time have the achievements of the feminist movement percolated down through the many layers of our language experience suggests that it is happening i am accustomed to seeing gender neutral words like chair to describe a person who chairs a meeting and the once male specific word actor now applying to thespians of either sex
i think both have the same meaning when i applied to men the point is if you played word association saying say either man or woman after each word the word woman would follow each of those i suggest why are there more wittering women than men frigid women than men tiresome women than men brainless women than men good time gals than good time guys speaking as a married man
i thought it waswhy do police patrol in threes one who can read one who can write amp one to look after the two inteelectuals
there is nothing faux about feminists and were far from dead at least not while able to write our exhaustion from objectifying ourselves to become the object of someone who doesnt love or know yous object of desire yuck victoria secret model said she quit her job when she realised they groomed her to turn on men that turned her off
followed by glances that inform the subject what a sexist was groomed in the man voyeuring us its creepy to be the subject knowing the leering groomed to become a sexist standard pig through porn of the day means the buck stops there
isnt this exactly what winston smith was doing in 
ridiculous equivocation equal in political power social worth economic opportunity is what is meant as you know not identical in the uk women have all those things in fact in education they are more equal and have been for some time for some reason many supporters of equality fail to push for addressing that
true although this isnt an academic paper and i find it interesting that among all the huffing and puffing below the line noone seems to be able to come up with a good counterexample which would be a matched pair of male and female words where only the male version has become more derogatory over time
british english is always dived for past tense of dive dove is american
just as words evolve so do their meanings yes and thats what the article is about any perceived outrage may be in the overblown headline rather than the actual article
he explicitly acknowledges that usage as the previous comments e shows so maybe you need to think about who the idiot is here
as are antracism antihomophobia and feminism feminism is not the antithesis of sexism its sexist to think it is
the article describes usage it doesnt claim anything can or should be done and it explicitly acknowledges that the sexism is in society not the language which would rule out the idea of changing language to change behaviour from the start or didnt you read it
no it doesnt say that its considering changing one out of eight sample phrases used
would you like to point out who in any article on this subject has called for any words to be banned
i am sure this is truei would expect someone who studies a subject to see more than the casual observer that is how academics work if this was actually done academically it wouldnt only be about words that are derogatory or sexist to women having said what you said an approach that is often intended to be derogatory you overlook that he might be right to see it in the same way that you overlook that he may be wrong or biased at least the latter indicated by the sexist focus of his research and article we still have a tendency to dislike clever people or people who study at certain times although there are always exceptions to the rule i dont know which we you are referring to but its not an attitude of anyone i know and of few people ive met its not a rule
straight out of the you are a dick if you have one school of fauxfeminist thought
isi isnt just men the fundamental women are also raising their daughters to accept this fate and their sons to die for the cause it gives them power and they enjoy it every bit as much as the men the ills of the world are not due only to the men of the world by your warped logic all the good in the world is only due to men as well
so so vacuous
another thing in regard to editing things out of context why havent the two guardian articles reported the dictionarys use of the term rabid feminist in the context of a e from a feminist author and as one of nine usage examples
its astonishing how many people fail to understand this and keep coming up with derogatory male words as though they are brilliant proof that the article is wrong
its really not an article criticising language in fact he goes out of his way to point out it isnt the language that is sexist the language just reflects sexism in society
is there a female equivalent of these words which didnt become derogatory if not it isnt a good counterexample to the ones given
there are countless words which have pejorative overtones that are wholly or mainly applied to men bastard today is rarely used to mean an illegitimate child but instead means an unpleasant man cuckold means a man whose partner is adulterous usually behind his back there is a female equivalent of the word but it is virtually unknown which means that these arent great counterexamples to words where the male word is still in use with a respectable meaning while the female version has become derogatory id be interested to know if anyone can think of good examples of that rather than some of the weak arguments being made against the article btl
collocates with rabbit
thought control if you remove the word from society make is unacceptable to say their belief is that this will change thought their ideology comes before reality all the books that have words are to be burned
taking it like a woman is ann oakleys book all about her life yes i know i dont know whether rabid has a negative connotation or not in this context or whether she is knowingly deliberately using it to appropriate it and you dont know if theres any negative connotation or not in the context of the dictionary or whether they are just using it as an example the point is that using the term rabid feminist doesnt automatically make you antifeminist i find oxford dictionaries choice of a e from a book written in  as an example of current usage very odd to say the least was it supposed to be recent was it significantly less recent than all of the other eight examples
i like to be able to define the words all by myself so i can use them to tell others whats different im now defining black to be whitelike as my ideology hates racism ive asked the local council to paint all new zebra crossings white whitelike white whitelike the end result is the same as previous zebra crossings but im sure the painter will understand our need to be racially sensitive when using words as i now own the word whitelike and have banned any use of the word black ive taken a massive step to eradicate racism
i love that youre trying to correct someone elses post for being presumptuous thanks for the feedback but thats not what i was trying to say
is that naughty naughty english language letting itself be see to communicate experiences ideas and concepts ill give it a stern talking to you go and have a nice lie down
and the examples chosen are quite selective in contrast consider how behaviour that we are supposed to laud as assertive in a female would simply lead to a man being called an arsehole and it is interesting how arsehole would almost exclusively be applied to a man despite the fact that we all have them there are are number of other words that would appear unisex that are almost always applied to males jerk etc it illustrates the perception of men in our society
i mean the one before dictionary
i think mo is talking about the second its
i get hurt by the use of would of thought instead of would have thought
theres also bastard an old term for either sex for a baby born our of wedlock it is now aimed at men who are seen as unfeeling mean or without conscience
im so sorry i irritated you then ill go and stand in a shop window and pretend to be a personnequin
i believe the word feminist is misappropriated to do that work
you total oafess
the dictionary that the guardian would have us all adopt would make george orwell blushmore like cause orwell to strut and say he was right the left wants so many words banned they wont even be able to use hand signals
when the word rabid nagging grating and shrill are used i think of australian politicians the rabid pyne leader of the house the nagging leader of the opposition the grating sound of tony abbotts fingers dragging along the floor the shrill and scarey voice of the foreign minister not because we think she is a woman but those eyes bloody scarey
because some see feminismempowering of women as the biggest threat to their existence
and that is exactly why it s done by misogynists and why it is so common the implication of course being insane angry bitch foaming at the mouththe connotation is very deliberate
how many of those outside australia do you think know what a gallah is
rabid was usually associated with dogs as in dogs infected with rabieslinking that word to feminists is pretty low
traditionally a governess was employed to teach the children of the upper classaristocracy so was not at all the same as the modern nanny or au pair except in the us where only the upper class can afford such a luxury
there is a difference in usage from calling somebody an old dog to calling somebody an old bitch
everything about us is so vile
well said lonleveler
the reason is that their voices are higher on average and part of shrillness is higher pitch it would be pretty hard for andre the giant to sound shrill and that isnt sexism equally there are negative words associated with the male voice gravelly gruff growling rough
pop went the bottle
was going to ask what the fuck are you smoking in order to come out with such bullshit then i realised that would be a complete dog act so ill let it slide
well said robertaussie
the presumably is far more deserving of the emphasis youve presumptuously given the because
but it says that the dictionary has changed its description for rabid so is obviously under pressure to be crowd pleasing rather than a realistic portrayal of word usage
so did i
always good to see poes law in action
i think it means a bundle of firewoodas seen on the cover of led zeppilin ivthe wood not the old bloke carrying it a bouquet garni was sometimes described as a faggot of herbs
in all fairness this is not new perhaps youve heard of thomas bowdler
i dont see that the one precludes the other it is an interesting question though has language related to women really gotten worse over time if so given the advancements in womens suffrage and emancipation of the last century or so could the linguistic changes be a consequence of womens increasing status a backlash or alternatively given that many of these changes predate the th century is it likely that the language will tend to move in the opposite direction in the future reflecting the developing status of women
youre deciding whats important to me now how thoughtful
no real news to write about eh
in what way was it a rant
you mena like when he says the female equivalent of sir a woman of high rank is still used in formal contexts as a mode of address
really i thought it was quite interesting i dont necessarily follow the conclusions put forward but theres obviously something worth thinking about when you look at how the origin of so many of these words for women started off as a term that implied authority or at least neutrality and all have ended up as degrading insults how is that not worth at least thinking about nobody is stopping you from calling people by these words here ill help out youre a dirty wench p
i liked this article i in no way saw it as a feminist move to influence a dictionary but as an enlightening reflection on the way language is influenced by common usage and the corollary that common usage more often than not belittles womenthat is not something i find it trivial
french is worse every noun is either a dude or a female dude
excellent article thank you
i dont think the author is advocating censorship he is pointing out the arguably rather depressing implications of the changes in how certain words have been used over time so far as i can tell this is purely descriptive not proscriptive or even prescriptive
that list of words was drier than a dead dingos donger
this would mean a man devoid of any honour who scrounges of his wife sorry i dont really understand which part of my post youre talking about here
emasculate tends to be used in the sense of becoming less masculine not less powerful well what do such people mean when they say less masculine then masculinity has to mean something specific if youre going to talk about who is more masculine or less masculine what trait has to be missing in a man for him to be lacking in masculinity the thing is it almost always alludes to having ones strength or power stripped away here are the first two definitions you find if you put emasculating into a search engine  deprive a man of his male role or identity he feels emasculated because he cannot control his sons behaviour  make someone or something weaker or less effectivethe refusal to allow them to testify effectively emasculated the committee each uses of the word suggest that a man or a administrative body is emasculated when power is lost a man who cannot control have power over something like his kids is emasculated a committee is emasculated when its authority its power is weakened the idea is that it is undignified for men in particular to not be respected or seen as a strong and authoritative but not so for women its interesting that its a male word with no female equivalent because this implicitly suggests that women who dont have strength power or authority are just normal women there doesnt need to be a word for it because its not weird for a woman to be submissive but when men lack these things when theyre submissive and not very powerful its an affront to their very masculinity rather than their personhood in summary its a shit gender thing misogynistic and insulting to just about everybody
next theyll be wanting gender compensation to go along with the studies in oppression and all the other bollocks
we can make a solid start by using the word spinster as sparely as possible
exactly what youd expect in a judeochristian society patriarchal societies by definition must subjugate females try another society and see the difference
the dictionary that the guardian would have us all adopt would make george orwell blush
i picture writers sitting around an office looking around themselves unable to think of things to write about and be offended by then their eyes drift over to a nearby dictionary hm i wonder if theres something offensive in that
probably because monsters dragons trolls and orcs wouldnt sound quite as scary if they sounded like elmo p
not so much an idiot as an ignorant pedant patience is needed for this type of fool
that it can is not in question that it does for women as a rule has not been adequately demonstrated for the people here this in particular linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men does not have a linked citation if it was that well known a phenomenon then why doesnt he link to the researchobservation
how often do you hear the female equivalent term for misogyny or misogynist what are the underlying assumptions here
yep a shame that our wonderfully weird irregular verbs are being dumbed down to regular ed ending i read somewhere that someone dived into a pool next he will have forgetted where it was sad
you mean the evil ones are male thats sexist
only if it lusted after other bits of firewood
a futile attempt at justifying the truth behind a few words rarely used today when was the last time you used wench tart spinster etc next youll decry mr fletchers inability to make arrow flights or mr coopers lack of skill at barrel making youre wasting pixels
there are antimale sexist words old man winter cussing is more antimale than antifemale women are called bitchesfemale dogs or bad women men are called assholes more than women being called the inside of an anus is worse than being called a dog of any gender there is such a word as jackass there is no such word as jillass it is sexist when one refers to any woman as a bitch or whore
yes we need even more censorship and less freedom in speech after all someone might offend someone somewhere somehow and that cant be allowed no matter how many other people are offended by the nonoffensive language in other words in order not to offend someone just shut up and say nothing unless that offends the mutes who used to be dumb but are now only a button on the tv remote
have you noticed how so many pejorative words are bird names turkey gallah drongo chicken bird brain pigeon etc etc what does it all mean
these are pretty obvious candidates for sexist words almost to the point of making the article unnecessary more insidiously sexist words such as hysterical histrionic and lunatic each emanating from preoccupations with the female body and its perceived alignment with capriciousness would be better examples of sexist language to expose arguably it is more illuminating when words with a nongenderspecific remit are found to be arbitrarily grounded in feminine or masculine association
change it in the literature not in the dictionaryif a news story reports a pm as sexist then you need to change the pm not the news story
so if language relating to women gets worse over time then how did womens suffrage and eventual emancipation occur in englishspeaking countries
your attempts to point out hatred are admirable but how do you propose to remedy them would you alter oldspeak or introduce newspeak my apologies if im being a bit bossy here
right so according to you absolutely everyone who grew up through the fifties and sixties when sayings like the one i ed abounded are all mentally scared for life nup that wasnt what i was saying all i said was that its not true names do hurt a lot they exclude they take away identity they oppress youre not mentally scarred if youre not on the receiving end
yep pc is becoming an unintentional parody of itself
hmmm wonder what youd find if you put any other planetary language under the microscope
first comment i see is a sexist one what a surprise
you assume im a woman which im not
even notice how most evil monsters dragons trolls orcs and so on all have low rough voices
words change i can remember when faggot meant a piece of firewood
youre not wrong as such but most people would say spun imo
nah just saying get over it
just how is looking at the evolution of language over time absurd when i was at uni we made a list of every english adjective used to describe a person then analysed them according to whether they were gender specific or neutral then we listed them by gender and according to if they wee considered positive negative or neutral i remember that around  of the negative adjectives were used only for women it was quite shocking actually
and you obviously didnt understand it the line you ed is merely paraphrasing the oups explanation for their choice of example sentences as ed in the previous paragraph it is not an assertion of the author or the articles standpoint this is demonstrated by the sentence immediately following the one you ed which asks why choose feminist over say rightwinger communist or fan though and going on to state approval of the oups review of its chosen examples the article itself clearly implies disapproval of the oups chosen examples and the way they supposedly reflect the sexism within society and the english language
im sure many a man dreads the description confirmed bachelor
but then you didnt address the point of the article for every derisive term for women there is no doubt one for men that is not debated at all in the article this article was talking exclusively about words that have a gendered pair princeprincess governorgoverness where the male version retains its status and the female version becomes a term of derision id be interested if you can give an example of the opposite case because i cant think of one
grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens theres a reason for that
both in the text and the caption it says a spinster is someone who spun yarn or thread i thought that should be span but my dictionary says that span is archaic as the past tense of spin news to me am i just wrong or is there more to this
wench is alive well and magnificent
again its not the point of the argument but if you want to go there angel little boys and girls are equally called little angel because they are cherubic and as they get older because they act nicely conversely they are called little shits when they dont men are rarely called angels when they get big they are called studs or hunks or whatever no one is trying to argue there are not masculine and feminine traits or masculine and feminine descriptors the article says that of clearly defined gender descriptors like boygirl manwoman aviatoraviatrix actoractress there is evidence that the feminine version becomes a pejorative term in many cases whereas the masculine term retains its status no one has yet offered an example of the opposite case many people have like you have offered words that are often used to describe men pejoratively yes i get it there are those just like bitch whore slut harpy feminist dog fishwife etc are used exclusively for women but where is the example where say prince is a putdown but princess is a compliment in fact if anything thats another in the same series
david you are an idiot you might want to update your st century definition of madam iemadam secretaryhttpwwwimdbcomtitlett
this is getting really boring guardian just as words evolve so do their meanings you dont have to like it but this deliberate outrage is getting so tiresome
yes of course george eliot thanks
what a misplaced rant about centuries of linguistic evolution from todays perspective of political correctness guardianistas are reaching new heights of absurdity
a dictionary like any good reference book describes the world as it is not how we might like it to bethe oxford also lists a wide range of bad words that i personally find highly objectionable but i dont object to the dictionary listing them
it may reflect a change in society as groups moved from a matriarchal or equal culture to a patriarchal one but there is a lot of doubt about that kind of matriarchy conjecture which was popularised by marja gimbutas amongst others gods and goddesses may have also represented tribal or kinship groups each contending for the same area so when one goddess is in the ascendant so is one groupinanna suffered in that way deposed by marduk in sumer as power shifted north and as different groups seized power some religions can feature goddesses as idealised women but be particularly patriarchal towards real women see the worship of mary in catholicism
people are also missing the main focus of the article pejoration that language relating to women gets worse over time language controls how we perceive each other and so is very powerful this is a very sad message
i would pair the word dog with rabidactually
i dont like that word in the dictionary remove it at once so it shall not be used again
in arabic bib just means son of cf ben in hebrew bint means daughter of the somewhat derogatory use of bint by soldiers in the middle east says more about their and probably most mens attitudes towards women than anything else
that used to be the case but now we are upset by what we see in history in the news in the painted and written form and even in the dictionary and are compelled to change it
traditionally a governess was employed to teach the children of the upper classaristocracy so was not at all the same as the modern nanny or au pair
is someone capable of making you read an article you dont want to
i am reminded of when dr johnson published his dictionary he was visited by some rather grand tory ladies who thanked him for not including any vulgar words to which dr johnson replied thank you for looking
then a stage is reached where nothing need happen outside the confines of the guardians offices the heights are in hermetic stasis
reminds me of helene cixous work on the gendering of binary opposites with the masculine tending to have associations of strength but as i was also reading this c  those were the days the only example i can remember is sun m moon f
tautology added for effect so dont bother with pointing that out
i looked up priviledge per your request and was advised that the playing field will never be equal until everyone learns how to spell
hammersfan re i am sure just think if we hadnt invented alphabetic literacy we would have had the same holistic thinking as the rest of the animal kingdom instead of writing his book leonard shlain would have been shitting in the woods and sniffing the anuses of every other humanoid who walked past there are many indigenous peoples who still live without written alphabets and are far more capable and intelligent and i dare say educated than the average westerner a number of these indigenous peoples have spoken at the climate change talks and other world events but you probably wouldnt care to know anything about them maybe they dont drive cars or mess with the stock market but they know how to live in harmony with nature do you 
and that friends is about the average level of understanding that allows systemic sexism to prevail
im sure someone has said this already but the entire point of the oed is to give examples of a words usage throughout the actual written history of the language it is descriptive not prescriptive
what gender has given the world the majority of bridge builders over the centuries you may as well be saying that if we were all a bit more manlike we wouldnt be concerned with these frilly concerns
code for nothing to do with sexism unless its attached to that straitjacket on spirituality called religion
a womans void is more likely to be shrill under times of tension since a component of shrill is a higher pitch it is just a description of a type of sound one might also associate gravelly with menof course there are negative words that apply to one sex or another men are usually associated with temper violence stubbornness women with nagging catty remarks of course these are just generalisations but the dictionary is not suggesting they are always true just that this is a common association i would rather truthfulness from a dictionary than censorship of revealing phrases
ok fine now make a list of all of the speakers books plays ideas and so forth that you support and cherish and love that you personally are prepared to sacrifice in the name of avoiding harm to the sensitivities of others which of your favorite texts are you prepared to toss on the bonfire because someone somewhere finds them hurtful dont ask others to make sacrifices that you wont make yourself
id advise stella to edit her word lists these are very powerful tools and people should use them report the users responsible get them banned what else can anyone do idiots and inadequates are gonna use social media to get their kicks by threatening strangers its just a fact of modern life and i honestly dont see what more anyone can do to prevent it that isnt already being done at least not in a way that wont massively impact the rest of us twitters now introduced hour bans for telling anyone to eg f off ive fallen foul of that one myself when ive said it in a dismissive way to someone as in lol f off its not a development im happy about and i think maybe its tipped the scale over from the balance being right into a setup thats now starting to impact the average users experience people will just desert it for other platforms if they continue down this road
but what if those opinions actually are racisthomophobicsexist heres the problem if you label people who actually are not those things what label will you give to people who actually are those things when you say people who actually are not those things youre creating an impossible standard if someone expresses apparently racist views it is fair to assess that person as being racist you cant judge someones views by anything other than their words and actions after all and almost nobody selfidentifies as racist we all hold opinions and prejudices that do not hold up to scrutiny we also not at all the same thing express things in ways that can be misconstrued it behoves us to examine both if someone accuses you of being racisthomophobicsexist the likelihood is that your words have presented you as racisthomophobicsexist sure it may be that the fault lies with your listener it may also be that your listener is arguing in bad faith or is similarly expressing an unconsidered prejudice but it may also be that you hold unexamined prejudices or that you are using loaded language if the thing you said revealed a genuinely prejudiced belief well the accusation of racismhomophobiasexism is on target though you can reevaluate your assumptions of course it may well be that you hold some isolated beliefs that are racist or whatever while not being racist generally sort of vestigial prejudices if its just the language you can reassess and realign your modes of expression in order to be able to say what you actually mean to take an easy example calling someone coloured is highly racially loaded it is racist language you may use the word out of ignorance of that fact and hence be misconstrued as racist that means your language use is ineffective you are not saying what you want to say easy fix change your language to express what you want to say alternative refuse to change your language insist its pc bullshit continue to use the word coloured and knowingly use racist language in that case yeah fuck you youre probably racist and youre certainly an asshole the same goes for actions such as microaggressions you may be engaging in a behaviour that is aggressive without any aggressive intent and with no awareness of it once youve been made aware though you have a choice change your behaviour or carry on this time knowing that your behaviour is a problem
whys that are childhood lessons all accurate necessary and sacrosanct or is it possible some of them were shortsightedinaccurate and could do with being ditched
seems to be the main problem is a phrase that tacitly admits its a personal view rather than a proven fact i just come across considerably more of these cases where the bullies are leftwing
that you have a responsibility to think about the impact of your words on someone including yourself before you saywrite them i have no such responsibility sometimes its my intention to offend and so i go ahead and offend sometimes giving offence is entirely justified the raison detre of the fa is to guarantee the right to speech and other forms of expression that causes deep offence and is completely repugnant to almost everyone and is considered utterly beyond the pail of polite society that is its purpose by the way your use of the word praxis in that context makes no sense whatsoever
i dont disagree at all however comments on here tend to equate the theatre director from buckinghamshire as being typical of everyone on the left or the metropolitan liberal elite or whatever my mle friends are teachers social workers barristers engineers local authority workers doctors theres a midwife a couple of public health researchers a charity director and a few who work in business
antimatter but people are having their freedom to speak attacked and this is no longer just the bnp recently at goldsmiths a well known feminist and aethist was prevented from speaking because atheism offended some muslims httpwwwsecularismorguknewsislamiststudentstrytodisruptexmuslimmaryamnamaziestalkonblasphemyatgoldsmithsuniversity yes and notice how islamists and their enablers use the language of the social justice warriors they were actually demanding a safe space to protect their islamist views
that link to the wire isnt usable so i cant comment on whether its racist or not the reason i cant use it is it just brings loads of pictures of women in bikinis showing their tits for clicks so your commitment to free speech ends when it comes to naked women tits offend you but as a matter of fact when i click on the link nothing like that happens maybe it has something to do with your browser settings or your past google searches very progressive except that surprise the daily wire is a conservative journal it just happens to be one of the few with principles such as opposing altright hate speech
some white men are privileged many arent seems pretty obvious to me
if political correctness results in behaviour like the shrieking yale girl its advocates can expect a backlash and people taking the piss
i answered your question with examples no you didnt its a straight forward question that just needs a yes or no or dont know i think the person who would have killed hitler should have gained protection in the west countries when and for what
no argument about it and it makes me angry so angry in fact that i deal with these feelings by locking myself alone in a room and shouting very loudly and clearly a series of forbidden words one after the other i am always careful to enunciate each word very clearly and pause between shouting each new word this normally goes on for about half an hour after which i feel somewhat calmer i dont tell my firends or my wife that i do this im not proud about doing this but i feel its better that i do this than walk around in public shouting these words thank you
im also amazed by the freespeech argument and how reluctant we seem to be at just calling someone out for being what they are this is a gratuitous strawperson germane greer was recently no platformed its not just a couple of unlikable fringe odd balls
tribalism and defence of the team is the dark side of loyalty
there are two problems with this argument abi  youre ignoring the hecklers veto lets say im the president of my universitys debating club and i decide to arrange a debate about gender featuring germaine greer or a debate about abortion between two men now lets imagine that a student group decides this in unacceptable they start a petition that gets a few hundred names start a twitter hashtag and declare theyre going to protest and disrupt my debate i now have a choice either i pay for security to stop any possible disruption or i allow myself to be bullied into cancelling the event based upon the extreme views of a tiny minority the hecklers veto is becoming more and more prevalent all it takes to censure someone is a few hundred tweets a few thousand petition signatories or a small protest and despite this representing a tiny fraction of public opinion institutions will give in youre essentially arguing for the right of a minority to decide the views that others may or may not be exposed to its chilling  arguing that free speech has to be even somewhat curtailed because of microagressions is in my view as misguided and dangerous as arguing that human rights should be somewhat curtailed in the name of national security yes prevent people from inciting violence or disorder but other than that let people say what they want and challenge them furiously censorship is not the way
youve got to love the grauns continuing narrow perspectives on things come on in articles like this embrace the human race not just the bits you wantanyway the substance of the article is fantastic the line between offence and harm is very fine and sometimes we cant recognise it until harm has been done the answer is a step forward in maturity as a society something that is hard to do under the current political and media mindsetsstill i praise the author for looking at this
reedom of speech is not freedom from consequences of that speech say what you want but understand that people are then entirely within their rights to attack your positron antimatter but people are having their freedom to speak attacked and this is no longer just the bnp recently at goldsmiths a well known feminist and aethist was prevented from speaking because atheism offended some muslims httpwwwsecularismorguknewsislamiststudentstrytodisruptexmuslimmaryamnamaziestalkonblasphemyatgoldsmithsuniversity
yes
the lazy thing to do at this point would be to point to john stuart mills distinction between speech that harms and that which merely offends he argued that individuals should be free to behave as they please as long as their behaviour doesnt harm others but this freedom should allow for the causing of offence no that would be the perfect starting point mill nails it unfortunately the distinction is difficult to make precise and operational to fully resolve what is acceptable speech and what is not we would have to have a widely accepted ethical theory of what is acceptable harm we can inflict upon others through speech this is because dishing out harm through speech is unavoidable the harm inflicted by some remark is not only a function of that remark but also of the psychological makeup of the person on the receiving end of it some people are less harmed by being the target of racist slurs than others are for being called idiots yet we generally hold that the former is unacceptable speech but the latter is not a theory of acceptable harm would have to explain why needless to say that a fully satisfactory theory of this sort will not be forthcoming anytime soon from those that have seriously thought about free speech and even if they came up with something it would be ignored because if public discussion is more than naked self interest at all it is about setting the parameters so your team can win not intellectual consistency
you really havent heard of the rotherham case in denial or refuse to read anything other than the guardian
yeah think you kind of missed the point
of course there is a resemblance both show a rabid desire to micromanage and control communication of civilians in our society you will lose your job after a twitter mob records you saying last years word to describe a member of an ethnic group in a totalitarian regime you would likely disappear if you upset the regime so they only differ in terms of the punishments meted out
i would imagine that it for courts to decide what you cannot say that is the decider anything else is fair game and down to ones own sense of decency my wasp culture may be showing
can we not kill them allheres some violent fanatical islamophobia for yallhttpswwwtheguardiancomusnewsfebnorthcarolinaislamophobiamuslimsthreats
proof please
people keep a world view that makes them feel safe amp justified absolutely living is actually a very scary business and i think we do all sorts of stuff to survive temporarily the experience people will believe what they want regardless to a point but only to a point otherwise in the west slavery would still be going on women would still be subject to the authority of their husbands and poor white men would still be the servants and canon fodder for rich white men ermokayi take your point there are new forms of slavery racism misogyny is still rampant and poor people still die in wars to make rich men even richer but its not as bad as in the past progress has been made
nope they no more have to host your postings than they have to publish your letters or any articles you send them nobody is stopping you from participating in the debate they are only stopping you from participating in the debate here just as i have the right to stop you arguing with me in my own kitchen but have no right to stop you shouting in the street they might just not want to show your posts because they are rubbish their house their rules
that you have a responsibility to think about the impact of your words on someone including yourself before you saywrite them seems you agree with that in spite of what you initially began arguing unless you think nihilism or praxis is a strong basis for a civil society of course
moves from the category of noplatforming into violent repression i would call it successful noplatforming via violent repression i fear a dangerous precedent has been set but i take your point can we not at least agree that even in the case of nonviolent noplatforming it is more desirable for students to listen to the speaker and to counter their positions with rational arguments once the floor has been opened it would certainly be a more effective strategy against outragefeeders like yiannopoulos
a student activist group at the university of michigan is demanding campus officials provide them with a permanent designated space on central campus for black students and students of color to organize and do social justice work the clamour for a segregated space for students of color to organise social justice efforts comes even as the public university builds a  million center for black students in the center of campus in their demands students explain why the new black student center is not enough because we want a space solely dedicated to community organizing and social justice work specifically for people of color gtfights against segregation gtwants to be segregated gtnext theyll be asking for separate bathrooms and water fountains
i think the english particularly have some sort of genetic disposition to resisting fascism amp religious fascism with all its inherent speech amp though oppression because the country experienced it firsthand before any other european state afaik under the puritans they were basically the taliban of the day banning any fun and demanding compulsory worship enforced by brutal army dictatorship rule the english threw that off and for ever after they resist even the sniff of such things maybe
condoning something and thinking it should not be illegal are not the same thing is that behaviour abhorrent and should it be condemned yes should someone be locked up for it i am not so sure
freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences of that speech say what you want but understand that people are then entirely within their rights to attack your positron also if youre actually calling for violence against a particular group guess what thats hate speech its fucking dangerous and it should be shut down heres how this works islam is repressive towards women free speech we should nuke the middle east until it glows hate speech im sure you can think of other examples but these are just a couple that ive seen on comment boards that came to mind
or even the difference between on the one hand saying sentence a and on the other hand following around an individual black person whispering sarcastically that all humans are created equal regardless of skin colour while stroking your clenched fist thats clearly behaviour that threatens physical violence despite the innocuous agreeableness of the words being spoken worth noting that your example would be governed by entirely different laws surrounding threatening behaviour stalking etc
yes yes still its going to be a real hoot a riot even watching the left turn on a sixpence and islam when its not worthless virtue signaling at stake but actual votes and seats in parliament
do you agree with cursing on childrens tv no then you believe there are lines to be drawn with free speech its a coherent argumentwhatever the platform that is being used for free speech if it violates the owners of the platforms code of conduct they have the right to deny future access to the platform simple as go shit in a toilet and not on someone elses table unless you are going to argue you should be able to shit on someone elses table if you wanted to as shitting is a human right you cant deny and you would argue you have the right to shit whereever you want
brilliant swathes of virtue signalling there jim unfortunately it totally missed the point of the argument but you looked good for the feminists eh men can be a lot smarter and stupider than women gottit
never
i think they are only too aware and know how effective it was these people are embedded talking heads nodding away for their globalist masters
im surprised there isnt more comment on how profit motives influence the increasingly extreme nature of provocative speech now that clicks and attention are commodities people make money by expressing their worst inner selves add to this the peculiar modern social media phenomenon of brand me a persona that can or must be curated projected and therefore defendedand you get the conditions simultaneously for great offense both taken and given im also amazed by the freespeech argument and how reluctant we seem to be at just calling someone out for being what they are milo can say what he likes but lets not be afraid to just call him an asshole and an opportunist and move on
let me be deliberately contentious in turn do you believe intelligence is a virtue do you believe all other things being equal that opinions reached through the application of greater intelligence will be worth more than those reached through lesser intelligence if the answer is yes then going forward from there do you believe everyone is equally intelligent the answer here is presumably hopefully no in which case youve painted yourself into a corner people do not in general choose those who govern them without factoring in personal estimations of their intelligence trump supporters repeatedly and widely express the belief that trump is very intelligent a successful businessman a man whose views seem accurate and informed a proven intellect many people who support farage will frequently mention the fact that his intelligence is proven by his success in a separate field from politics intelligence is held the world over to be a positive virtue and it is an inescapable corollary of valuing intelligence that you will devalue stupidity the rest comes down to who you believe is intelligent and who you believe is stupid theres no point trying to escape from this paradigm unless you want to argue that everyone is equally intelligent and intelligence is unimportant which would be stupid
i wonder what all these anti political correct academics make of their youtube following what with every video being entitled so and so obliterates sjw moron or some such because obviously no creator of youtube videos wants to see  views on their latest post so they have to give a title that is not really delivered on and what do they make of their hyena like army of commenters spewing bile yet ironically praising their heros eliquence
liberalleftist witch hunts purges and shaming campaigns as well as influential media or politics people using their influence in response to speech do have real consequences people lose their jobs are banned are shunned and stop expressing their views which is of course the goal of those campaigns along with schadenfreude example
it seems to have escaped the author of the article that some things are total or they dont exist surely free speech is one of those things you cant have half hearted free speech and theres a debate to be had sounds like the author has already made her mind up without having the debate
why not tell your daughter the truth you will encounter men and women who are smarter and stupider than you live your days in such a way that you can bear to live with them eternallyalan moore
not only can you have them both but there is a cartoon strip that perfectly explains this free speech
thats actually a pretty good point one thing that always gets forgotten in these kinds of debates is that whereas the enlightenment valued free speech above everything else they never saw it as an end in itself they cherished it as a means as the best method to guarantee that wisdom will assert itself and reason will prevail and they did it precisely because they knew that speech had consequences todays antipc free speechbrigade is exactly the opposite they see it as their ultimate right to make public whatever crosses their mind no matter how offensive or hurtful or just plain false it is they care nothing for the impact their words have on others as long they see their sacred right to express themselves asserted and when it isnt its all about them being the victim its a deeply atomistic antisocial view of society and it cares nothing whatsoever about values such as reason wisdom or truth to take a prominent example what is the substance of the important perspective this milo guy was supposed to bring to cpac that the new ghostbusters movie sucks and tellingly the very moment milo actually said something that was not only troublesome but also in a way quite honest about human sexuality something that could actually have been worthwhile of discussion he becomes toxic to the antipcbrigade and they drop him like a hot potato thats not saying anything about how to deal with these people and indeed i think the riots that took place in berkeley were not only stupid but more importantly counterproductive why couldnt they come up with something more original like standing ovations at all the wrong moments or hordes of women screeching and calling for milo to make them a child but i think it is extremely important to keep this distinction in mind when debating the subject
in their crusade against the dastardly social justice warriors the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of the bodies of  cartoonists slaughtered in cold blood say otherwise
i didnt know that how very interesting what worries me is things like this httpwwwspikedonlinecomnewsitearticlejesuisbillyboyfreespeechforfootballfans lets not feel sorry for places like saudi arabia when you can be handed  months jail here in the uk in this day and age for the crime of singing a song on your way to a football game
yes of course but people such as stella creasy had death and rape threats that must be terrifying and immediately moves the hate from beyond the neutrality of the page
i agree with you but is there any point in debating with professional trolls like hopkins and yinannapolous its obvious that theyre just people who get a kick out of causing offence and controversy
did you read any of the links i provided as a whole white men are more privileged than everyone else western society is set up to benefit them yes some white men earn very little and some black people or hispanic people earn more than them but the privilege is still there for the most part chris rock and isaiah washington both successful actors still regularly get pulled over by the cops for no reason you never hear of that from white actors do you but then again they arent driving while black beyonce gets ridiculous criticism including threats that the police will stop doing their job for her because she dared to celebrate her culture and racial politics yet the confederate battle flag is still being flown by states do you understand what i am saying
it was always called sending someone to coventry when applied within a social group it can be devastating in some sects the same treatment is called shunning
the left do not on the whole seem to be overly keen on free speech only what it deems correct speech this leads to them promoting and supporting only those who use free speech to espouse views they deem correct and implying that is the only view worth considering this is especially evident and concerning to some with regards to religion it would be good if there were more counterbalancing critiques from prominent atheists or even brave reformers ie maajid nawaz or ayaan hirsi ali not in the same paper usually which suggest both left and right are only interested in pushing their version of the truth on any topic rather than inspiring any objective true discussion
yes its true that uc berkeley chancellor nicholas dirks condemned the violence which he said was committed by more than  armed people using paramilitary tactics this would be the black bloc group which fronted the berkeley against trump coalition protesters they spearheaded the riot they peppersprayed people and beat them with flagpoles they fired rockets at the police and pelted them with rocks and stun grenades they used barricades as battering rams against the building and were only finally beated back by rubber bullets and tear gas they simply carried out with violence the stated aim of the batc protesters which was to shut down the lecture and they succeeded but maybe youre right and the peaceful protesters were appalled by the violence and are right now organising a not in my name march somehow i doubt it nesrine malik for example opined that that violence against racists to stop trump should be tolerated or how about india knight who tweeted that trumps hopedfor assassination was taking such along time just as a matter of interest dmk did you condemn the violent rioters
so what youre saying is that the majority gets to dictate what everybody gets to hear regardless of what the minority thinks if an avid group of rightwing activists protested the invitation of a progressive speaker because they found their views somehow harmful which many conservatives do would you be happy for that invitation to be rescinded why cant we just protest by a putting forward a better argument or b not buying tickets
i suspect were heading down a dead end here that being that i see that position as entirely unenforceable and you clearly dont speech offense and possibly most importantly intent are just too messy and subjective irony dark humour shock humour banter they all muddy the waters i should clarify that what i am against is legal prosecution for having said words no matter how outrageous those words are short of having directly incited violence threatening actions and behaviour are another matter consider the difference between a kkk member being allowed to say something repulsive like ai believe that ns are subhuman and bi believe ns should be rounded up and killed or even the difference between on the one hand saying sentence a and on the other hand following around an individual black person whispering sarcastically that all humans are created equal regardless of skin colour while stroking your clenched fist thats clearly behaviour that threatens physical violence despite the innocuous agreeableness of the words being spoken in a far more manic way ive drunk far too much coffee today im basically echoing those above who have pointed out that the context of the speech is more important than the speech itself
if anyone wants to make an argument for greater civility in these highly toxified and polarised times then great its all part of the discourse words are great and the more we have of them the better what i wont sit quietly back and accept is censorship and if youre you know some theatre director from buckinghamshire whos taking it upon yourself to police the tone and vocabulary of people who may not share your education or breeding well you need to understand that people express themselves in a large variety of different ways so try to be understanding about that a lof of this is about very privileged people policing the language of those who might not have their eloquence theres no excuse for anyone to be openly offensive just dont do it i would like to see people being encouraged to be civil rather than have restrictions placed on our ability to express ourselves though
why can i only give this one like its so unfair 
well to be honest they may learn something if they were prepared to listen living in an isolated echo chamber does them no good
really theres the weasel word
yes i was delberately being contentious because of youcanclaimthats atitude let say you met somone in real life who actually believed they were more intelligent than most and that therefore their opinion was worth more than yours what do you think are the chances that such a person is up to the hard task of inward reflection and considering the views of stupid people ig i had to bet good money id say that he is far too conceited based on his evident disdain for the watters to even consider he had a flaw
but if thought corrupts language language can also corrupt thought george orwell  arguably the left have tried to alter thoughts by policing language and some of that was reasonable in a polite society but having achieved some successes with the worst language they thought they could achieve still more but are now being called out for unreasonable policing of language no platforming etc
 i really dont know what you mean by that i am distant from them then im sure youre familiar with how frustrating it is when racists and xenophobes complain that theyre being silenced after you point out that their arguments are racist and xenophobic
who is free to offend if i offend my colleagues ill be reprimanded if my students offend me ill give them a detention if a football player offends another with a racist comment theyll be punished being offensive is not a freedom it generally isnt allowed
the article author here suggests theres no significant censorship going on not above the line there isnt but below the line is it is routine and it is often totally unjustified not breaking any house rules even journalists both on the right and the left can say whatever they like its just ordinary people who are constantly being censored muzzled and thats why the brexit vote and the election of president trump came as such as shock to the establishment the establishment muzzled the people so they could no longer hear what their opinions were so the people spoke in the only way they could with their votes
this is the one that wrote the tears of joy emoji is the worst of all its used to gloat about human suffering back in november people like her arent a part of the problem they are the problem
i answered your question with examples there are nuances shades of gray here is another example i think the person who would have killed hitler should have gained protection in the west countries dont you think
correct use of grammar is racist didnt you get the memo
political correctness is just fascism disguised as manners g carlin remember him i wonder how you lot would treat him were he alive today
so because there might be a fireno one is free to speak their mind in all other spheres of life
i like frankie boyle
look at what is going on is uk universities and safe spaces universities for crying out loud really so a handful of students tried to stop a talk by germaine greer at cardiff there have probably been a few other incidents that hardly consitutes a national crisis does it it would be great if these things could be discussed in calm and rational manner without resorting to hyperbole and hysterics
no one has a right not to be offended if we structure our discourse around the principle of avoiding microaggressions the result will be a race to the bottom to shield the most pathologically neurotic people from the truth and cater to their delusions if the truth is hard to swallow the solution isnt to shut people up when they say something distasteful the solution is to encourage people to strengthen their character and so to speak grow a pair
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening depends on what you mean by enforcing the greatest restriction of free speech can be dished out by the government theres very little of that in the us and not much more in the uk though quite a bit more of that on the continent but even when the government does not punish the utterers of unwelcome views other powerful actors can harm someone in comparable ways if they so choose the suppression of unwelcome speech is then similar collective action of many not so powerful people can accomplish the same thing like witchhunts this is what winning the culture war is all about unlike the genuinely worrying authoritarianism of theresa mays government which is backed up with political power censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger not really liberalleftist witch hunts purges and shaming campaigns as well as influential media or politics people using their influence in response to speech do have real consequences people lose their jobs are banned are shunned and stop expressing their views which is of course the goal of those campaigns along with schadenfreude but hey it isnt the government beheading someone for saying the wrong things and thats clearly the only conception of free speech thats important right
but you dont want me to be politically correct do you do you i dont mind but i would like you to say whether or not you think a violent backlash should be protected
is that an example of noplatforming its my understanding that noplatforming refers to invitations to speak being withdrawn following protests or the registering of disapproval by groups of students what occurred at berkeley was a violent riot and thus moves from the category of noplatforming into violent repression surely which i havent and would not advocate
we have laws against inciting violence or against speech that might directly cause others harm the wellknown fire in a crowded theatre scenario worth noting that this example was invented as a legal argument to jail an antiwar protester in  for having distibuted leaflets criticizing the draft during the war
yes it is because free speech has consequences in society as well as online thats an obviosity whats your point
if im rewriting history youre writing steve bannons wank fantasy ok so you still believe trump and brexit came out of the blue really
i think the difficulty is that once upon a time coloured people was the politically correct term and then it begins to be used in a derogatory manner and so over time it starts to be considered inherently derogatory i do think that sometimes we should pay more attention to context and the intentions of the speaker but in writing and over the internet tone and intention are hard to gauge especially given how sloppily people sometimes communicate but at the same time who is actually hurt by being asked to say people of colour rather than coloured people often the outrage about pcness is because people feel they are being criticised for a choice of word and they would rather someone else felt attacked instead of them shouldnt we just learn to accept that we might sometimes unintentionally offend and apologise for the misstep andor justify our position surely if we truly have something of value to say then we can find a way to express it without offending at least in the case of poor word choice if theres something more fundamentally problematic with the viewpoint then this might be too simplistic a solution
people against immigration are always saying they cant discuss it but the subject is constantly being debated and discussed immigration has dominated question time for the past few years ive stopped watching qt recently because im actually really bored of hearing people talk about immigration then you have the likes of farage saying one minute he wants to have a grown up debate and the next blaming being late for a meeting on immigration so why do you think the debate has been shut down wheres your evidence
i agree with your point about it being two ways i am in favour of free movement of people and having a thick skin is extremely important when dealing with people from different culturesi dont however believe in the concept of offensiveness or being offended i have never felt offended in my life there are things i like or dont like that is my own responsibility and my dislike of something does not privilege me in regard to it i have no authority to shut it down unless it is demonstrably harming othersi have felt upset angry hurt etc many times but never offended
i think that in trying to enforce good manners on others we have fostered a new world of intolerance where correctness has become a new way of dominating opinion in a middle class environment one of the most powerful reasons for the inevitable backlash is that it fails to recognise that good people can behave badly sometimes and bad people can hide behind a conformity to the new norms it patronises provides a means of point scoring and reinforces hypocrisy of the worst kind what is really sad is fails to take account of life on the margins where far more fundamental issues like getting enough food predominate we have ended up with people who are sensitive to correct ways of speaking but who live on credit avoid taxes drive massive x diesel cars move into catchment areas with the best schools and in reality say one thing but actually do something quite different we have to accept other peoples limitations poor judgement and social clumbsiness and cope with life and all its difficulties rather than complain about everyone elses behaviour
i assume you are being ironic because the most heavily censored comment section in the world including china is the one you are reading now just look at the comment censored listingsand those are the ones that pass the computer censor first
free speech includes the right to make vast generalisations in the hope you gain an audience for your ideas
i couldnt agree more i recently had a heated debate with a friend who is  she said that causing offence was something that shouldnt be allowed that it should be illegal when i pointed out that suffragettes caused offense that gay men holding hands in public caused offense that same sex marriage caused offense etc etc she really had nowhere to go what she meant was that being a dick should be illegal not causing offense id love to see that law introduced i sentence you to five years for common dickery
if im rewriting history youre writing steve bannons wank fantasy
i clumsily sent my respose to you to ragansar its just down there
the problem has been the brexit alf garnetts know their life well enough not to value being able to decide to up sticks and live in berlin or paris or naples because they are never going to do it they see a pole in the arndale and they think hes getting away with something that was theirs sure but the problem was also the supercilious tools who thought they could talk down to people who werent like this and expect them to do as their betters told them the wailing and gnashing of teeth when said alf garnets didnt respond well to accusations of stupidity racism and xenophobia was too fucking late for the country what happened a lot was instant abuse was aimed at anyone daring to question the benefit of eu membership was always unlikely to convert anyone who was wavering or experiencing for themselves the low side of the average benefit all eu migrants bring the exacerbation of the govts failure to address funding and resource shortages what should have happened was listening to these people and explaining that however shit things with us in the eu were they would be highly unlikely to be better and likely to be a shitload worse out of it its hardly rocket science or deep psychology that if you abuse people like that calling them racist stupid and blaming immigrants for all their woes that they turn to those who are listening to their concerns or appearing to at least that rant of yours about brexit alf garnets demonstrates more vitriol hatred and bigotry aimed at a far larger group than eu migrants in the uk than you appear to assume all brexit voters have towards said pole in the arndale
why not come out of linguistic hiding what is it specifically that you personally want to say or do that political correctness is stopping you from saying doing and what specifically do you think ought to be done to lift that hindrance i didnt actually say it was my perception i said there is a perception i have a perception there a is perception if you like are you denying there is a perception that political correctness is preventing those discussions taking place if so what is this article responding too
sorry
you realise that the situations people are talking about are cases where right wing speakers have been invited by student societies at government funded institutions who have then been noplatformed by left wing rioters trying to burn the place down using threat of violence to silence their political opponents thats the context not whatever fantasy you think youre talking about makes up context while presuming to speak for every other person in here accuses anyone else of talking about fantasy audacious
it is then followed by poor and inconsistent justification attacking political opposites is challenging them defending political bias is due to disagreements are just hate a lack of self awareness or critical analysis is obvious everywhere you could reasonably argue that politicians are being held in such low regard for much the same reasons they either repeat their position without any further elaboration or answer the question they wish you had asked
sorry but all freedoms incur cost millions have died to free themselves from unfair rule from slavery and for other freedoms more abstract not to mention freedom of comment being offended is a cost i openly welcome if it means freedom of speech go ahead and offend me just do not try telling me what i can and cannot say
the us constitution is the ultimate authority here and not some boilerplate un document so thats easily dealt with and dismissed its not an absolute right at the intersection where it violates other constitutionally guaranteed rights but the before speech or expressive acts here do not fall under fa protection it has to pass a number of tests and the barrier is deliberately set very high you are completely free here to be as big a racist bigot or homophobe as you like or join the kkk or westboro baptist church and advocate their views and protest with them and that is completely protected speech as it should be in any civilized society
and you have just dismissed all the views you dont agree with as crap no i didnt online equivalent of campus students noplatforming speakers whose views they disagree with no it isnt the guardian makes dozens of editorial decisions every day about what they feature who they publish how they present the news etc its how a news organisation works they do not have to publish anything they dont want to they are free to saypublish what they choose not what you want them to saypublish thats freedom of speech on that note freedom of speech and expression is not just about the state but also serves to protect religions and minority social groups from the will of the majority whatever it does not mean the guardian is under any obligation to allow you to write comments on every page of its website you have also given a very partisan response in painting blah blah blah sorry ive no idea what youre referring to in this paragraph maybe youve confused me with a different commenter
you overlook the vast grey area between i do not like x and we should murder x have you seen riefenstahls films cutting images of people identified as jewish with pictures of rats in a sewer is possibly worse than a plain injunction to violence which can be seen for what it is who will rid me of this turbulent priest incitement or free expression
firewoman police woman spokeswoman headmistress
forgive me but i think ill pass on whatever the american dialect society thinks of the english language
just drop them why
policewoman spokeswoman etc
who refers to unknown doctors as he
mrtarifa john and jane popped in they said bert had died who said he did or she did or they both did simultaneously clearly in this instance it does not matter which of them imparted the information the important part is that bert had died who spoke is irrelevant had it been important the name of the informant would have been used
using you suggests a singular personality maybe they have several can it be denied that outing them as a singular identity might be a little inconsiderate identity is a complex issue for many and so it would be a good practise to be more considerate
its not funny who died and made you the god of jokes its not making the point you were trying to make ah perhaps you would like to explain the point i was trying to make then since you have evidently read my mind
actually though i appreciate the assumption of my youth i am as near as dammit  and i have been in deep in the field of english language for the past  years i am sure that even my parents would have said for example someones at the door could you let them in does that really sound wrong to you
nope its you no its definitely thyyourhisheritstheir fault for missing the joke
yalls for the genitive perhaps
does this guy you know not know whether he is a man or a woman heres a clue in fact two of them i live in spain where i generally speak castellano i have spent a great deal of my life earning a living by teaching english to spaniards
presumably languages without genderspecific pronouns have had exemplary nonsexist cultures for centuries the article proposes a causal link but unless such cultures exist the argument is surely disproved meanwhile we should relax and go on using he she or they as we see fit totally ignoring the first world preoccupations of a handful of feminists
the use of they as a singular pronoun is nothing but an offence to our delicate and beautiful language it brings to mind the royal we
this isnt really an article about gender in language its an article about using male pronouns when dealing with a singular person of unknown gender for instance referring to scientists and doctors by default as he and thereby either by accident or design implying that those things are inherently male preserves in english the word doctor has no gender but default pronoun he definitely not only has gender bust specifically tells us that the person referred to is male that is a completely different concept from the fact that say in french a door la porte is feminine while a harbour le port is masculine
wibble wibble
i think she is actually an american
ive used they as a singular pronoun for years but have been criticised on many occasions for doing so especially for its use in academic writing
thou shouldst also start inflecting thy verbs thou knowest naah cant see that catching on 
she is so clunky and jarring that i cannot bring myself to use it
youre right its called social evolution
my mistake of course the bishop could be gay as the actor or actress said to the bishop
rj h what about she as an allencompassing pronoun please decline she
you may lose information but i guess the question is whether that is useful information you think im being patronising but why is it important for your children to know the gender of their teacher in advance and what happens when you dont want to specify a gender if you use either he or she youre supplying misleading information and heshe is pretty clumsy thats why their is much clearer in these circumstances no one is suggesting you shouldnt use he or she when referring to a specific gender
lorraine berry ponders how to rid the english language of sexism and make it more gender neutral but often indulges in the irritating term of mansplaining like a lot of things of this regard it all starts with you the manwomanperson in the mirror just google lorraine berry and mansplaining she just loves being gender specific when it suits her
german also genders chairs trains and cups of coffee without asking them how they identify first so is it really a model to follow yes quite german really does have a problem here because gender in such languages does not necessarily equate to sexto take one of many absurd examples an angel is always masculine der engel even when itshe is quite clearly female i once had to translate a shortish text on a modern opera in which an important character not named was an angel it was only by going to the website and finding a picture that i ascertained the angel in question was female but if i had just translated it as written i would have been referring to the angel as he him etc whenever the pronoun came upand a reader of the german would have been no wiser either
as someone who has no idea what youre really talking about what rights do non binary people not have genuine question not trying to troll i just dont understand how gender makes a difference to your rights maybe maternity paternity leave issues what would the non binary version of maternity leave be
fireman police man spokesman head master
just wait
the only reason my wife burnt her bra was because it got on her tits
not really as how other people self identify is really none of your business exactly i identify as someone who does not recognise the concept of gender nonbinary this is none of your business
after we have solved the problem with heshe can we move on to the sexism rampant in the difference in the meanings of the two sentences the grand old duke of york he had ten thousand men and the corresponding the grand old duchess of york she had ten thousand men personally i think they is no great problem as counterpoise says it is current in spoken english and the problem posed by the plural nature of they is really no greater than the problem posed by the plural nature of you in german sie sie is used for a polite form of thou for you for she and for they certainly it makes some problems for learners of german but it does not usually seem to cause a problem for germans themselves
she
this can also be a problem when referring to other animals when preferring not to use the ubiquitous it
using they instead of he or she isnt reconstructing our entire civilisation though is it
when it comes to conserves i go with either marmalade or parpalad
is it also worth pointing out that the term gender in language has nothing to do with sex necessarily some languages have many genders
whereas you only concern yourself with important things like searching out an article on grammar amongst the hundreds of articles about war famine pestilence and westminster on which to post your unique insight
im not sure what this article is saying thats new as it points out they is a genderneutral pronoun unusually with a long and venerable history it feel out of favour for some reason possibly because it could lead to awkward constructions a person could hurt themself but is now coming back and is recommended in most style guides im not sure that its a particular problem of english true french has on italian si and german man as genderneutral equivalents of one but used much much more in formal language if youre referring to a group of  women and one man you always use the masculine for the purposes of agreements pronouns etc
spurs newcastle obviously now theres a contentious statement
turkish has no genderspecific pronouns turks of course are well known for exemplary behaviour with respect to gender politics i was once told as a kid that all hurricanes were female because women were so destructive better than being treated as a potential rapistpaedomurderer if you are as a man i suppose how many male staff in nurseries
that wouldnt have helped its not funny and its not making the point you were trying to make
i disagree she disagrees he disagrees it disagrees we disagree they disagree maybe you disagree
i think the average broadsheet newspaper publishes about  words a day or the same as a longish phd thesis dont e me on that but thats a number i recall from an article a few years ago there are clearly a lot of things being worried about including the television listings and the sudoku you dont think an article about grammar warrants any space at all once in a while
did you object to star trek when they decided to boldly split infinitives too
samuel taylor coleridge rejected he as the generic pronoun in order to avoid particularising man or woman or in order to express either sex indifferently he wrote in his notebooks settling on it as an ideal neutral solution just use the generic pronoun she unlike they it avoids any doubt as to whether you have misused they as a singular pronoun in spoken english just use she and he as interchangeable generic pronouns
a simple example so you could understand it shame it was wrong eh
really where in the article i cant see it ive never heard of such a thing
there is no sexism gender neutral language is everywhere fire fighters police officers spokes persons head teachers etc etc
no pretty sure it was an actress
he plays for spurs sorry they play for spurs no they plays for spurs last go spurs player sorted
not to mention geordie where you hear eg divvent dee that man howay man sharon
oddly enough all the their examples from fowler sound perfectly natural to me except the fielding one which id probably say as everyone in the house was in their beds
also you get eggs off hens you could surely see the negative connotations femisists would make out from that
if you want to insist on having he said that bert was dead then the first sentence would have to be phrased thus john popped in with jane that would make he said that bert was dead grammatical
not really its a problem that crops up frequently in all kinds of writing its worth discussing ways of solving it
it works for the nominative but not for the accusative or genitive pronouns
a simple example so you could understand it
indeed i did see what you did there and then i saw it again when you told me what you did there you make a fair point did you see what i just did
and as the article says it has been in use since  in chaucer
huh people are using they instead of i
actor
nope its you
because the slash is ugly and we have an existing word that does the job
is this a us english thing in the uk ive used and seen used they when talking about a genderunknown person since i could read and write eg if anyone in your family is considering voting for ukip they should have a long look at themself in the mirror
theres nothing left about this insanity
english is a germanic language as is german they have quite a lot in common
i dont think any one is suggesting that we do away with he and she just not use he as a default pronoun or he or she which is clumsy if we were talking about the queen for example at which point would you refer to her as they the queen went to westminster where they sat on the throne if anyone is suggesting that it is stupid but i dont think anyone is
oi waiter theres a sack of rats in my jam sandwich
i dont suppose there will ever be a day when something doesnt have to change because someone asserts that the status quo is discriminatory and feels offendeddiscriminated against
poor old guradian always exercises about nothing
tell that to a glaswegian
just as the right is full of incompetent misogynistic racists intent on killing every disabled person on benefits
heavens to betsy youve rather cherry picked your other languages and just as well you live your life in the neurotic bubble that is english sorry british culture most other languages are embedded with gender specific words and you cant avoid them boys in italian ragazzi children including those who identify as female of course ragazzi oh dear dont think of crossing the channel will you unless its to somewhere cold
over the years many contracts and other legal documents have passed over my desk and one thing sticks out solicitors do not like doubt one piece of legalese that sticks in my mind is the preamble for the avoidance of doubt he means she and his means hers insofar as the context allows
i was simply suggesting that your ageist condescension towards laurasia was misplaced since the use of they as a singular has been in accepted usage since at least the th century i didnt claim any of the things which you ascribe to me you seemed to have worked yourself up into a lather all by yourself
theres nothing progressive about forcing people to recognise that youre halffish halfmonkey
and sounds like a ladybird book what like your example you mean
luckily the vast majority of us dont speak to people who find the use of he or she offensive or inappropriate
this has always seemed like a nonissue to me singular they has a long history sounds natural and solves the problem of gender exclusive language i started using it in my writing and translating many years ago
jolly patronising you happen to lose information but your approach  here we come
you is used as a singular pronoun now but it wasnt always thus and it has kept all the old plural agreements even when standing for one person the singular form is thou or thee it is now time for the third person singular pronouns to go the way the second person singular pronouns went centuries ago time indeed for each pupil is responsible for their own books to become correct english
maybe they just dont care
you have the right to selfidentify we have the right to ignore that declaration
more to the point i dont think its practical to ask the oed in effect to endorse the sentiment behind anything it uses as a ation to demonstrate usage im sure there are all sorts of ations in oed about all manner of objectionable acts but if they demonstrate how a word is used in real life thats all that can really matter from a dictionarys perspective
how do you pronounce it thought so
nothing else to worry about clearly
thats one example of it being used in a th century text which suggests it was an accepted usage in chaucers time and as the references to shakespeare shows continued to be so in the late th century why are you finding it so hard to accept
the germans use she to mean one kind of you she to mean they and her to mean another kind of you this proposal under discussion already standard seems pretty straightforward in comparison
what kind of world could this be if humans were just people and not genders to be seperated and set against each other the only use for sex is procreation of which humans forget is not the entirety of humans else all humans are are breeding units humanity can be much more with a little thought
he she him her as the actress said to the bishop just drop them
and lynne although this doesnt always go down so well with the rougher types of men one has to pick ones moment if one and all are approached as a long lost family member a good deal of mutual uplift and appreciation usually follows on naturally enough except at night when people are more tense
sorry to shout
hey lorraine you have another chum working for the guardian with a passion for journalism leigh alexander writes about the intersection of technology and popular culture with a passion for the trends and human stories behind the products and services she likes feminism video games and clicking the heart icon on any social network that has one cp snow turn in your grave guardian give your readers some bloody journalism not this intern guff please like whot it used to be 
bs its ugly clumsy and sounds like a ladybird book to keep repeating john john john at the beginning of each sentence and john is clearly he
the push for it is new the use of it is old
thats the problem its one sensible article in a collection of really bad ones about equality written by the oxbridge privately schooled people who run this paper
and here was me thinking that they was taken as a negative descriptor used by racists sexists all sorts of ists used to cover up their ist
perhaps i should have said informal rather than wrong but its only recently been accepted in some style guides and im arguing forthat how does that make me blinkered i could suggest you finetune your outrage filter but i wouldnt want to be so bloody rude
which is why the author is suggesting using a language construct that is already widely used and only considered wrong by pedants
before we crow too loudlyremember his and hersand there still a number of things in the english that we tend to associate with gender
german is a very beautiful language theres always one or is that only one
german is a very beautiful language it is a language which i am fluent in and yes to achieve that fluency i had to work jolly hard im imagining the tears of thousands of language students if this reform goes through
san is not the only title in japanese there are others in common use including the more formal sama and the less formal chan and kun kare and kanojo he and she respectively are genderinflected pronouns
my grandmother was ahead of the curve in that case die butter for example and indistinct pronunciation on the articles all round
yep thats exactly what the author said as it happens i remember studying french at school and being constantly puzzled by the gender system i was always trying to find logic in it and eventually gave up i am now fluent in russian and polish where it almost makes sense
yes because most nouns ending in ung are feminine i dont know if theres a correlation either
i sincerely hope that they dont play around with the german language it needs to be left just as it is german is a very beautiful language it is a language which i am fluent in and yes to achieve that fluency i had to work jolly hard but once the language has been learnt it is very easy to understand why it has three genders were it to lose those genders and become genderneutral the language would lose so much of its clarity and beauty it is my opinion that a language develops as a response to the nature of a people and viceversa fashions that peoples nature as well to speak german well and correctly one has to be very precise one has to be precise about gender verbs adjectival endings etc and many words have to be positioned correctly in the sentence but this surely is the charm of german its beauty lies in its precision it is to be hoped that people leave well alone there is so much to lose by tinkering with such a wonderful language
changing attitudes to gender are increasingly transforming the german language in schwabenländle too
oltermann in german a young lady has no sex while a turnip has the american writer mark twain once complained think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip and what callous disrespect for the girl turnips have sex who knew to be more serious the reason for twains complaint is because ein mädchen is a diminutive of eine magd a maid or maiden and diminutives are neuter the problem isnt genderneutral language for people its the fact that the entire language is built on the classification of nouns as either masculine feminine or neuter to take a sensitive example rape in german is die verwaltigung feminine but that may be more due to german grammar than anything to do with women because the german for police is die polizei
and then theres hungarian where gender does not exist in grammar syntax my mates grandfather a doctor would surprise us all with his tales of being called to the hospital where of a patient he would state and when he fell out of bed he broke her leg yes geza bacsi do tell
der die or das as any student of the german language might know der die or das have little to do with actual sexual gender
many linguists question whether language can be changed through human will if they cant do it with german then there is absolutely no hope for the romance languages
i am continually pointing out to my clients that texts saying the use of he refers to both he and she does not wash in the anglo saxon world are you sure about that pretty much every statute contract or textbook i have ever read has stated references to he includes she
angela merkel will eventually no longer be die bundeskanzlerin but a neutral das bundeskanzler as she would be in english thats a funny sort of english looks more like german to me
just google mark twaingerman the german gendercase system caused the poor man terrible sufferingampnbsp but he got his revenge
chucklingeven as a woman i do not make a big deal of it unless it really is so totally archaic as to be hilarious while the old address for a single female used to be fräulein little woman i just love the idea of a woman referring to a single male as männlein
when i was younger there was a huge fuss about ms the world seemed full of men of a certain age and class making a giant production saying mizzzzzzzz and commenting on how uncouth and unpronounceable it supposedly was wy we still have missmrs as well as ms on forms i dont know why we didnt just make every female mrs the way the germans extended frau i dont know why we need a gendered name prefix at all is not clear to me the japanese seem to manage fine with san for everyone or gendered pronouns at all i seem to remember some sf novel was it by greg egan where the pronoun in english was ve sentences going something like ve threw vis pen at ver by the end of a chapter it read quite easily dare i say naturally
lecturers are advised to address their students not as studenten but studierende only works where there is a corresponding verb in this case studieren to study would not work for say polizist where there is currently no verb equivalent they could invent one i suppose
that will make my life as german english translator a lot easier i am continually pointing out to my clients that texts saying the use of he refers to both he and she does not wash in the anglo saxon world the concept of gender neutral language is foreign to a language that gives male female and neutral genders to objects as well a human beings for example a young girl is an it in german but a young boy is always a he
in low german for example both men and women are simply referred to as de are the endings still different
its hard to transform grammar through legislation said anatol stefanowitsch a linguist at berlins free university if any language can be changed through legislation my guess is that german is the most likely candidate
lecturers are advised to address their students not as studenten but studierende those that study yup thats normal now i use teilnehmende participant and so on it just gets cumbersome especially the duplication kaufmann and kauffrau and so on and also when you have strings of nouns the x the y and the z with different articles genders and then start using reference words for them or even just different cases the use of the form with in makes sense as thats how to cover both
because of his right to freedom of speech its a nasty thing to do but thats life where do you draw the line i find any mention of chelsea fc annoys me its irrational but it does should they ban them to stop me feeling offended you are going to have a bloody long list of things we cant talk about if we go down that route i might be being flippant but micro aggressions are once you start banning things there is only one road you are on
its lucky for you that that word appeared early on and saved you the bother of actually engaging with the article
words are not the same thing as actionsoffence is not physical violence that stands as selfevident for anyone outside certain academic and media circles which have made a huge effort to persuade the society to the opposite the last couple of decades as soon as the author understands these basics she will immediately understand also why this backlash to political correctness is happening
depressing but hardly surprising that this moderate and carefully argued piece should be savaged by the anti pc brigade the central point the writer is making is that we should have the freedom to offend but should think very carefully before doing so as it can have farreaching effects its a simple point of morality that id have thought most people would agree with
the immigration debate is loud on both sides and your side is winning dont worry by the time peoplepoliticians could challange mass immigration without being called racist it was too late thats why we are in this position now here on cif there are still quite a few remainers who think it is racist and xenophobic to even contemplate there may be some negative aspects to mass immigration
was it their dog
from their perspective requests to stop using gay as a pejorative or avoid jokes involving racial stereotypes are about nothing more than protecting the feelings of sensitive snowflakes that is not true and you know it
well owen jones was working class however he then went oxford and had it educated out on him
dont forget that a room with white people in it is a microaggression
a backlash against politically correct language ignores the deeper oppression that unchecked microaggressions inflict on groups such as women and black people i got to the subtitle saw the word microagressions and immediately knew there was no need to read any further the article was going to be one big macroaggression against those of us who believe that being offended now and again is a price worth paying for living in a free society
the two cases are so different that to describe them both as offensive is mistaken it may be offensive to call women ice maidens but it is not offensive to hammer nails through a dogs head its cruel malicious inhumane evil etc
you are arguing for the dumbing down of ideas which are too complex for the masses on the grounds that they are impractical whilst simultaneously arguing against the tyranny of populism i hope nobody would insist that only he and people who agree with him fully understand all the complexities and ramifications of every political issue of the day that would be one hell of a claim what is more likely is that people have differing degrees of ability and inclination to see and understand all the aspects of every issue that is natural and normal
i am free of all prejudice i hate everyone equally
in my experience people who claim that you cant talk about immigration never fucking shut up about immigration by the time peoplepoliticians could challange mass immigration without being called racist it was too late thats why we are in this position now
i think the women came up with the name ice maidens themselves also the loo question is quite interesting given the perils of getting your bits out in sub zero temperatures i hear it is not something to be taken lightly
the freedom not to be offended is more essential than the freedom to be offended by any opinion you dont like however we must adhere to a line whereby if political disagreement becomes foul personal abuse we say stop this is not acceptable for example disliking president trumps political agenda is valid mocking his ethnicity degrading his spouse is too far political correctness in essence is a fine sentiment but the left used it to blanket censor all and every political notion they personally disapproved of such censorship was always going to fail a minority political arrogance was never ever going to silence the majority demographic indefinitely thus political correctness lost its legitimacy not because the people of the uk are intolerant bigots but because the fanatical left abused political correctness to their own invidious end people grew weary of it people turned away from it the guardian and its rabid acolytes of intolerance will not permit political dissent you either slavishly parrot their mantra or you are a racist uneducated fool in this vacuum the guardian readership vs the uk population there can and will be only one victorpoliticallylook toward brexit as undeniable proof in this with  anti brexit tales a week for high on a year now the guardian is just as culpable as any tolerance is a two way street
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening try reading any article on here that deals with certain controversial issues youll see endless this post was removed because it breaches our community guidelines and many of those are simply expressing a political opinion that this paper disagrees with of course the guardian is a private company and do as it pleases with its own site but nonetheless its a good example of an attempt to police speech i am something of a purist on these matters i believe that freedom of speech should be absolute with some very narrow exceptions no threats of violence and suchlike i believe this because freedom of speech and thus the free exchange of ideas and opinions is the fundamental bedrock of our civilization unfortunately the author of this article seems to suggest that she supports freedom of speech unless someones feelings might be hurt by it that im afraid means that she does not believe in freedom of speech though of course she is welcome to advance such an opinion because of the same as for not having real consequences we saw last week a yearold woman and candidate in the stoke byelection arrested for expressing an opinion now i and i believe most people on this site would strongly disagree with her opinion but i cannot accept a situation in which an eccentric woman with unpleasant views is turned into a criminal for speaking her mind
what i have never understood is the notion that the left have a monopoly on the politically correct mrs thatcher notoriously asked of her colleagues is he one of us if not out he went and in thatchers day it was always a he what is that if not intolerance of incorrect political thought a very decent cockney old mate of mine who used to work as a business journalist happened to be a vegetarian not of the preachy type he just didnt want to eat meat he recalls going to a chamber of commerce lunch where he was the only diner to choose the vegetarian option he laughed about the discomfort and controversy he caused among the carnivores sitting with him what is that if not intolerance of the incorrect i used to work for a boss who was likeable enough but repeatedly expressed racist remarks of the milder type i really wanted to challenge him but i was on an insecure contract and i was dependant on him for my livelihood in that context something like i cant see anything wrong with hijabs quite frankly boss would have been decidedly incorrect the right are every bit as intolerant of dissent however mild why isnt this acknowledged
are they moving to the right in droves and all because germaine greer was noplatformed im not sure either of those statements is true
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should my previous message making this point was deleted so perhaps i can rephrase it and hope it is acceptable no you shouldnt act stupidly and be mean to people on the contrary we should be polite and kind as often as possible however if we are always censoring ourselves or being censored for fear of causing offence then we will always be pandering to the people with the lowest offence threshold or more worryingly to the people who can pretend they have the lowest offence threshold most of the twitter storms that are reported in the guardian cannot possibly be genuine examples of people taking offence over such trivia rather people are now aware that by finding something that they can tenuously claim is offensive to some vanishingly small hypothetical community they can be the centre of attention to the twitter mob and perhaps manipulate the actions of someone richer or more powerful than themselves offence requires no evidence no logic and no harm but it is now a powerful enough concept to attack large institutions and respected people it is a dangerous thing to indulge
of course you can no one is afforded a platform by dint of the fact they want one that is true but generally speaking these people are not demanding a platform from people that dont want to give them one instead they are being provided with a platform by one set of people only for a second group to come along and try and take it away those who give the invite are free to rescind it again there generally isnt just one group of people
i suppose you could create a category called nanoaggressions which are like microaggressions but smaller
so katie hopkins is not a preacher of hate whats the distinction
so in your worldview shitting on a table is equal to having views you disagree with
its not polite but otherwise it is nothing to worry about a thick skin is an essential when dealing with other people
the paradox remains that while the principle of freedom of speech is morally defensible much of what is actually said is not where the line is drawn depends on which interest groups you belong to until we can agree on ethical and legal guidelines we will continue to have to tolerate the idiots who think the bigger the insult the more heroically theyre exercising their legal right to freedom of speech the true triumph of reason is that it enables us to get along with those who do not possess it voltaire
merely that people should think about the possible consequences of what they say and the effect they have on others thats wht we need rational debate and not my feelings come first you fucker its a fact that people can be upset by facts
the author wants to prevent aggression against some groups yet fails to realise that political correctness is a gross act of aggression towards the others seeking to silence and demonise them this all boils down to different people holding different opinions and whether some people and some opinions need to be silenced the politically correct say yes and also seek to dictate what may or may not be said
can we all agree that some students tend to talk a lot of bollocks if we agree on that can we also agree that these individuals should be noplatformed i say give them a taste of their own medicine
indeed i find this celebration of covering up and use of the word modest to be deeply bloody insulting if a designer produced a tshirt that said youre a slut thered be uproar from certain quarters yet those same quarters seem to think that cheering on deeply conservative dress styles for women is all good i cant get my head around that one
was there a concerted effort to convince us women kill themselves more than men you mean beyond marriage
is the problem columnists saying offensive crap or that more people are accepting it katie hopkins is offensive that is her thing and we seem to accept it because it is her saying it there is nothing wrong per se with being offensive but take the shit that comes with it i use the word gay as a pejorative no defence it is offensive and wrong which is why i use it in certain company and not in public if someone pulled me on it i wouldnt defend it id agree it was offensive and apologise my friends know that i am using it to be offensive in their company they know it isnt my opinion i do think it has gotten worse just from listening and being aware these past couple of years have seen the rise of people who revel in upsetting other people calling someone a black bastard is the same as calling someone ginger bastard in public i think my main point is that being offensive is fine offending people isnt i have quite a sick and black sense of humour not everyone shares this just accepting this stops me offending people
the left is trying to impose artificial moral norms which havent evolved through society as opposed to traditional moral norms like stoning adulteresses which are so obviously right and good yes the left is trying to change through argument what is seen as appropriate and inappropriate in accordance with reason and higher values thats what anyone with a brain ought to be doing
apart from the results being pretty contradictory you dont get migrants without immigration they are not contradictory as someone else said if ive just had  slices of cheesecake and turn down a th slice it does not mean i hate cheescake
commentators rail against the largely imaginary threat of censorship because its easier than acknowledging that the world doesnt revolve around them replace the word censorship with microaggressions and it would be in my opinion a very valid point to make about you and those who think like you the reason many of us demand views we dislike be freely spoken is because we realise what preventing them from being so actually does prevents them being publicly rebuttedthe only reason i can see why you would not think the same is if you arent so sure you can rebut them and dont want to accept some of your views may be wrong or your ego cant handle someone with opposing views being cleverer than you
restaurants have a code of conduct if you shit on their tables you get kicked outuniversities have a code of conduct if you say offensive dumb trolling shit you get kicked outwhats the problem with discrimination against individuals when its deserving we have no problem locking serial killers up
very true you cannot have a democracy without freedom of speech but i do get the feeling that those who wish to curtail it have definite ideas about who should be in charge ie them and they shouldnt allow awkward thinks like votes get in the way this is the way it always starts
ooo everyone who disagrees with me is the kind of person orwell warned us about do better
microaggressions how very buzzfeed
hate crime involves any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a personal characteristic hate crime can be motivated by disability gender identity race religion or faith and sexual
to mise evelyn hall not voltaire i disapprove of what you say but i will do nothing to defend your right to say it
but be honest people have been sent to prison for a torrent of repeated tweets serious credible threats to life and limb including the brutal rape torture and dismemberment of their victims their victims friends and children lets not pretend that just because the threats are too foul to publish in a newspaper that they are not criminal
rad fems the least radical people on the planet want all women to look dress and act the same be entirely uniform in a way that only they must say more patriarchal than the most control freak patriarch hubby father boss
well take it up with councils that have decided to change the names of christmas fetes etc this is the kind that drives people crazy i think theres a govt list of things you can and cant say to disable people and having a disable sister i would only be offended by one of the items on the list httpswwwgovukgovernmentpublicationsinclusivecommunicationinclusivelanguagewordstouseandavoidwhenwritingaboutdisability wasnt there a story the other day about doctors are now told to say expectant person rather than expectant mother
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening theres quite a lot of evidence of some people trying to make it happen telling such people where to get off can only be a good thing
there is a level of degree in this i thinkqueer was the word that was used by people who were about to beat you up often or if not at least publically humiliate and shun you many many gay men in the uk had their teenage and school years ruined by it feeling totally excluded and often physically threatenedwhilst i accept that some young people now have decided to copy the american use of the word and use it to describe themselves that is their right i do not accept the media adopting it as a catchall term to describe the rest of us they would never do that for the n word and for me the q word is just as upsetting
google liam stacey racist and very unpleasant no doubt but nothing to do with antiterror reactionism he was also suspended from his university if that makes it relevent enough to campus politics
as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing i envy most ordinary people because the vast majority have never heard of terms or phrases like unchecked microaggressions or noplatforming have no idea who or what milo yiannopoulos and breitbart and simply dont think or care about privilege intersectionality or any of the rest of the babble that has done such absolutely sterling work in turning ordinary people away from parties of the left attempt to police their language will of course accelerate this process
the lazy thing to do at this point would be to point to john stuart mills distinction between speech that harms and that which merely offends if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear orwell
the freedom to offend is an unavoidable corollary of freedom of speech if im allowed to say what i like then you might not like what i say offending people intentionally and gratuitously like katie hopkins and donnie trump is very bad manners but shouldnt be against the law
agree with your points that exactly
where does it say that she feels nonprogressives are stupid another paper tiger are you projecting your own feelings of inadequacy on to the arguments of people who simply think youre wrongthe sneering leftie intellectual is a paper tiger erected by people who think they have a right to challenge everyone else but that no one has a right to challenge them
just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should of course it doesnt but nor does it mean someone should be arrested for verbally insulting someone
and were there any arguments that a remainer could put forward that would penetrate your mental barriers good point i am no different to most in that its not easy to change ones opinion immediately i was a gentle brexiter and i could have been pro eu if the remain arguments had not been  focussed on the economy if remainers were not talking with the stance that everyone else is thick and if i had thought the eu was capable of even wanting to reform to reflect changing circumstances
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening apart from people going to prison for offensive tweets or being pressured to resign by this very paper for making a clumsy self deprecating joke as the opening of a speech to name just two open your eyes
absolute bullshit the immigration debate is loud on both sides and your side is winning dont worry this is what pisses me off so much the pc brigade is portrayed as these always the victims groups moaning and morally superior youre just the same your side of the debate is not being shut down grow up and realise when youre winning too
doublethink
yes the guardian seems to have decided that the fact that grime and beyoncé dont get every music award going is clear racism it doesnt seem to occur them that the a lot people just find grime and beyoncé boring
so this guy everyones talking about milo at one of his events he plastered the photo of a transgender student on the screen and made fun of them in front of the entire university would you defend his right to do that
the left is trying to impose artificial moral norms which havent evolved through society which dont have general acceptance and or which fly in the face of every day experience gender equality multiculturalism the inherently peaceful nature of islam the objective reality of transgenderism etc debating them is not about rudeness or political incorrectness it is about being able to present your version of reality which is surely a fundamental human right if the word means anything at all the left can be as rude and offensive as it likes about traditional culture christianity and the people who support it be they black white men women straight or gay so it is completely obvious that pc is a tactic to close down debate even people who see themselves as part of a left sanctioned aggrieved group can fall foul of this as hillary clinton found in her  run against obama it was quite satisfying to see the soixante huiter generation of feminists fall foul of the liberal machine so much so that hillary ended up thanking fox news for its balanced coverage during that primary this is clearly a fear of free speech and for obvious reasons you didnt get milo until he violated traditional mores after all
yes it is all your fault with your incessant manspreading 
supposing i say to a religious person that god does not exist that person might feel offended whereas i would merely be stating my belief could it be construed as causing offence or being insulting or what 
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged classprivileged you should try to substantiate that claim because it doesnt sit with the claim that working class people and the underclass voted for trump
very well said pick of the day
oh and the fact that driving these people and their views underground doesnt actually get rid of them it just hides them engaging with them is much more productive youre not going to convince anyone that gay marriage is okay by just insisting that theyre not allowed to say otherwise
the reason that phrase is trotted out is that it refers to a specific court case in the usa that helped define the limits of freedom of speech there so its not just an example its a reference to something directly relevant in future when you read it hopefully youll now begin to understand the context oh and as it happens the court case was in  so its entirely relevant to the th century
when schools start banning novels this is when we really have to start worrying about the return of facism i think httpswwwtheguardiancombooksdectokillamockingbirdremovedvirginiaschoolsracistlanguageharperlee
was there a concerted effort to convince us women kill themselves more than men
maybe there are some communities as mean and miserable as you describe but my reality when im out and about my everyday life is that people are surprisingly kind polite and genuinely helpful obviously are exceptions but mostly im surprised by the kindness of strangers rather than their hostility perhaps im just lucky
commentators rail against the largely imaginary threat of censorship because its easier than acknowledging that the world doesnt revolve around them really imaginary you say do you read newspapers books like huck finn and to kill a mockingbird have been banned in schools and public libraries speakers invited to public debates have been no platformed riots have broken out whilst police hid none of these are imaginary how long should people wait until they say ok thats enough after  books are banned i find many things about religion objectionable and not just merely microaggressively may i demand these offensive bits be excised im offended after all
yes im actually a virtual construct
the fact that it ends up backed up by laws and that one day the people in control of making and enforcing the laws wont have the same idea of what should and should not be allowed to be said as they do now hand over control of what can be said and the legal means of enforcing it to the government and then watch what happens when someone like trump gets in
what about people who cant tolerate any opinion other than their own and do resort to breastbeating posts like yours in a blatant attempt to shame opponents into shutting up ah good old hypocrisy
ill say this the call the deny peter tatchell from a university speaking platform because of his views on the wedding cake thing were frighteningly extreme and strident the author has a point but it seems to me that there is a very fine line between calling out hate speech and silencing differing opinions it would probably help if we looked less at the words people used and more at the emotional tone used even there there are difficulties should that australian fremist woman whose name escapes me be denied a voice purely because she doesnt see trans women as women or because she was abusive about the way she expressed her opinion seems to me the middle way is in not denying opinions but in calling out and not denying aggressive and rude speech in our debating dont shut people up set boundaries
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed when i was a student back in the early s i had a lot of holidayjobs in factories i can asssure the writer that unless things have changed greatly class is not a factor in racism
maybe i read the article incorrectly but i never got the feeling abi was saying that speech should be controlled merely that people should think about the possible consequences of what they say and the effect they have on others for me the key word is think something we as humans seem to struggle with at the moment we already live in a world where facts are under threat so too reason logic and analysis emotion has become king it seems sure its easy to offend someone but what does it really benefit me and should i enjoy offending someone then what does it say about me as a person
this is an interesting thread please to all involved dont turn it into a remainbrexit argument
people such as yourself who think they have intrinsically more intelligence than plebs very rarely listen to plebs it is not in your nature thats what i mean by watt
is physical harm worse than psychological harm many would disagree speech is an act it can be incredibly harmful and destructive if you cant understand this youve had a very privileged existence which might have made you exceedingly naive and not a little callous
indeed ive long seen many modern liberals as actual backdoor social conservatives they still want to control peoples speech beliefs what they do in the bedroom etc just with slightly different motives and different targets
so what valid reasons are there for opposing political correctness ive seen many reasons put forward all of them turned out to be bollocks come on give me your best shot
this is a hard issue but one that needs to be addressed urgentlyif all people have intrinsic value and deserve respect and acknowledgement we have to include respect for their sincerely held beliefs values and opinions and the right to express and live by them even if we do not share them or strongly disagree with them at the same time our own value and right to respect and acknowledgement means we should be able to expect respect for our beliefs values and opinions and to be able to express our disagreementon the other hand we are all shaped by the beliefs values and opinions that frame our groups and societies and the behaviour expectations and law within them there are some ideas like believing our nation or race is superior to others which inevitably create behaviour expectation and even law that prevents at least some people from being able to live a decent valued and valuable life or at worst condemns those people to appalling treatment there are lots of examples of societies which persecute some of their members based on poisonous ideas about them some persecution is subtle and implicit some is violent and expliciti abhor the tory mantra of british values but there is a germ of an idea there perhaps we do need to choose to thoroughly reject some obviously poisonous ideas that create danger for some or all members of our society it has to be unacceptable to deny the value of every person and their right to respect and human dignity by extension the universal declaration of human rights defines the framework in which an open fair and decent society can exist perhaps we do have to say that it is unacceptable to promote and express ideas that are in open conflict to those make no mistake there are people who hate the idea of universal human rights by definition they do not believe in freedom of speech or anything else but are happy to exploit the rights our society gives them to overthrow it if the rest of us believe in those rights we have to be prepared to fight for them by insisting that they are upheld and applied for all citizens given that we see the idea of universal human rights openly attacked every day by sections of the uk press by prominent columnists by at least one significant political party and even by government ministers we have a lot of work to do very quickly
descriptive words to describe groups dastardlypontificatorsjuvenile this already shows a bias derogatory descriptions of people with opposing views these are used to silence people inferring that their opinions are irrelevant or less worthy but in fact is also a construct to divert blame andor get rid of dissent introduced into mainstream policy by the last elected labour pm with help from his press secretary here is the problem it has created division under a pretense of righteousness frankly it is time people were told suck it up buttercup and let all people speak without fear ref microaggressions try being an older white man apparently i am to blame for all the ills of the planet because of my age gender and skin colour
ive never met any of those people and it wasnt referring to this subject but to those who people who despise political correctness usually want to rail against race relations gay rights gender equality etc or talk about them
yes executive decisions as regards what would appear to impinge profoundly on the solidity of the current liberal orthodoxy quite startling really but taken to be an indicator of triumph by one side or at least vindication on tge free speech battleground while suggesting that the wider culture war has some way to run note trump on transgender toilets today this is bannons strike back
the pontificators are joined by a bevy of rightleaning politicians and an army of juvenile internet trolls are the people arguing for political correctness joined by any unpleasant people as far as i can tell most ordinary people remain largely unfazed by the whole thing possibly because beyond a handful of overexposed incidents involving university students its hard to identify what the supposed threat actually consists of so noone is much bothered and nothing bad ever happens according to you but are those handful of incidents that we here about all that happen and are they really harmless tim hunt and matt taylor might want to have a word with you about that i cant claim to be a neutral voice on this issue though i think its important that dissenting speech should be formally protected i also tend to see efforts to make language more inclusive as a positive thing more inclusive for all or just those you decide are groups that should enjoy additional protections in society i cant say i remember many of your articles so i dont know student activists dont have the ability to stop highprofile journalists writing what they damn well please im not sure thats the point trying to censor people is generally considered wrong unless that person is doing something illegal with their speechwords you seem to have a problem with people criticising pc culture but for the most part such criticism will not stop those pushing for it being published or protesting so this part of your reasoning can be applied to them as well censorship by the left is at most a paper tiger you say that but i think it might be more because youve not been on the receiving end of the social shaming tacticspressure that it involves take a moment and think about how it would feel to be labelled racist or a rape apologist for something that youve said when youve said nothing of the sort does it feel nice is being labelled as such harmless another piece of research found that girls as young as six believe intellectual brilliance is a male trait and a different study small one found that girls believe that then are bettercleverer than boys by the age  and boys believe the same by age  so its not as simple as you might want to make out is it no single droplet causes the flood but throwaway jokes and comments microaggressions in the much derided parlance of social justice activism add up to a climate of hostility that makes life significantly harder for members of targeted groups but are you going to be consistent in this or are you going to make exceptions to allow certain groups to be targeted because you think that they do not deserve the same protection if you want to go doubt the route of pc culture then it can be easily turned against the very people who champion it its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed it seems you might be wanting to make exceptions whats the suicide rate for men again like it or not if you argue that people deserve protection from bad words you cant then go but not those people over there their groups not been historically oppressed suddenly certain individuals can be targets what you would define as harmful behaviour i just doubt youd include yourself in the acceptable targets category shouldnt we be looking to protect all individuals from harmful behaviour define oppression for us werent the irish oppressed by the english sure it wasnt due to their skin colour but it was along ethnic lines casting all critics as authoritarian and censorious artificially polarises the debate but these critics are claiming a right to power and want the ability to police the language that everyone uses it might make you uncomfortable to be defined in such as way but its accurate and if theyyou can achieve there policing of language then its an indication that they have real power in society
im gonna upvote this cause this is actually funny in a messed up sort of way
au contraire i heard them all then decided theyre ridiculous no you didnt people such as yourself who think they have intrinsically more intelligence than plebs very rarely listen to plebs it is not in your nature you might see their lips moving but are saying shit shit shit in your mind rather than actually listening and seeking to understand
kind of a different kettle of fish since that was down to antiterror reactionism not campus politics
what is mo
freedom of speech doesnt mean freedom from the consequences of speech if you say certain things you can be taken to court because they are outside the law if they are found to be legal you can carry on saying them if they are found to be illegal you should refrain from saying them in the future and will be punished in the present that seems to me to be the best way to deal with such issues in a society supposedly governed by the rule of law we dont want to go down some orwellian  route to newspeak after all that would be double plus ungood
also the political correctness gone mad brigade are just as numerous just as shrill and annoying and just as politically motivated as the pc brigade yet they dont get criticised in the same way social justice warriors are often referred to as white knights on the internet like they are on some kind of moral crusade and also because they want to be seen as moralistic and superior i dont deny they exist but i think the pc gone mad brigade are exactly the same theyre after the attention they want the recommends and updates theyre after the morally superior badge theyre worse in my opinion because at least the pc brigade are highlighting real problems theyve just taken it too far and lost sight of things the other side effectively just want to maintain tb status quo and their own individual position
yeah it went a bit to far into control freakery territory you are making people walk on eggshells in the work place an accidental brush past a female becomes an horrific life altering sexual assault a comment about the awful state of dress of a cross dressing man becomes a national news worthy attack on personal freedoms a comment about the fact that  of children in the class dont speak english becomes a sacking offence due to horrendous discrimination and a request to remove religious jewelry to abide by the dress code becomes a national high court battle for freedom of religious expression
the debate about freedom of speech has been won its bizarre that is those who call themselves progressive are now the most censorious among us it is only bizarre if you are completely ignorant of the history of leftwing movements in the th century
yes but a fairly pedantic one
the one type of journalist not allowed in the guardian is a working class one i dont take offence though i cant be bothered to get that annoyed about something so pointless
two recent local news items  a group of women are planning to trek to the north pole known as the ice maidens my local news found it appropriate to ask how they had a pee in such a cold climate  two men one  and the other  have been convicted of hammering a nail six times through a dogs head and burying it alive needless to say it died in misery pain and terror item  offends because of the term ice maidens and also because all that was thought to be important was to ask how they had a piss item  describes actions so offensive that it is doubtful whether or not the men are human beings
insignificant in statistics doesnt mean unimportant as in everyday speech
denne
less than  of the population have a heart attack each year insignificant
whats wrong with theygive me an example in which hen would be used where they is grammatically incorrectand then do it in swedish where the word for they is denne 
too much time to think too little to do
we have they it has arrived interestingly the oed notes this use has sometimes been considered erroneous but gives as its earliest example one from  so anybody wishing to contest it has  years of use to contend with and basically outs themselves as a sexist dinosaur i recently noticed myself using it in a context where all the people referred to were male if someone wants to bring along an extra bag they can i wasnt trying to be genderless it is apparently the neutral term to refer from members of a group in my mental grammar
they are definitely useful when presenting to groups of men and women and its better to use a gender neutral pronoun rather than he or she or worse she etc
han is the finnish word they dont have an equivalent for he or she
its about not using a gender based rd person pronoun when referring to people who could be male or female or whatever a number of languages have this kind of construct finnish for example which has no rd person gender at all
what if they dont agree with the predominance of the term being in the history of western philosophy and would like to replace it with something else
or sheesh
the best thing to do is have a couple of whiskeys and read these comments absofuckinglutely hilarious
apologies dimmu are norwegian
much of sweden is the same latitude as scotland so hardly arctic dimmu borghir are icelandic and the issue isnt just about transgender people but as the article clearly states the speaker or writer deems the gender to be superfluous information
good for them now if only english speakers could stop arguing about the merits of theythem as a neutral pronoun
why not hun sounds affectionate
arent swedes those vegetables
law what law
problem is that human being is supposed to describe us as distinguished from other animals by superior mental developmentlooking at what mankind is capable of i sometimes wonder if that definition applies to our specieslets just forget that surrogate pronoun
it comes off as brash and makes people sound lesser than human like theyre an object not a person
what about heesh for heshe it quite trips off the tongue
isnt some version of it es in german already available on swedish
i dont think they should all be called swedes in case some of them dont define themselves by nationality or as human beings in case thats speciesist maybe just beings
does that include youinsignificant
the imams in malmo are not going to like this
roughly what percentage of people identify as neither male nor female
is it the arctic winters giving birth to very interesting but still marginal bands like dimmu borghir most people love to express themselves through their gender what is the percentage being accomodated by this law anything below  is statistically speaking insignificant
the gender neutral service to french was provided by my school several decades ago our french french teacher used to complain that instead of saying un or une we would say uh le or la we would luh il or elle we would say uhl we await our collective légion dhonneur for services to the french language 
why get that uppity why not just call ourselves mammals or my favourite selfactuating oxycarbohydronitrocalciphosphosulfursodichlorimagnesium plus trace elements biped units
didnt know that thank you problem solved i shall add it to my lexicon of proper english which my nonenglish work colleagues expect me to have mastered if only they knew 
she sell sanctuary
some transgender people transit to a gender neutral middle ground others who havent transgendered or migrated are happier in a gender neutral zone but the point as steveyates points out above to give speakers the option of not assigning gender where to do so would make assumptions they dont want to make
very true yes yet for me there is something elegant and elemental in remembering that we are simply human beings its a reminder of who we are rather than the what man woman
well someone is utterly totally daft alright look what just happened to me for no reason whatsoever ffs these things just get on ones nerves acutehumortransplanturgentlyneeded
hen or hän sovspape
i know sweden and swedish well and i find the proposed use of hen silly partly because it makes you think of the english meaning of hen the bird but also and especially because of the grammatical mistakes and confusions that are bound to arise if hen is permitted perhaps preferred and isnt hen a finnish word anyway rather than swedish
pedantry alert dem ltgt them ie objectde ltgt they ie subjecthowever both are usually just pronounced dom in speechcan be a source of confusion often to swedes as well
hen heshe is meant to replace the cumbersome hanhon heshe when you dont know if someone is a man or women or between
they should just come out and admit theyre inspired by their more linguistically liberal neighbours hän
in this case accidentally accurate since jonsid as we know it is just an entity moniker avatar persona etc or a bot 
no if you read dom you say dom dom is the relaxed everyday way to say de or dem to successfully learn the difference of de or dem is very tricky for newbeginners not even all swedes themselves learn the right way to use them so all you new beginners please use dom instead for dedem and you will be always right i guess the sfi wants to teach the correct way first and when you got that they introduce dom as how everyone speaks it the dom is slang for dedem but everyone says dom in everyday speak de or dem is for text purpose or if you are a politician on tv
bit of an oxymoron there
good idea but why relate it to transgender individuals who by definition are not genderneutral that sounds less progressive than recognising a persons chosenselfidentified gender third sexintersex may be different
dom is a tricky one i am a beginner at the language and was told that if you see dom in text you should say de just checked with my swedish girlfriend and she says that most people actually write dem
dont do it youll look like a fool
the swedes failed social experiment marches proudly on
its not that the person is gender neutral its that the speakers assumption can now be gender neutral it avoids constructions that assume one or other gender like a ceo runs a company and he reports to the board
nor mine
as in jonsid is a commenter on cif it made a comment today
snowflake pronoun or name as they are sometimes known
i think its all very sauna based
what happens if someone is gender neutral but slightly leans toward one gender not enough to qualify for hen but neither do they feel that they are han or hon
they could have reindeer partiels a bit like mooses only scaled down
not at my sfi school
human beings are though much longer than heshe not effectively
the evolution of the swedish language is usually based on actual colloquial speech and very sensible when i learnt swedish the word for they was de but it was pronounce dom they now accept dom in written form
as long as they stick with three that should be fine unlike some who wish us to adopt a galaxy of new pronouns and get pissed when someone doesnt call them by their special snowflake pronoun
good idea but we already have an equivalent in english it i daresay someone will find this unacceptable though
see sells sea shells on the sea shore
dont they have hen parties moose parties or is that for blokes all very confusing these swedish premarital traditions
unless youre swedish when it doesnt
theyre just copying their neighbours all finnish pronouns are gender neutral hän covers both he and she finns sometimes find the distinction confusing my wife used to call everybody see see said that see would ring again later
i think this is a good move but dont we already have a word in universal usage that references males and females human beings why make it more complicated
ach weve hud hens in scotland since afore pronouns wiz invented
not just colloquially googling singular they reveals its use by shakespeare austen the authorized version etc
i have thought about he and i shall dismiss he out of hand
colloquially we can use they and their in english as it is indefinite in both number and gender much more elegant than she and the rest of it luckily we dont need a language academy to make the change just consistent and polite usage will do the trick 
great idea
sounds female as in hen party
not really if you think about it rather than dismiss it out of hand
good for those who need or want it genderneutral terms are always useful and those who dont want to use it dont have to
bloody daft
blokes are buddy
peak guardian
prefer chaps grown up even if fixing the car
looottttt of confused angry men in these comments huh
sorry you are offended dearie next time you pop into a shop for innocuous normal reasons and they have a pinup of a guy who is wondrously endowed with next to nothing covering it up im sure youd not feel in the slightest uncomfy especially if the shop assistant was a bit leery of course youd feel that was something you didnt need to worry your pretty head about etc
thank god you survived that living hell
ive read quite a lot of women on this thread saying theyre fine with girl and so on actually i dont think this is a men versus women thing i think its a where do you sit on the whole pc and offence issue thing
i guess he didnt
in a shop in yorkshire so its a bit of a weird one because i dont really mind hey lass even though its basically the same thing as hey girl because again the customers saying hey lass will also say hey lad also the hey isnt really an oi type hey its more akin to a hello greeting
i call people of both genders loveand women i know well girlsits a term of endearment but from now on princess is on trend
im some years older today a woman in her s assistant in tesco called me love i dont care its her mannerism not an intended slight or comment on me being old
now even germaine greer is not permitted to speak her mind well thats some compensation at least
im  and part of various different and interrelated groups of male friends we tend to refer to ourselves without irony as the boys or the lads when i refer to a women in similar gender specific terms i do so in exactly the same spirit as when im talking about men
no coming from an area where the term was never used as i was growing up i feel slightly irritated and uncomfortable when addressed as mate by strangers almost as bad as being called jimmyunfortunately the usage seems to be almost ubiquitous now and theres nothing i can do but accept it
father christmas i am outraged
i am a woman in  i began training in the engineering field and worked in allmale except for the secretarial staff who were called girls offices for the next  years one man said to me you are not a girl so what do i call you i suggested he call me by my name my children rolled their eyes when i said i found the term girl demeaning then one daughter aged  said she was reading a book called the girl on the train and was half way through still wondering who the girl was oh she finally caught on the woman on the train
when i was twenty five someone told me to smile it might never happen a couple of days before my father died in hospital i thought he was really rude and insensitive different if hed asked if i was ok why make comments like that i wouldnt think of it
rape forcible confinement gross indecency that is the kind of stuff we have several hollywood figures accused of on the other hand we dont all live in or know people from hollywood
i can really understand that also it is illuminating in a depressing kind of way just reading the thread the few womens voices articulating their reality are just drowned out by misogynist banter
yes anywhere except for in liverpool it is rude in liverpool it is normal colloquial speech and not meant offensively
is that going to stop you going for promotion if so then you are holding yourself back
people who talk about virtue signaling or peak offence or who get offended whenever someone suggests an improvement in the way we deal with each other are usually those who are too lazy or selfish to consider doing anything to make others feel better in the few short years we cling to this rock in space on the other hand people could relax more and not get so easily offended that too would make life easier and funnier too
i wouldnt be petty over it if i lived in an equal society where i wasnt going to spend my life getting paid less than men and being asked irritating questions about when im going to ruin everything by having a baby and being told that i clearly wont stay in the job i do because its not family friendly my partner who does the same job but is a guy never gets told that and if i lived in a country where if i did have a baby i wouldnt have a one in  chance of being forced out of my job because i was pregnant and where i didnt get to be one of the  in  women whove been sexually harassed at work but when you do operate in that environment being called love in a patronising manner in a professional context is really very grating its not the term its just a proxy marker for the frustrating sexist society we live in
could be just you if youre female
god yes have always cringed when ive hear girls night out same as what goes on at ladies night stays at ladies night or whatever no thanks
you sound like a very nice lady
it is a totally cynical exercise look at how many comments and views the previous and identical article made then just rinse and repeat then claim with breathtaking piety that the daily mail generates hate as opposed to what the guardian generates reader trolling is pathetic from whichever quarter it comes the graun would do better to rise above it but it is part of the modus these days
where does jacks indicate that shehe is offended the point being made as i understand it is that somebody who is determined to be offended will be no matter what anybody else does sorry to be offensive by writing shehe perhaps i should have used the old tarzan catchall word ungowa
different generation
mary whitehouse would be so proud of the new puritans
i stopped being a girl in my early s and have dislike the term ever since i dont mind it as much if the man is over  years old because then the age gap is significant and i must really seem like a girl to someone that age however as im now in my s it is nails down a blackboard when a man that is either my age or just a few years older calls me girl i did not appreciate a boss calling me and even his supervisors princess david brent much he stopped though when i told him that none of us liked it obviously it does depends on context as well and on the person saying it for example i particularly dont like girl in the workplace or by a health professional like a dentist
do you have many friends
the old testament definitely doesnt
someone touched me once when they called me boyo ive never got over it do you think i could sue them for the cost of therapy
in all seriousness i dont mean this as patronising snark i think its not healthy to treat something that minor and arbitrary as some kind of challenge to your masculinity most women dont say mate its just a random language thing
this article was designed perfectlyto enrage
people who talk about virtue signaling or peak offence or who get offended whenever someone suggests an improvement in the way we deal with each other your problem is the assumption that this idiocy is somehow an improvement
i said hello to my niece using her name a couple of weeks ago and she furiously told me she wasnt that she was a dinosaur she was dressed up as one kids are bonkers
you can see why women give up people do not say it to men if someone said it to me i would tell them to fuck off
my lord how petty have we all become in the words of that profound intellectual don henley all this whinin and cryin and pitchin a fit get over it get over it
the way we organise ourselves as a reproductive species please explain the nuclear family is a social religious construct as a reproductive species our biological construct of family can take on many forms this is why many cultures have extended families live under one roof or litters of children or multiple spouses in biological terms we shouldnt even have the time or lack of passion in our lives to sit around being paid  for one article about observational terms based on a persons anatomical sex
oh rebecca just picking my wife up from a girls night out find something important to get upset about
in the uk there is nothing holding women back except women themselves so at work when i found out my senior male colleagues were ranking me and other females in our workplace based on our boobs my problem wasnt the menbut the other women for having boobs either inferior or superior to mine that required ranking

should i make an issue out of it it is possible you just did
so the new testament teaches us
ltblockeyoure the one taking unnecessary offence heregt no i am not if they called me mate or mucker or something like that it wouldnt bother me its the laziness which pisses me off the language is entirely female babe honey precious it is entirely acceptable in female to female interactions when it is brought into female to male interactions it is totally inappropriate and actually quite offensive i have never been a babe i dont look anything like a babe and i am certain that i will never ever be a babe so why call me one
yes but noone uses men as an informal term i guess thats the difficult bit theres no potentially non offensive informal equivalent for women
well ive never spent any time looking at a guardian thread before but it seems to me a lot of misogynist old arseholes here have a great deal of trouble holding it in
i like the welsh term lovely its not smarmy like love its simply saying youre a lovely person
to be fair i have said that many times to both men and womeni dont think that asking someone to smile is a term used only at women i have also heard women use that term when speaking to men at work
i love love darling sweetie and other such sweet words
what are little boys made ofslugs and snails and puppy dogs tailsthats what little boys are made of and she thinks shes got it bad
the beatings will just continue dont fall for any false hope
or cock in london or is that just me
dont be silly you can not be sexist against men repeat after the guardian men are not victims they are always perpetrators
sweatheart sounds like a precursor to a heart attack all that totty better watch out
guardian writers trying to out do each other in finding things to be offended by says someone offended by a suggestion of improved manners god forbid we should try to make everyone we meet comfortable and unpatronized people who talk about virtue signaling or peak offence or who get offended whenever someone suggests an improvement in the way we deal with each other are usually those who are too lazy or selfish to consider doing anything to make others feel better in the few short years we cling to this rock in space
i wont say it sorebecca nicholson your photo posted with this article make you look quite there i havent said it
not really im old every day
right so women using that language are being nice and i shouldnt let it grate on my nerves but when men use similar language it is demeaning no only the bit up to the comma and frankly you seem to be the sort of person you object to youre talking about a perfectly normal thing to call people and saying it really really pisses me off youre the one taking unnecessary offence here
there is nothing wrong with love if it is used indiscriminately
never mind love
as a female i used to battle a lot with men asking me to cheer up or smile literally when i was just going through my day opening doors thinking about when to next clean my car looking for a pen lid or trying to hold in a fart or something the one time i bothered to turn around and explain my offense and that i shouldnt have to project certain emotions on cue just because someone interpreted my facial expression incorrectly the man in question work colleague got so offended he didnt talk to me for a week not really worth pointing out when youre offended i learned one offended person can get over themselves two offended people will fall out
or just dont speak to anyone ever that way youre safe probably
rebecca your hair cut is so girlyprincess this might be encouraging people to call you girl instead of epsilon or gamma just a thought
indeed though i cant help thinking a big part of trumps appeal to many was his refusal to be bullied like this same with the owner of the washington redskins who responded to his own lynch mob with a quite magnificent contempt in the present climate there is great power in the refusal to apologise
how about bingo bingo
when i recently said you my youngest granddaughter hello little bearshe was a bit indignant claiming she was not a bear but a girl
i live in devon im  most days various females will refer to me as darling lover honey buddy sweetheart i am entirely unbothered is that a word i have never felt patronised matronised and actually quite like itshould i make an issue out of it
oh come on theyre being nice right so women using that language are being nice and i shouldnt let it grate on my nerves but when men use similar language it is demeaning i am getting to the point where its probably better not to interact at all because no matter what you do no matter how you conduct yourself you are wrong and you will always be wrong even when you point out obvious contradictions you are wrong again
depends on context really the girls and the boys as friendly shorthand for workplace social groups seem to be fine its not like people actually address each other as boy or girl outside of the us or east anglia
superb stuff
in liverpool if someone says duckyou duck i thought that was manchester are you from manchester
no they deserve assuming they are white of course for which i should be shot
arent we all now guys hi guys
not really theyre used by strangers to each other too
as what exactly if its someone who doesnt like sexism youre right if its someone who likes football youre wrong
the most toxic gender construct in society and this is the problem the looney right are actually correct about the insidious feminist agenda promulgated by a small but powerful group of people fundamentally opposed to the way we organise ourselve as a reproductive species these people need to be fucked off not all women are self hating and not all men are prepared to neuter themselves
its all good fun to be honest
how about fellow human being as in greetings
in the workplace women may not feel able to tell you it bothers them that is the problem its also unprofessional you can do what you like in your personal life but i think very poorly of people who use this it suggests they never grew up

ah gotcha thanks for the translation i have never ever been the secretary of state for defence but then im an incorrigible kneetoucher
addressing women as girls is a reverseirony way of avoiding the implication that they are getting on a bit as would be implied by using the term ladies its nothing to do with being patronising
seems kind of pointless to force little milly to go to school and forget she is a girl when in most cases she is returning home to the most toxic gender construct in society the nuclear family little milly has two older brothers mummy and daddy are just so happy their third and final child was a girl as they always dreamed of a having a beautiful little princess who can take horseriding lessons and bake cakes in her fisher price kitchen
imo calling someone a boy in a working context is bad too if i was in a position of power at work i wouldnt call men boy any more than i would call women girl would the ceo of a multinational accept being called boy or girl by hisher subordinates of course not and that shows that its a power thing
thats the one line in the piece that had a grain of truth
it is the snowflake pc brigade getting their genderneutral underwear in a twist for no good reason that is horrifici am a male old about  years ago for the first time that i can remember in my life i put my underpants that means male underwear in uk if youre american on backtofrontit was very inconvenient and uncomfortable
i know of one workplace where theres an absolutely pervasive problem with bullying emanating from the antibullying committee
ps this is not helped when people wear name badges etc pinned to their chests and you attempt to read them
i think passive aggressive offencetaking should be recognised as a form of abusive behaviour yes yes yes im only sorry i can only give you one recommend this should be a guardian pick
my mum refers to her friends as the girls and they are all in their s i personally never call women girls but i am a bit camp and so call everyone love darlin or babe regardless of age or gender i think its as much the tone context and perceived intent as the words themselves that can cause offence but a man calling female colleagues girls is asking for trouble

so i guess we should start adjusting anthems to become politically correct even though they are hundreds of years old and are a part of national identity and dont even get me started on languages which dont really follow feministic whims i remember some time ago when a group of feminists in poland wanted to enforce feminine forms of certain jobs like a minister which in polish is masculine only which obviously didnt work
i like a nice cup of tea in the morning and a nice cup of tea with my tea and my ideal of heavenor is it there is a nice little dog behind the window
the conclusion about turkey is interesting because try as i may i cant remember a single gender reference in it the french one also surprised me because i had the opposite impression though i like the anthem itself but now that i think about it it is true the militaristic tone confused me
what no mention of the barbadian anthem we loyal sons and daughters alldo hereby make it knownthese fields and hills beyond recallare now our very own
i dont actually mean that one now ive got that song in my head this is the one i meant i did a quick google searchhttpswwwacousticmusicarchivecomenglishcountrygardenchordslyrics
but srrriously guysneutral dont you think the more ridiculous the topic of the article the more enjoyable the comments thus engendered
i dont think it is the song you mean but you did take me back to my questionablyspent youth and what do you do when you go to the loo in an english country garden i really dont think that you meant that song i do recall all the words i believe if anyone feels in need of a refresher 
thanks for letting me know still its reassuring to hear that im not the only one with this opinion
there isnt officially but it might as well be thats partly why i hate it the rest of the home nations have their own its time we updated ours its not the s anymore and we dont dominate the seas 
attaching genitals to the transcendental god is disgustingly pagan and blasphemous for the christians and for the moslems as well
i didnt realise there is such a thing as an english national anthem the english rugby team was singing the one for the whole of the united kingdom but that one doesnt go down well in the other constituent nations we have our own semi official ones we much prefer
as far as australia is concerned i would rather waltz with matilda than with the seasidedwelling gert
equality all the way but cmon waste of space of an article whats next gender inequality in toothpaste adverts and of course clean infographic just for it why not anthems are outdated who cares
thank you very much going to sit down and read it now
i hate our national anthem i would much rather it be that song about an english country garden you know the one i mean dont know the name
the canadian anthem o canada was originally written in french and was an anthem of the canadien as opposed to the british conquerors and their god save the king the english translated it and appropriated it and so it doesnt mean that much to the former canadiens now mainly called quebecois it became a political anthem when played before hockey matches the french part was booed in english canada quebec has since the ies its own anthem called gens du pays the english canadians wont steal that one
that even holds connotations though there should be just one title
no the australian anthem was changed years ago
égorgez vos fils vos compagnes slit the throats of your sons and your womenfolk
god save the queen ticks the underrepresentedgender box while simultaneously managing to include those of a minority sexual orientation oh yes and monster raving royalists triple tick
someone put this rather better hours ago sorry
you can use the ms if you dont want to change between miss and mrs
many people simply havent seen the first verse i love a sunburnt country goes quite nicely to the church has one foundation its in a standard hymn metre
this is a parody right its the guardian showing it can make a joke at itself at times it slips into confusion or a blur over grammatical gender and sexual gender a problem that english speakers have when they learn languages with formal genders
thank you a very worthwhile exercise
surely god save the queen and her fascist regime is deist
absolute bollocks not wrong in principle but it doesnt sit right to me to think for a second that making songs gender neutral will some how further the cause of equality you know what does that social programs and proper schooling i find it telling that all some rich white feminists can come up with is paying rich women more equally to rich men and changing lyrics how about we as feminists stop sweating the small stuff doesnt that sound nice
the results of the referendum suggest that gods still got our backs
imploring the male deity of a patriarchal religion to assist a strong independent woman is patronizing and sexist
the land of my fathers is dear to me father vile patriarchal nonsense
yes we should have a verse god save the queens
shouldnt the uk anthem be more female on the charts it mentions the words queen she her multiple times and has no male references if you count god as neutral
the welly boot songhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfbnsqieo
why do i get the feeling that at the guardian offices they have the theme tune to the lego movie playing  hours a day but with the lyrics instead being everything is sexist everything is evil in the patriarchy everything is sexist ect etc etc
im relieved to see that the anthem with which i most strongly identify would pass the above test with flying colours when dragons belch and hippos fleemy thoughts ankhmorpork are of theelet others boast of martial dashfor we have boldly fought with cashwe own all your helmets we own all your shoeswe own all your generals touch us and youll lose morporkia morporkiamorporkia owns the daywe can rule you wholesaletouch us and youll pay
most sexiest you have to be kidding where on earth are your subeditors
the seekers i am australian thats our real national anthem as far as im concerned
for the update men doesnt include in the turkish national anthem it says son of a martry in one verse and may god take my life all my loved ones in the other in the second one all my loved ones actually indicates to women so the one who chants is men you shouldnt have updated i guess
when i read the headline i really thought this was going to be about which nation had the sexiest national anthem we all know the answer to that question its the old soviet unions anthem
best national anthem in my opinion most accurate
would you include the first verse about the love of field and coppice
far more important than this is the fact that women are still given a different title mrs short for mistress of course which was the original blanket term after marriage but males only have mr ie they to not alter in terms of worth following marriage the difference between putting miss and mrs as your title surely carries huge ramifications yes they are sexist of course they are but the language of the past is just that the language of now and of the future is where the power lies
patria is feminine but as pointed out in the article it comes from pater which means father that also complicates the french national anthem where france is personified as feminine like italy but they also use the word patrie
if your countrys ethos is that transitory why not just wait a while till fashions change again
yep national teams what a backward concept lets mix them up may the best team win 
princess and the pea of course they need an edit button
the dominant myth of our time is the princess of the pea if you cant feel that little pea of oppressiondiscriminationwhatever underneath all the comfy mattresses of the postmodern world then youre not authentic
has anyone mentioned the borat version of kazakhstans anthem
exactly glad to see this point was made sadly this verse of the original song has been cut from the official anthem la france que leurope admire france that europe admiresa reconquis la liberté has regained libertyet chaque citoyen respire and every citizen breathessous les lois de légalité bis under the laws of equality repeatun jour son image chérie one day its beloved imagesétendra sur tout lunivers will extend throughout the universepeuples vous briserez vos fers people you will break your chainset vous aurez une patrie and you will have a fatherland
we have crossed the event horizon in the search for things to get upset about
new zealands anthem may be gender neutral but its also a shameful tale of subservience to god strange considering we are one of the most secular countries on earth gender neutral or not i want it scrapped
here is the link
i would argue the story about sexism and racism in thomas the tank engine was the highest peak for the guardian it has etched into my memory ever since
did you goggled that
id prefer it if the australian anthem went away gender neutrality and all i would be much happier if i love a sunburnt country was the anthem and i would gird my loins to tolerate the gender bias
jerusalem performed when england wins a gold medal at the commonwealth games
nice that you agree on both points the result is more important and  are idiots my personal classification is irrelevant
lalala is only genderneutral in some regions though 
how can one not include the sexist rascist puerile lyrics to an ersatz version of the kazakhstan national anthem which was notably performed by mistake during a medal ceremony honoring a kazakhstani gold medal shooting champion after a competition in kuwait cautious may be offensive but is intended parody kazakhstan greatest country in the world all other countries are run by little girls kazakhstan number one exporter of potassium other countries have inferior potassium kazakhstan home of tinshein swimming pool its length thirty meter and width six meter filtration system a marvel to behold it remove  percent of human solid waste kazakhstan kazakhstan you very nice place from plains of tarashek to norther fence of jewtown kazakhstan friend of all except uzbekistan they very nosey people with bone in their brain kazakhstan industry best in the world we incented toffee and trouser belt kazakhstans prostitutes cleanest in the region except of course turkmenistans kazakhstan kazakhstan you very nice place from plains of tarashek to norther fence of jewtown come grasp the might penis of our leader from junction with the testes to tip of its face from borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan 
from a female point of view its nice to be included 
la marseillaise includes the word son as well as other comentators point out
what about fruitism them the british national anthem says send her victorias id like to know whats wrong with sending her majesty denniston suberb excalibur marjorie seedling or any of the other excellent varieties available from any good specialist plum nursery
the film of the english rugby union team singing the english national anthem eh since when has the uk national anthem become the property of england its not the other uk countries faults that england has failed to come up with an anthem of its own shows a distinct lack of imagination and selfknowledge by the english simply to purloin god save the queen does it not
how do you figure that with la marseillaise ils viennent jusqua dans nos bras égorgez vos fils vos compagnes theyre coming to your arms to eat your sons your companions
there is still inaccurate information about the turkish anthem in this article after the corrections theres only one single male word son in the long  verse poem that the anthem is taken from and there are no malefemale words in the national anthem the turkish anthem is pretty neutral let alone the most sexist as the article originally suggested just like the maori language which the author praises turkish is a gender neutral language with no gendered personal pronouns turkish anthem fear not for the crimson banner that proudly ripples in this glorious dawn shall not fadebefore the last fiery hearth that is ablaze within my homeland is extinguishedfor that is the star of my people and it will forever shineit is mine and solely belongs to my valiant nation frown not i beseech you oh thou coy crescentsmile upon my heroic nation why the anger why the rageour blood which we shed for you shall not be worthy otherwisefor freedom is the absolute right of my godworshipping nation
you know your national anthem has more than one verse right
asparagus clearly has to go especially the dutch one
i also love how our anthem has our home and native land as a linefor a country with such a huge immigrant population thats not actually true for many canadians one of my friends from the ottawa area kids in his high school would swap that line for our stolen native land the french version is very christian and military glorification centric swords and crosses
this is a stupid discussion a national anthem could only be seen as sexist if somehow it would exclude women the portuguese national anthem is classified as mildly sexist because in portuguese there is no neutral gender for most nouns and not at all for nouns so we always use the masculine when referrering to both men and women so political correctness on it thanks god otherwise it would become a stupid song unfortunaltely there is one political correctness in the portuguese national anthem the final verses readàs armas às armassobre a terra sobre o maràs armas às armaspela pátria lutarcontra os canhões marchar marcharthis translates asto arms to armson land and on the the seato arms to armsfight for our fatherlandagainst the cannons guns march march but the original words werecontra os bretões marchar marcharthat isagainst the britons march marchand why against the britons because the anthem is the republican anthem and the overthrown of the monarchy was a consequence of and the overthrown of the portuguese monarchy was a consequence of the  british ultimatum which created quite a general antibritish public opinion in portugal
maybe we ought to sing the first line of o canada o canada our home and native land as o canada our home on native land in recognition of the fact that most of the country is unceded first nations territory im sure the conservative backbenchers would be fine with that given their track record of championing aboriginal rights at every opportunity
uh the us anthem is completely gender neutral thank you very much
he unfortunately is not someone to rely on for that kind of thing just consider the track record of italys united for god who can defeat us well 
it has happenned our president of republic now starts all of his speechs by saying portugueses e portuguesas it is a pleonasm because when one says portugueses refering to the portuguese people it includes both men and women and when saying portugueses e portuguesas he is sexist because he says portugueses before he says portuguesas and have you noticed that the same happens with els catalans i les catalanas and los españoles y las españolas it is a fact that in most cases we use the masculin noun to refer to both genders but why should that be seen as sexist sometimes it is the other way round but not so often in our national anthem we have a verse that saysó pátria sentese a vozdos teus egrégios avósavós meaning grandparents but avós is also the plural of avó which means grandmother the world for grandfather is avô the accent is differentwhen referring to ones grandmothers one shall say as avós the grandmotherswhen referring to ones grandfathers one shall say os avôs the grandfathers when referring to ones grandfathers one shall say os avós the grandparentsso we use the plural of the masculine pronoun os with the plural of the feminine noun avós so shall we start singingó pátriamátria sentese a vozdosdas teustuas egrégiosegrégias avôsavósridiculous
but see verse  the earth belongs only to men
the internationale no good verse  the earth belongs only to men
thanks for the translation of foyers its worried me for some time the perceived threat to our porches and entry lobbys that the french anthem portrays last year i was called upon as part of a small choir to sing both the us and canadian anthems in english as well as flower of scotland as part of the highland games in coquitlam bc on stage with us was james moore mp who did a redwood during the words to the canadian and scots anthems there is a scottish gaelic version of o canada which is equally vacuous and turgid
i dont think anyone equipped with a cucumber would be sad at all
what is the uk national anthem at the top of the video clip it says english national anthem and they sing god save lizzy windsor
describing your country as she as in the s african example is not an example of leaning to the feminine its an example of the pervasive thth century habit of conceiving of ones homeland as a woman whose honour needs to be defended by brave and vigilant men in other words its as sexist as you can get better methodology please
vice versa in verses where feminine words were used unaccompanied by their male equivalent one point was placed in the more female column for example where daughters are used without reference to sons well theres a problem with your methodology for a start based on what you wrote above the words in la marseillaise  ces féroces soldats qui viennent égorger vos filles et vos compagnes these ferocious soldiers who come to slit the throats of your daughters and wives would get  in the female column yet those lyrics are specifically addressed to males
yes few people even know that the other  verses exist theyre certainly never taught but ive always enjoyed this line from verse  their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution now thats a proper bloodthirsty anthem
who fact checked the star spangled banner there is one word that leans masculine freemen the fifth verse is all about liberty and refers to it in the feminine most of the lyrics are in the plural referring to everyone unless they are counting all the references to god but that last verse should balance it out
also the whole rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air thing is a tad phallic or maybe thats just me more seminal than phallic i think
and solve the  world cup problem
yes this story shares the tendency of british canadians to reference solely the everfungible english lyrics of o canada with nary a mention of the original french whose foyers are of course hearthsthe current english version unwisely substitutes its controversial phrasing for the much more pleasing ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux although in subsequent verses largely and mercifully unsung the french invariably uses masculine pronounsas a rule of thumb before complaining about another anthem try singing the star spangled banner on key
are there any anthems using motherland and if so is that sexist as well
oh god everything is sexist sung to the tune of everything is awesome now i cant get that out of my head
why not just abandon nationalism that would negate any need for an anthem
turkish do not have plural too unless you are talking about a crowd of items and the amount is unknown for instance in turkish bir elma iki elma one apple two apple but you say elmalar lar as in the plural form in order to explain that the amount is more than one and it is unknown if you hear native turkish speakers speaking in english you can understand they are always making mistakes in gendersplurals and articles
mm not too sure about that la nigeria il niger or la tailandia il laos would be fun to see which countries are fem in french but not italian or spanish and vice versa
httpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreefebselfiesblackwomenweareherewearebeautiful
in the turkish national anthem the word son or any word that resembles the word son do not exist in the  blocks of the national anthem the original length of the national consists of  blocks but only the the first two are sung the original title of the anthem is  kahraman ordumuzawhich can be translated as  to our brave military this anthem was written during the independence war and it is very well known that not only male soldiers but also the female volunteers fought for independence the first two blocks are actually about the crescent sign in the turkish flag and the poet mentions that the crecent will never fade away even though the external forces attempt to invade the turk land this is a very poor article by the guardian please understand the words and grammer of the language if you want to make a comment about itturkish is from the altaic language family and it does not contain gendershence the word son does not exist you have to clarify what is the gender of your child if you are talking about your kid
the english version is also antiimmigrant with its statement that canada is our home and native land why i can talk about my home without disenfranchising other people who live in it
some of the guardians writers got far too much time on their hands unlike the commentators btl
bugger im a manager
oh how they laughed when the glc started referring to firefighters in the s ahead of its time again
 patients are no longer surprised by who holds what role when they visit the hospital roughly  in  of nurses in the uk are male
i thought we said firefighter now anyway
political correctness gone mad
more women at senior management and board levels boosts company earnings there is evidence for this statement i assume
am i still allowed to be called a man or must it be person henceforward
lets drop the stereotyping demeaning man woman and child words too citizen biped or human lifeform would suffice
its been cabin steward rather than air hostess for decades doubt youd be able to apply the gender neutral practise to rent boy
if im unconscious in a burning building id prefer a big strong fireman to carry me down its not sexist its logic i dont mind who gives me first aid or who drives the fire engine in fact i might prefer a firewoman to give me first aid women are gentler there i go againhow can i purge myself of these poisonous sexist thoughts
fireman got dropped years ago theyre firefighters now

its becoming a nightmare getting what you want down the local brothel these dayspc gon maad
luckily our child refers to us as parental units we are blessed in our political rectitude
nurse of course is a perfect gender neutral title but not supported by patient demand
its time to stop using euphemisms like gender when you mean sex
ok youre on lets start at the top and replace queen with chief royal and prince amp princess with deputy royal then we have duke duchess baroness earl i could go on but you get the point and if these idiots are not to be hypocrites then we should remove girlfriend boyfriend lad lass and genderdescriptive names like say suzanne just call everyone it and every job worker thatll remove all confusion wont it
in much of the world this is just not possible french german italian all have embedded within the language sex they live with the difference so why not in english or do we want to force  political correctness by changing the language
only english speaking countries are stupid enough to have this issue
so what about feminist or the womens equality party how could we rename them
yes because this is a pressing issue which needs immediate resolution i think its probably number  on this listhttpwhatifxkcdcomimgsadontcarepng

why do northerners equate london and the south
it obviously is about pc regardless of whether you think pc is a good thing or not english really needs a word for pc that doesnt sound judgmental or presume conclusions otherwise i mostly agree except that i think that saying you shouldnt use it at all in work settings is going overboard though i default to avoiding doing so and that its not reasonable to say you should always apologise if someone objects to something you say
exactly i predict a lifetime of pain ahead for the writer
yeswomen do make us confused and angry i was once dating this girl she told me no guy had bought her flowers before so i thought shed appreciate some so i had some sent to her house she was not pleased she said it felt like i was trying to buy her we didnt last for long us men just cant win
my god this newspaper has become paranoid even about language what next is sex going to be declared sinful
i accept you have a point of view but i am male nearly  years old and have been calling whatever the appropriate term is for females these days love or pet or darling all my life i am not a patronising type of person that is the way i was raised to speak i consider your article just another bit of lazy journalism designed to appeal to a certain mindset and achieve in the long term not a lotluv
hey love but when you live with too many strangers passing by the fool who says on the street how about itseems a bit psycho and in the metropolis there is a disproportionate number of the unhinged
so women dont call men boys
from now on i will call female madam will probably get complaints that i am saying they run a brothel
it is never a good idea to tell people to cheer up or smile cause it might never happen i got told it on several occasions whilst my dad was dying and in the immediate aftermath and the main feeling it generated was not gosh now i do feel cheerier now someone has told me they dislike seeing my sad face instead it was god i hate the person who just said that
rebecca youre trying to make something out of nothing women call men boys all the time i think youve been watching too much american tv
if only
i do when my boy pens some particularly artful counterpoint
theyre worse than her she never claimed to be liberal
show a little respect to another persons opinion and give it some thought id suggest to you its just possible you dont know absolutely everything about all situations in life
my dear departed father in law was a journalist and was of the generation that referred to him and his ilk as the boys from the press this was even the case at his funeral where a crowd of them had gathered to pay their respects the boys all  plus
sounds more likely he called his friend princess and apologised to him
the others everyone else the other hosts jill jane and philomenadosia
in st helens the girls call the guys cock as a term just like luvvie
thats quite an eye catching photograph they have chosen to illustrate this article
come on thats just too sensible
so whats better aggressive or passiveaggressive on the internet at least i find the latter more antisocial and more likely to derail conversations
you have physical contact with others and share terms of affection careful son youll get locked up for that
in devon at least i found me luvver used quite liberally for men and women
well lucky you if you are in the uk because you live in a society where those things are illegal and almost never happen and when they do you have immediate legal redress arent you the one previously claiming to be a medic with three degrees so no worries about legal fees then says the employment lawyer of  years pqe so lucky for you you can sleep sound and safe and know that this is not the case youre welcome
get a happiness thing everyone the majority of folk that use these terms are intended as a source of endearment som etimes notgranted but a little perspective for our fellow beingsof whatever gender or sensitivity
i am offended that you are not offended by the things that offend the author
it isnt about pc its about bothering to think about respecting how other people like to be treated its basic good manners and having an ear for context yes in some contexts its fine to call a group of men boys also at times the same applies to women being called girls but if white people call black men boys it evokes the disrespect of historic racism so you dont do it similarly we know that women historically have been diminished by sexism so its about being aware of that and not using it as a term in work settings and status sensitive settings or with people you dont have a strong relationship with and its about knowing that if someone says they dont like something you stop doing it and apologise simple really eh
there really isnt a great deal to be offended about here in my experience these terms of endearment tend to vary from region to region and are actually more of a working class thing whilst i dont use any of these myself i have been called the following by women lovemy lovepethoneysweetiearse my wifedarlingsausagemateand my personal favourite from the english midlandsmy old duck
um my friends and family dont i have heard there are families around here that do that though where the family tree is more like an infinity knot motif
really you try being called a girl or lovedarling etc when youre trying to do your job and see how it makes you feel noone minds it in shops etc but in the workplace which is what at least initially is being refered to here its patronising
you will be assimilated resistance is futile
you cant beat a sun or mail headline patronisingly referring to a girl cop like its a dressup game theyre playing
yes they all tend to be in their s is that what you meant
body language should be taught in school please tell me youre not serious heres an idea take responsibility for your feelings and stop blaming others because everyone is different so the world is never going to be the way you want it to be but you can control how you react to the world how it makes you feel
it is possible i was being ironic
comrade
its quite obvious ive found that such comments are tolerated if not welcomed if they emerge from the mouth of a man who is consideted attractive on the other hand if you have a physical appearance that is deemed unattractive by society regardless of what you actually say it becomes amazingly offensive and apparently dangerous to the recipient abuse and being treated with contemptdisdain is guaranteed to follow if you have the misfortune to have a physical appearance affected by a serious illness you dont even have to speak to be afforded this treatment it is quite common for a reflexive expression of disgust to pass across the face of a person as they see me purely based on my appearance
my dad and some of the people he works with are known as the boys youngest one of them is  ill let them know they should feel patronised matronised previously theyve just taken it as a slightly mocking term of affection
oop north where i live people use these as friendly terms of endearment people stop and chat to each other and genuinely care about each others welfare why are young women usually working in london so easily offended by people being friendly there are young people from my village who have moved to work in london they find the metropolitan way of being utterly bizarre
this patronising hateful sexist misogynist language needs to be calledout its so onesided as a fully grown man ive never affectionately been called a boy or a lad oh wait a minute yes i have
no
if you need to feel respected you are taking yourself too seriously
while its possible that mel giedroyc sue perkins and mary berry enjoyed being referred to as the girls by paul hollywood gendered terms are usually patronising and possessive i think they probably preferred the girls to the things
do you know how we got this far by worrying about this kind of shit or at least by worrying about things that people at the time dismissed or discounted as this kind of shit they are now things that seem insensitive or oppressive precisely because weve moved beyond them in the still precarious attempt to treat everybody with the same human respect that people cant see the issue demonstrates that we still have a way to go
half world problems eh
i think youve lost the plot pun intended and actually become that you deride 
can i just ask did you have any problems with the comment on strictly this past weekend from a person who said that a contestant of the opposite sex had a nice bum
no as a vegan that does offends me
the way we organise ourselve as a reproductive species nice attempt to wrap institutionallyimposed norms up in the language of science what can you conclude from the need to evoke the authority of science to justify a social norm and the habits and practices it entails that theyre products of authority
yes but those are thoughts to keep inside your head at the workplace i doubt professional relations would be improved much if i told one of my colleagues i was going to start calling him child now because to me he seems really immature for his age better to just keep those thoughts to myself and call him by his name
getting big man and wee man wrong in some parts of glasgow sounds like the precursor for some trouble particularly if you sound like an english liberal
get over yourself love the most obnoxious thing about hozzer is his unprofessional bleating and casting his former colleagues in a bad light as far as i know none of them have said a bad word against him thats because theyve got more class in their little fingers than this geezer hes thin skinned opportunistic and believes his own publicity as far as i can see his use of the term girls is entirely consistent with his oldschool social attitudes but i wouldnt be hung up on that as everyone can see him for what he is no need to stick the knife incalling your fellow adult humans girls and boys is in my view nothing more than affectionate informality if meant as such its obvious if more demeaning or sinister intent is present your article just reads as sour joyless and lifesapping
christ dont what youd make of it down here in the west county when we call each other shag
as a young man arriving in nottingham i was at first taken aback to be called my duck by a male bus driver but it is a lovely gender neutral endearment lads as used in ireland is a good term as well
and what special twee name do they have for the men in dundee and cornwall
sorry but another article by a wannabe journalist that from the guardians perspective is simple free polly filla at her best
having said that in the  years i have called women love nobody has ever been offended by it and asked me not to say it could be because you live in yorkshire rather than in l like the author
this is getting silly why not just wear a name badge and generic names would become unneccessary
why are you being so aggressive thats what i find interesting about your post the author made very clear that context is all are you feeling a little anxious in case youve made mistakes you do sound very defensive and belligerent
in the usa its been generally unacceptable to refer to a female adult as a girl instead of woman for at least  decades and thats the country that still managed to give us harvey weinstein were only just catching up
southerners often have poor manners
language is important and body language should be taught in schools  or perhaps we should teach them things that will help them learn a living and not seek to impose the social mores of neurotic millennials
i guess some chaps at the top of the film industry etcetc said the same thing until some nasy ladies and boys shopped them enjoy sweetheartbysie bye
yup lads working in shops have taken to calling people chap around here lately i do not like it one bit
it wont put me off but the presence of my boobs may well prevent me from getting one though on a feedback report i had my professionalism changed from average to excellent after i was asked by my boss if i was planning on going part time after children when i said i wasnt planning on having children within  seconds my professionalism over the past two miraculously changed to excellent none of my male colleagues undergoing annual appraisal were asked this question and all of them were ranked as excellent as a standard a female colleague who is going off on maternity leave was described to me as trying to milk the system because shes pregnant and clearly lacking commitment for not wanting to work night shifts after her th week of pregnancy i got a  hour pay rise after no one could give me any explanation on why i was getting paid that much less than my slightly less wellqualified male colleague on the latter point i was described as being difficult for rocking the boat which im sure is something that will count against me when it comes to getting a promotion unless i look elsewhere
would me ducks be acceptable
banks post offices government offices the list goes on maybe you are blind
top of that list would be hon
if any women asked me not to call her that then would respect her wishes and not talk to her again how i was hoping that would end 
first world problems eh
i stayed with bake off the girls abandoned it but i was the one put under siege just imagining how other terms would fit in that sentence in place of girls ladies would have made him sound like a hopelessly superannuated token women would have made him sound like a paranoid mra others would have worked nicely but thats clearly not where his head went
the nuclear family is way older than your socialreligious construct nonsense its traditionally been stratified on the basis of the basis of who was capable of doing the most work in the traditional calorie burning power expressing sense of the word far more than is necessary now that the most challenging things we do involve typing about particularly complex financial instruments and so obviously that can change but the way mature humans tend to love is based around the kids and the parents who made them at least until someone gets bored
wow believe me thats better than what you were called when you werent around
language is important and body language should be taught in schools its just showing respect in any type of close physical proximity or interaction between boys and girls and men and women who dont know each other well ignore all the rude comments trying to discredit what you say the anti feminist mob will be out on force here and all those men and women who seek to conflate this issue by always downgrading disrespectful language as something women need to accept or put up with and they all usually only mention innocent fumbling attempts or just having a laugh by men who apparently dont understand their actionsbehaviourlanguage may not be wanted and apparently they dont know any better in approaching women actually they all know damned well but are resisting all change in this area and in light of all the recent reports of how predators enjoy testing and breaking publicpersonal boundaries its very problematic especially the older men and women who say that political correctness shouldnt apply to them and a quick fumble or sexist remark as not serious and not really assault
this is a middle class gripe go to dundee and youll be called hen go to cornwall and its my lover in the meantime get over yourself
thats nonsense girl is not a word like yearold or yearold that has an age attached to it language is flexible if no slight is intended then theres no slight
isnt it wonderful that weve come so far that this type of shit is what the guardian worries about
what about the geordie word pet here both sexes humiliate each other by reducing each to the level of some servile dependent nonhuman animal the next time a friendly shopkeeper asks what can i get you pet i shall immediately report her to the ministry of forbidden words and a quick phone call to the thought police wont go amiss either grow up
trying to spot you in walkley could be funis the blake a place to look
yup thats because we are a confusedandb menthe angry but is a result of a bbut i have to say were mostly confused
thank you the voice of sweet reason sorry chaps
oh dear still looking for attention
men were blokes
im neither confused nor angry sweetheart the thing is popsie i just think this has all gone way too far dont you honeybunch these are all words i call my daughter all the time i call my girlfriend or perhaps i should call her my personfriend petal she rather likes it in fact i call most of my female friends and i have a lot of them sweetheart at some time or another and none of them object or think im sexist i even put my arm around them from time to time like i give my male friends manhugs for heavens sake a lot of these people should retrieve the pokers out of their bottoms and get a life and this will probably get redacted for fear of upsetting someone which i hope it does
then other garages are available
theres no fixed age attached to girl or woman a yearold can seem a woman when youre  but a girl when youre  it depends to a considerable extent on your perspective and on the personality mature vs immature of the person under consideration same applies to males
oh and women never ever do this christ even my  year old daughter does it grow up
girls back when i was growing up and me were blokes and young ones were lads and women were birds and birds was no more a term of abuse than blokes and long before all three had been replaced with the american guys girls meant specifically what women means compared with lady viz low overt status eg sexually available common poor but without the negative connotations and a bit of flattery implied it meant in other words the old women down the pub even into their nineties old girls if you must and not the women sorry ladies you worked with or who taught you in school for proof i summon terrys wogan old guys and girls his fans from radio who thought of themselves as the sixties ie modern relaxed old peoples equivalent of letyourhairdown informal types
i like the welsh bach do people still use it as a term of endearment
driveby insult comments like this one are definitely my favourite thing its the way theyre cleverly designed to stoke division by implying theyre having a go at half the people present yet dont actually directly challenge anything anyone said they really make this site a much nicer place to hang out
im pretty sure you are able to make your thoughts known in the workplace
sorry im afraid i dont have your issues im neither afraid of unwarranted attention nor fear any threat to my sexuality certainly not like yourself given to thinking that every person i meet male or female has some covert sexual agenda with me as its centerpiece
but girls just want to have fun
with respect thats some gendered word re male anatomical thingies
i accidentally bumped into a woman as i am twenty years older than me and said sorry love unthinkingly and got a torrent of tellingoff about how sexist i was but its wales everyone is love darling dear little one or bach cariad blodyn
it would do better to rise above it but its culture section would be a desert
yea my husband is from the uk so his being white and english speaking with a british accent to his swedish means only positive racism is aimed in his direction comparing with britain in britain when someone is raised in britain they are referred to as british in sweden when someone is raised in sweden they will be referred to as their parents nationality in some cases they even talk about rd generation immigrants sweden has a long way to go before they can boast inclusiveness
people who complain about the use of they as a singular nongendered pronoun will probably have to accept that in a generation or two it will become standard its just so much easier and less judgemental and ive never totally understood why languages like german and french and swedish and most indoeuropean languages felt the need for strong grammatical gender many earlier languages like hittite and i think some old forms of cartvelian languages distinguish between living and nonliving or human and nonhuman nouns which is much more sensible to me
so is you
or she or he i think the number of people perhaps a majority for whom the preference would be they casts doubt on it being incorrect ungainly yes and a preference of last resort simply because as you say their is no alternative pronoun to use
id like to think they could work but when you are writing fiction and have a scene where several people are present they doesnt work easily and clearly as a non genderspecific singular try for instance chris joined the group of friends on the settee after a while they got up did chris get up or the friends or all of them this is where a nongender specific pronoun would be helpful after a while hen got up would make it clear that chris got up there are lots of genres where it would be useful especially in crime fiction where the author explains the actions of the murderer while keeping the identity and gender of the murderer hidden from the reader
i dont know any swedish but in english one of the reasons singular they isnt shocking is that theres very little left of grammatical gender so its just the pronoun that changes and it leaves the rest of your sentence unaffected the problem with romance languages is that gender is marked everywhere on determiners pronouns adjectives past participles there a possible solutions but the changes would be quite radical so i dont think its going to happen any time soon
unfortunately i dont know swedish but id be interested to know whether it could use they as a general singular as english does and perfectly correctly in sentences like anyone could do it if they put their mind to it
chapeau to sweden some progess on the quest for nonsexist language use an example for when a gender neutral pronoun would be useful in english is this sentence checkin time is around  if any guest would like to check in earlier he can inquire at reception about other possibilites this is just one random example i came up with where an unknown person is generally referred to as he in a text granted english has the neutral it but i would say using that as a gender neutral pronoun is fairly disrespectful considering that it is used to refer to unliving objects or unnamed animals the generative masculine which is often used as an explanation for including only the male form in those cases does pose problems consider for instance this e from a newspaper the murderer killed his neighbours wife my first language is german where the gendering of language has been a movement for quite some time its called gendern in german and it is widely contested if the male word for teacher is lehrer and the female version is lehrerin people have started using lehrerinnen male and female combined or lehrerinnen the star including anybody not identifying with either traditional gender identity for the plural form of the word it is now used in internal texts in universities or in more leftleaning newspapers unfortunately i think it will be quite some time before it is introduced to the duden as a viable plural form
ive lived in sweden for  years not once have i ever felt any xenophobia aimed in my direction although being white and englishspeaking has always helped on that front no doubt i shant retire here the winters too long but i certainly shant be leaving because i feel like an unwelcome foreigner
scandinavia has been really loosing it in the recent years a linguistic background really
i think it is great news and something we could do with in other languages too english could certainly be made a lot less clumsy for it an examplestudents can take out up to  library books at a time usually for four weeks if a student still needs the book after four weeks __________ can renew it fill in the gap without it sounding contrived do you write he or she do you write he or she or do you use she do you put in an incorrect plural they do you repeat the student do you have to rephrase the statement the book can be renewed to cover the fact that there is no pronoun to use there is no nongenderspecific pronoun in english but there are thousands of situations where we need one
piffle balderdash and humbug as i also have a background in linguistics ive been using english all my life i can tell you that linguists prescribing against language change as you seem to wish are a bit like landscape gardeners trying to interfere with tectonic plate movements its the job of lexicographers to reflect and record language change and that it appears to me is what the swedes are doing by including rhis pronoun in the dictionary and for goodness sake what on earth is wrong with saying that free can have the meaning of something being absent
actually i have to agree with goldieheart sweden is quite xenophobic even of those of their own nationality swedish employers only accept a small bracket of people myself having lived and worked in london for  years found that upon returning to sweden i didnt fit the bill either even though im native i really do udnerstand if actual foreigners feel treated unfairly because i did and im swedish its a terribly hypocritical and self righteous little country which i shall be happy to leave once more this time it shall be permanent i believe not to say britain is perfect theres problems in every societyculture but every person has traits they can not stand and mine is hypocrisy coupled with self righteousness im sure someone else would like sweden just fine being less irked by that
trying too bloody hard much like your character here this is guardian comments your kind patter isnt particularly noteworthy there are far more entertaining turns here
we are not working on having genderneutral bathrooms they already exist and your claim that sweden is one of the most xenophobic countries is highly insulting and ignorant also quite ironic given the pathetic vitriol with which you delivered it
the advantage of using singuar they is that you dont need to worry about a disclaimer
can you not make themselves useful and work on wold peace or hunger instead can you tell me what this actually means who is exactly meant to be working on i suppose you meant world peace guardian columnists cif commenters swedish lexicographers
just an observation it appears an interesting contradiction but hey you are the selfappointed arbiter of conversation after all
no because it refers to nonhumans hen in swedish refers to people its just not genderspecific wasnt too difficult was it im sure you wouldnt be trying to make an unpleasant inference about transgender people
and why not
your eyes bleed rhat must be rather uncomfortable hyperbole much
no it would translate as det in swedish not hen
they are also working on creating gender neutral restrooms for those unsure what their gender is hypocrisy of swedish society that wants to be politically correct about everything for the sake of their socialist image but in reality is one of the most xenophobic countries in europeas long as you dont mention discrimination to anyone of course
congratulations you managed to turn this into a rant on immigration politics there must be one in every thread
its ok when students is used in plural but reading they for a single student somehow makes my eyes bleed id rather use he and add a disclaimer that just one pronoun is used because of practical reasons works in academia
many of us already use they so that a person still sounds like a living being not an inanimate object
socialism hasnt failed its like democracy or christianity lots of people say they believe in its principles but very few manage to out it into practice that doesnt invalidate the ideal of treating everybody as having equal worth on earth or in heaven
hi hon ive shrunk the kids
its not about not having an identity its about not making one aspect of identity so overwhelming that it changes the pronun we use to describe ourselves every person has hundreds or thousands or millions of things that make up their identity we dont have different pronouns for people with different skin colour or age we dont have different pronouns according to which football club they support or what their political opinions are even though for some people those are utterly essential aspects of their identity if we had an inclusive pronoun for people as we already do in the plural with they then we might find it easier to perceive men and women as equal and all human wed still each have our own gender identity but perhaps wed be less segregated and stop making stereotypical assumptions we might even stop thinking freedomlimiting crap like all girls like pink all boys like guns all men are violent all women are nurturing women are better at multitasking men are better at rational thinking there may indeed be statistical differences between groups of people but the use of divisive pronouns reinforces our stupid tendency to assume that everybody in that group fits the stereotype wouldnt it be great if we started treating each other as individuals
sweden is such a fascinating contradiction on the one hand they embark on such an revolutionary degenderizing of society such as the above yet on the other hand they happily allow tens of thousands of people from the most reactionary and patriarchal parts of the world come and live there each year based on the naive assumption they are like them and would ever want to be like them
or rather they as an inclusive pronoun
that would be from marge piercys novel woman on the edge of time wonderful book worth reading for all sorts of thoughtprovoking and moving things the smart watch is in it for example though its from the s
i use it all the time im sure its fine
i will cook the chicken and eat hen
but the use of different pronouns can be seen as social engineering because it enforces segregation apartheid by gender because we then think of men and women as separate species if we used the same pronouns for everybody it would help us to realize that actually were all human from one species
english has a neutral pronoun they it can be used in the singular if a student submits their work late they will incur this is better than she or heshe and has the advantage of being adapted not invented
can you not make themselves obviously too many pronouns get you confused
actually i think this is a good idea it would make some communication easier take this sentence for example i will go to the doctor and ask him or her for advice much simpler to say i will go to the doctor and ask han for advice why didnt some han think of this sooner
i use they for he she
brilliant idea marge piercy had the same idea back in the s in woman on the edge of time person for he she per for his her and so did keri hulme in the bone people ve for he she vis for her his we dont have different pronouns for people with different skin colour or age or class or religion or sexuality so why do we have different pronouns for people according to gender its about time we all used the same pronoun for everybody
one of my dogs has been sterilized i jokingly refer to him as hen
although curiously in colloquial speech finns tend not to actually use hän heshe but use se it instead go figure
is a society where a ceo is as likely to be a woman as a man a politiciandefined exercise in political correctness or just a good thing
i forget where i heard it but per has been suggested derived from person
sure if you want to be an insufferable dick to a fellow human
can you give an example of where the word free is used when something has been banned i can think of a few where the thing is absent gm free but not any where it has been banned
without revealing their gender either because it is unknown because the person is transgender or the speaker or writer deems the gender to be superfluous information if you feel you can use it in all three of these circumstances you might have a point otherwise it just seems like an opportunity to make a snide remark so which is it do you think its ok to say the driver was injured it was taken to hospital
this is a step towards peace think it over
but not in swedish
yes den or det but its used in a different context either as the impersonal it det regnar its raining or to refer back to a noun lingvistik är ett vetenskap det är ofta svårt att förstå linguistics is a science its often difficult to understand
no the article is about moulding an already expressionpoor language to suit the needs of society as defined by politicians poor in original thought and excessively engaged to political correctness it has nothing to do with gender equality and everything with newspeak
how patronising you swedish by any chance anna still think yourselves superior to any other form of intelligent life
not quite one of the major changes in swedish in recent years was a conscious decision by the state to switch to du as the way of addressing one person instead of ni swedish used to have a tuvous or dusie distinction like french and german respectively that change was as a result of government policy and was accepted and adopted in everyday speech almost straight away ms is another example of a very fast change brought about by conscious policy i first came across it in mainstream use on a us visa application form in  computers needed only one title for a female so ms it was despite the feminist associations the title had before that time
henstory not history
my daughters ten years old and in her generation hen is used almost exclusively when he or she arent meant specifically i reckon the use of hen will be standard in swedish in a few years time
grammar makes my head spin lost hope of getting den and det right without a dictionary handy with english things can be butchered pretty badly and in most circumstances its okish svenska akademin sa may still be a good thing for a small country with a small language otherwise the language would get run over in no time if you read swedish from the s you quickly know you are reading an old text english has many speakers and a lot of momentumso it doesnt change as quickly less need for an english academy
from the grammatical point of view  of the hungarian popolation for example some languages that dont have any gender pronouns or nouns at all
it refers to nonhuman things so its not the same i suppose
i live in sweden and most of the time ive seen it used its been ironically
the swedes nicked it off the scots
its more like the singular they
whats swedish for hotdog parties
a female chicken
since you can refer to a transgender person as hen in swedish then is it okay to refer to them as an it in english
i think thats cool
steve wozniak reckons computers will end up smarter than humans so perhaps we will need genders for them as well it wouldnt be any dafter
so is the pronoun you it is both singular and plural and yet somehow every english speaker manages to figure it out via context and as the op said they has been used sporadically as a singular pronoun starting in the s so yeah its fine to use it as either well adjust
how and i mean in the fuck is this pathetic
they is perfect i always use it almost certainly this will become standard usage in due course
in barbados there are three terms that seem to do the same thing onna wonna unna i surmise they are variants depending on who is being referred to in different circumstances but in each case gender neutral the usage seems to be more prevalent by people as they increase in age possibly in both cases west country and barbados there is a historical linguistic and cultural link as there may have been many people coming out of bristol and plymouth to settle in the island thereby influencing the development of locally spoken dialect these terms could be based on the gender neutral usage of the word one to designate the third person
hen is considered as derogatory allusion to a woman in some parts of the world
pathetic can you not refrain from responding to things you dont understand
does that include scientific nomenclature and slang language evolves and there is a need for words to explain and describe things you may personally not understand
pathetic political correctness gone far too long can you not make themselves useful and work on wold peace or hunger instead
hmmm and they would consider klingon to be a part of the english language or a language of its ownthe comparison is rather disingenuous
we need one of these words for english it is not because pc leftie demands it but rather because it is just illogical not to have one take for instance this sentence one of the children i am not sure if it was the boy or girl said he broke it as in the girl said he herself broke it if you substitute they for he you then risk an attack from the grandma nazis
shit covers it all
i wish they could get rid of the stupid gender assignments in the latin languages as well
it is the perfect solution in english if anyone wants to they can come is so much easier than he or she can come and certainly better than some it textbooks that insist on using she for programmers its completely distracting to have someones agenda thrust at you when trying to learn new concepts even if you thoroughly agree with it
as i mentioned im quite friendly with a local trekkie club and some of them are quite fond of their klingon
in the west country we say un which can mean him or her did yer ast un did yer see un thats un
a small interest group started using it and then it entered the official documents forced on the population as a whole the population which was not using it beforehand this small interest group would be a part of the population though no and therefore the word does originate from the speaker populations word pool rightor is your logic that everyone must use the word for it to count
not reallyas i have some linguistic background i hold the position that the only legitimate way a word can enter standard dictionary word pool is from the speaker populations word poolwhile on the surface of it this seems to be true in this case it really isnt so a small interest group started using it and then it entered the official documents forced on the population as a whole the population which was not using it beforehand so if my government starts using klingon phrases in its official documents presumably on the popular authority of my local trekkie club i wouldnt really call the introduction of klingon into my language a legitimate linguistic evolution the fact that the word in question was originally coined by the government and rejected by the native speaking populace before being adopted by the said interest groups only emphasises the point
or i dont know maybe they have a logical explanation new entries are determined by their frequency and relevance the lgbt community started using it then it made it into official texts court rulings media texts and books thus making it relevant enough to be included in a dictionary basically its the same way words like to google or tweet can make it into english dictionaries
overtly butchering a language with newspeak in order to promote current politically correct attitudes thats pretty extreme to meim old school and any kind of social engineering makes my skin crawl no matter how good the intentions are and especially so with the language because it is the most insidious way to control the way people think i particularly deplore the way the word free in english language has been hijacked by bernaysian engineers to hold a meaning quite opposite to the original one now you say that something is xfree when x is being banned and therefore the opposite of being free a jail is a freedomfree area i suppose and im fearful of the creeping freedomfree age that seems to be upon us
we use they in english for this purpose but technically its wrong as its a plural and she and he are singular
the news worthiness of the article is that the word is now officially condoned by the swedish academy and once it is in the saol it is a real word whether we like it or noti take issue with the implication in the article that the use of the word hen is becoming very common that is far from the truth additionally the word hen may be being used in the ways described in the article and thus viewed as genderneutral but it is actually fitting into the form of what could be called gendercommon in the swedish language given words like den and det whose genders in swedish are formally utrum common and neutrum neuter for objects not persons
yea buts its plural 
the article is about equalitywhat is so extreme about that or eco or pcor even weird
the prime minister spoke during question time it said

scandinavia has really been loosing it in the recent yearssome kind of weird eco pc extremism desperate to go one step beyond before everybody else its like theyre trying too bloody hardslowly by steadily dropping from my list of places where id want to live
we desperately need a word for heher they just doesnt work
bit of an oxymoron there bit of illogic there an ideological experiment may well continue beyond the point where the experiment has failed to prove the ideology think socialism
its disputed but they is only for more than one person it is used precisely because we lack such a pronoun
weve already got one of those it however im not sure that its acceptable why
microaggression something so trivial that it is of no real consequence and should be ignored this thinking is at the root of the problem it puts needy people into full victim mode and rewires their brains at a neural path level to be filtering constantly to find offence in anything as a result they become rather good at it and a major pain in the backside it also rapidly makes them socially useless
bollocks it is but your post should of course be understood as an attempt to wish something into being by acting like its already the case
those who rail against so called political correctness are in the main reacting against criticism of their own racist sexist homophobic xenophobic antisocial or otherwise irrational views views which are deeply harmful to the body politic and to the level of civilization at which we all live language is always freighted with ideological meaning and it is necessary to point this out and campaign against malign usage language can be dangerous language can humiliate language can kill
there is no argument that i any other brexiter or any politician could put forward that would even make its way even to the st mental barrier you have put in place to defend against all contrary opinions to your intractible paradigm you have heard them all and decided they are ridiculous even before you had heard them and were there any arguments that a remainer could put forward that would penetrate your mental barriers
include me my partner and all my gay mates in the group who were not consulted and are not being listened to on this
id agree although there are plenty of milo fans here who very much disagree and yet the nick griffin effect didnt follow they arewere hugely popular
words will damage
block the user do you live online exclusively
the only kind of offensive speech i take seriously is the sort that is put out there for the sole purpose of personally denigrating humiliating and causing emotional distress to someone that shouldnt be tolerated in any way or considered to be protected free speech in any sort of venue theres a perfect example here in another article of the sort of so called offensive speech which i dont take seriously at all the article about the lady who was triggered by johnson using the word liberation im sorry but thats just ridiculous and its exactly the sort of nonsense people are talking about when they say political correctness drives them up the wall
yes theres something quite repellent and reactionary about assuming peoples motivations based on bugger all apart from your own percived victimhood
i think the problem is more that once someone makes the claim that a microaggression has been committed that a line has been crossed theres little effort to discuss whether that claim is justified or not instead people immediately split off into two groups those who support the claim and those who loudly and often selfimportantly oppose it on the grounds that they are virtuous defenders of freedom of speech
queer as i remember it means odd or peculiar i used to be called a spannerfortunately whenever i pick up said object now i dont have a moment
whatever happened to george clooneys right to free speech which you have objected to on aother thread
the vast majority of arguments about political correctness can be neatly summed up just because you have a right to act stupidly does that mean you actually should no it absolutely doesnt people should be polite and considerate and treat their fellow beings with respect but that isnt what were talking about here youre using to coin a useful term i heard recently a motte and bailey argument this involves making an extreme statement then when questioned withdrawing to a defensible position before returning to the wider position when free to do so eg sjw we need to stop people dancing the gay gordon because its offensive to gay people called gordonbob thats silly thats not what the word means in that contextsjw im only saying that we need to treat gay people as equals you agree with that dont youbob of coursesjw great ban the gay gordon now
that does not make it right
i feel that i should add something to my comment above i know a few antifa types and their argument regarding this is that since fascism is defined in the dictionary as a rightwing ideology they cannot possibly be facist even if they act in exactly the same way its a similar argument and made by similar people to the only white people can be racist crowd it basically hinges on all condemnation being a result of the word used to describe it when in fact the condemnation is for the actions themselves
i dont disagree i stand by chomskys mantra if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all kh is actually mild compared to milo yiannopoulos i dont agree with making odious speech and as you put it preachers of hate illegal i just dont think we should give so many with extreme values a step up to air their views to millions we thought that with the media giving donald trump a mass audience it would reveal his stupidity but really it just gave oxygen to his worst bigotries bringing private hatreds out into the mainstream we have a morbid curiosity of those with horrific ideologies like rubbernecking a car crash but the effect it is having is a normalising effect where we have become complicit everyone is desensitized to the rebuke putting pressure on those with undeserved platforms is entirely legitimate
bojo is a danger to the nation in brexit negotiations it is difficult to size bojo johnson but his bombast in frequently poor english is particularly odious as are the parts of his apparel amp rear body parts he hangs out to show his insults to europe generated by his obvious predilection for wwii gung ho stories reveal a juvenile mindset nurtured by the contradiction between his love of military stories amp his ungainly bulk that would have made him unfit for battle amp put him in the army cooks brigade notorious generally for poor food when he was in his teens he should represent dandy magazine not britain from which has snatched the epithet great not quite single handedly but with support from weasel gove
nobodies was stopped from be able to speak everybody is free unless of cause your muslim as the right actually did bring in laws to stop them to publish whatever they what for near zero cost in the modern world what they dont get is the ability to not get called out for arsewholish behavour towards others
i never hear it used either and if someone called me it i would be quite annoyed
abi wilkinson i dont really believe in racism or sexism anymore i used to but not now all i can see these days is generalized hostility hiding under the many guises which it adapts theres always an excuse hes black shes a woman theyre country bumpkins theyre fat hes gay etc etc but that is all it is an excuse people enjoy sadism they enjoy being hostile they like being mean large sections of the population across all classes are stupid malicious hostile emotionally illiterate and emotionally irresponsible in the past the vast majority of the population was illiterate now they are not because we did something about it woman may not be perfectible but nor is she incorrigible neither education works wonders we could do something about this too
refusing to listen to contentious speakers especially at universities on the grounds that they might hurt somebodys feelings there is a balancing act to be sure no one deserves a platform simply because they have a reputation for being contentious they have to have something of substance to say something worthy to contribute to the debate we dont invite flatearthers to speak at universities for the sake of balance we dont balance truth as it has so far been revealed to us by science against wild speculation or provably false propaganda or religious proselytising or undiluted hate speech what does that teach students other than everything is mere opinion theres no such thing as truth the lie that we live in a posttruth society
what weve seen in  is that the national debate is being had on the watt level could you please tell us what specifically makes you more intelligent and your opinion more worthy than many of those here on cif and most of the people in the uk
thats a valid point actually
i think even intelligent people can overlook bad arguments if they like what is said and most of all if those arguments will support their having power over others as richard feynman put it the first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool
totally agree i hate it when they use that word and i keep saying and noone is listening it reminds me of school bullies
but were in a society where you have to say spokesperson not man or women or enjoy your holidays and winter festivals as oppose to christmas thats simply not true only idiots feel they cant say merry christmas and only liars claim they cant say it
were all clever and the nasty nonprogressives are all stupidlets just imagaine that were actually true and we are all dumb as toast is that our fault surely its as much an accident of birth as race or gender yet you people revel in insulting those you think are less inteligent than you while demanding safe spaces for every group who fits your list of trendy causes this week rank hypocrites
you have heard them all and decided they are ridiculous even before you had heard them au contraire i heard them all then decided theyre ridiculous
none are nicer than jimmy carter 
logic has been missing from public discourse ever since the early s scientists then first made the world aware there were limits to economic growth in the decades since evidence has mounted exponentially but most people especially those charge of policy and global business still brush this inconvenient truth away
if someone shouts fire then a whole bunch of other people shout ignore him there is no fire in the absence of smoke or any other evidence then most people carry on watching the film
ive never met any of those people and it wasnt referring to this subject but to those who people who despise political correctness usually want to rail against race relations gay rights gender equality etc strange in my experience the majority of people who claim to despise political correctness make a point of asserting their acceptance of different races sexualities etc
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged as opposed to the white straight femal and classprivileged who are completely innocent of any thought crime
its not a free choice if the objections to the invite are accompanied by threats
but i thought the whole point about the word queer was that the gay community had reclaimed it but there is no such thing as a community that can decide such a thing some people will be happy with the word queer and others will find it offensive that is the problem with the idea that offensive or even more ridiculously hate speech should be banned what is offensive to one person will not be to another and anything could be offensive to somebody the only solution is to allow freedom of all speech excluding only threats to actual physical harm
this controversy said as much about the money and power interests behind breitbart and other organs of american conservatism as what the moral arbiters of public sensibility decide can and cannot be said about sexuality
didnt say it was i said that was precisely the purpose of recategorising it as harm this seems contradictory if youre saying that people are calling it harmful in order to have it banned then absent of any specific call to have it banned the statement that it is harmful is not an inherent or implicit call for having it banned i think homophobic comments are harmful theres evidence that they are however i favour making the point and hoping people change their minds rather than banning it to insist that the statement that something is harmful is in itself done with the aim of banning it is to impose something on it which is not inherently there and doesnt seem too far removed from what you complain of
but i dont see how that invalidates my wishes it doesnt but the people who decide these new definitions of words dont care about the feelings of people like you and iwe are old so we dont count
political correctness politeness its banning books no platforming speakers and the like
and after microagressions becomes an established part of the lecicon of the professonallyoffended one wonders how long it will be before subatomic aggressions replaces it the benefit of this however would be that they would not exist if no one observed them being said
i think theres a more than subtle difference between a freedom to offend and aright not to be offended the second suggests that being offended is all you need to be able to shut down discussion it is enough to perceive a microaggression for it to exist and be real it think thats the main issue
even where incidences of campus censorship do seem egregious theyre limited in their impact factually correct but rather dismisses the actual fear which is that a generation is being taught at university that one viewpoint is fact amp truth and that different viewpoints are offensive invalid and shouldnt be tolerated the evaluation of whether this fear has any basis isnt based on what effect this has this week or next the timeframe from undergrad to cantankerous grizzled columnist is about  years my politics are right of centre amp i often become quite reactionary to some of the more nonsensical accusations and statements from the left but the ultimate truth is that on many issues the centre ground has to shift leftwards to make progress nhs civil rights many things that we now take for granted the problem is you dont change opinion by shutting down debate brexit is the most obvious indicator of that two decades of labour refusing to discuss the issue and labelling anybody racist that talked about immigration removed a pressure valve that has led to an overreaction im a brexiter amp i have long been because of the structure democratic deficit amp ideology of the eu these are the causes of the discontent that led to brexit but im not daft enough to think that was what triggered the out vote one of the biggest triggers was the effect of these problems which was immigration which because of the eu structures had no possibility to moderate now or to change that in future at the time remain were forced into a debate people had already made up minds amp they had already deemed the eu as incapable of dealing with the problem had the issue been talked about when it became an issue on the doorstep then wed have had  years to work within the eu or to come to a national consensus about the benefits vs the issues the current vogue for noplatforming and hysterical accusation is a ramping up of new labours approach and stands to cause even worse damage trump did a lot to create the unreality bubble with his birthers comments amp fox news insistence that obama was a muslim but that consisted of two main nonsense threads of attacks over an eight year term that didnt do a great deal to undermine the office i wouldnt like to estimate how many similar accusations have been made against trump so far by major organisations but i would expect it would be closer to  a week since his runoff with hilary started if you continually attack an elected president with accusations which you cant prove if you think the line where somebody cant express an opinion should be something other than the legal definition of incitement if you continually call people who are not racist racist and people who are not fascist fascist then you are a major part of slowing down any hope of progress you dont win arguments by baseless accusation
nobodies free speech has been limited whats happened is that you will get others exercising their free speech to tell that their repellent arses who belong in a bygone era thats not really the case is it the bulk of the criticism of those like hopkins or milo is not i disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it its much more youre causing anger and hurt you shouldnt be allowed to do that you should be silenced ironically hopkins and milo have deliberately gamed this kneejerk impulse to maximise their reach clicks and brand their outrageous statements are absolutely calibrated to get the twitter sjws reacting and by doing that unwittingly extending the reach of the shockjockeys
im definitely on the left of the political spectrum pro political correctness etc but this article worries me freedom of speech must mean just that people should be free to offend and to criticise others for doing so the recent trend for denying people a platform is really dangerous not least because if you cannot debate those with views other than your own you dont learn anything or even fully understand the society you live in it also gives people attention would milo whatever his name is really have such a large following at the moment if twitter didnt ban him im also sure that his sacking by briebart and the headlines it has caused will gain him new followers
quick to the ball pit
yes im afraid the word microaggression is rightly derided if you use the correct term a bit rude or thoughtless in my eyes it sort of puts it all into context
this is an increasingly irrelevant point of view
unless there is a fire of course
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening people have been sent to prison for their tweets thats evidence enough for me
katie hopkins and milo yinannapolous have bad ideas make bad arguments but have enough force of personality enough supporters and enough media executives willing to pay for controversy to propagate those bad ideas two individuals who have both been shown up as complete charlatans when given a platform and debated on television
the thing is you get frustrated with my tone but you have nothing to say to my points if i was wrong on brexit then you could convincingly point that out there is no argument that i any other brexiter or any politician could put forward that would even make its way even to the st mental barrier you have put in place to defend against all contrary opinions to your intractible paradigm you have heard them all and decided they are ridiculous even before you had heard them this is a major reason the remain campain lost a complete unwillingness to give even one iota of consideration to the opinions of people that have led different life experiences to them and therefore think differently much easier to simply despise such people you will of course not give that any consideration either and so the cycle of irrationally believing in ones own superiority and losing electionsreferendums will continue
words do and can cause harm perhaps not to you but guess what the world is full of whats called other people who think and feel differently to you some of them are and can be mentally fragile and words can harm them why do you think people commit suicide is it because they were punched in the face
i think having to say spokesperson is probably the hardest experience a person sorry man or woman can go through though getting over the abolition of christmas has been almost as difficult
well said
who stopped you from speaking we constantly have people talking about immigration and being allowed to say things all thats happening is that others are also using their right to free speech to call them out on things that society should consider as unpleasant and outside the pail but at no point was anybody stopped from speaking what your asking for is the right to not be criticized as you seem to think criticism equals censorship
unless of course there is a fire then youre ok unless youre the one lighting the fire whilst singing we didnt start the fire
voilà youve identified the problem of micoaggressions and being offended what you find personally offensive apparently doesnt offend many others in the gay community and also this newspaper how was this decided when was the vote was it  with another rd not voting at all or was it decided for everyone else by a group of noisy activists i guess your voice was appropriated and now youve been silenced things to think about since microaggressions may be claimed at a drop of a hat for any old subjective reason and who they offend and to what extent cant be determined lets make laws to appease some and thereby offend others seems reasonable pave that road
but a steam roller makes sure of it
apart from the results being pretty contradictory you dont get migrants without immigration you cant claim you are the majority and also are oppressed those  things do not go together so which one is true
but everyone has a right to exist sure but not in my neigbourhood if you dont mind we dont want that kind of thing round here thank you very much
hadley freeman does venture below the line occasionally i agree this would be a good habit for more writers to adopt
but you see the responsibility of that action lies with the perpetrator only not the forum you cant shut down the ability for people to voice their thoughts because someone somewhere might take it to the extremethats just batshit crazy
there are some readers on here who cannot tolerate anyone elses opinion but their own and the only thing they can resort to is abuse this country has become politically correct gone mad and people like katie hopkins whether you always agree with her or not should be aloud to have their say why is it that we have allowed preachers of hate to be interviewed or sit on a question time panel the hatred they spout is far worse
no saying something is harmful is not in itself to call for it to be banned i didnt say it was i said that was precisely the purpose of recategorising it as harm this is happening over various college campuses and universities in the western world people are suggesting they need to be protected from the very real harm that someone offended them by having a different opinion i invite you to do some research on what is getting banned otherwise youre essentially engaging in what you complain of labelling speech in itself as harmful ie in that it is a threat to our liberty speech can be harmful speech is not the threat to liberty that does not follow the threat is people recategorising speech to justify banning it
no i know i was just talking about why its unlikely that anyone is listened to theres too much of it and a lot of it is hostile hostility rarely leads to open discussion
when the focus is on individual words versus the meaning being conveyed there is little hope for progress there is no right to offend some people will always find offence at something its a given fact the spoken word is a powerful thing but lets over intellectualise it
thats not a leftright thing thats about how authoritarian someone is of course in britain we have an image of a slightly hippyish s or s left that arent very authoritarian thats not the full story
what next thought crime
so its correct to no platform and to shut down debate this is why people are moving to the right in droves
fire in a crowded cinema
populism is a sneering superior term suggesting that any majority opinion that disagrees with the correct liberal view is either stupid or racist or both currently used regularly by guardian journalists to describe anyone for brexit or who has any misgivings or concerns about immigration or islam i was among many people who argued against the holding of prisoners without trial in guantanamo bay lots of good people did this morning the guardian ran a piece that essentially inferred that the reason a man freed from guantanamo used his m compensation to fund isis put his family in danger and blew himself and others up was the fault of the daily mail the tories or tony blair the populist view is that islam bears a good chunk of responsibility any opinion suggesting that would never make it past the guardian editorial team
thought crime next
the problem with advocating further limits on free speech is the assumption that we will be the ones who decide what is acceptable and what is not in reality most of us ordinary people will never be in a position to influence what is considered acceptable speech but we will all be subject to its tyranny once its decided probably by extreme activists and the mass media maybe it will be jeremy corbyn who decides one day but then it could be donald trump the next we really must preserve every inch of our hard won freedoms and resist the urge to slide down this slippery slope
i think even intelligent people can overlook bad arguments if they like what is said
etiquette and the avoidance is offence have been the bedrock of civilisation for thousands of years the culture of entitlement that underpins political correctness does more to undermine unenforceable norms than anything however because instead of stigmatising rudeness it merely stigmatises it under certain conditions consequently many of the most hidebound pc warriors one comes across tend to be rude and inconsiderate
the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed thats simply not true is it for a start there are plenty of white straight male and poor and working class men who hate political correctness but add them in of course and then you wouldnt be able to say they were a demographic that has not historically been oppressed at which stage your comment falls apart i think youll find though that virtually all white hetero males including most guardian readers judging by comments on articles recently had got sick of the pc idea that white hetero males were the only people in the world it was ok to criticise
it is worth remembering that not so long ago we had a blasphemy law delivered via aks on the streets of paris its effect was sweeping it remains to this day and likely will be with us for a very long time to come so if ever there was a time for us all to become free speech absolutists then it was surely that moment instead the western media went lock step with the assailants and out of fear or acquiesce did their work for them its a position i can surely understand and in this paper nick cohen had the guts to admit that he was scared to transgress and had every reason to be but it was not framed so it was sold as a desire to not cause offence people seem to spend a lot more time talking about free speech than actually putting it to good use and when it really does become a matter of life and death we find that it isnt that important to us anyway a viewpoint that i can certainly understand but lament nonetheless
i dont mind not offending people with obvious insults thats just rude but were in a society where you have to say spokesperson not man or women or enjoy your holidays and winter festivals as oppose to christmas i think the above are what people are sick off but i fully expect this to go over the heads of lefties
the problem is that offence is entirely in the eye or ear of the beholder anyone can claim to be offended by anything they like or dislike the right to be offended like any other kind of right has limits and some people have misused it that is not to day that there should not be limits on what is acceptable public discourse but those who have awarded themselves the right to police the public discourse also have to accept discussion and criticism of their views i am no fan of ubiquitous expertoneverything germaine greer but the recent furore regarding her views on gender which are widely held in society and not obviously offensive to many was a good example of why there is the backlash of which you write
its sad to think that anyone would go out of their way to offend others although hopkins et al show that they do exist but the onus should be on the offender to determine whether they are also being hurtful id argue that in most cases offence and hurt are synonymous so just dont do it
gtits no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged a demographic that has not historically been oppressed this isnt true most of the white people criticizing political correctness are working class white male academics and journalists although valuable to society are more likely to bang their tambourine for the persistently offended you think white working class boys have it easy in society you think they arent dissuaded from aspiring to anything in life told their ambitions are quixotic their status in incapable of being transcended yet somehow they transcend asian immigrants in both the uk and usa who were at first poor and unskilled have also transcended and in the us are often ranked above whites in earnings etc it works both ways the number of antiwhite male articles on the guardian in recent years is appalling ive noticed that many of the nonwhite freelancers who have contributed such articles have often been educated at private schools which only reinforces the notion that class ie wealth is the determining factor here

the concept of microaggression is rubbish invented by the sjw crowd to silence their political opponents
im not even sure if it is the decision of the writer what article should be opened up for comments
but there not policing their speech milo hopkins and co are perfectly free to spout their bile all over the place what they do not have the right to is to not be protested against to have unlimited promotion of the speech wherever they want nobodies free speech has been limited whats happened is that you will get others exercising their free speech to tell that their repellent arses who belong in a bygone era
tend to agree with treflesg it irritates greatly when people reclaim queer like reclaiming to my ear theres no getting away from the fact queer historically means weird or strange there is nothing weird or strange about men loving men happily is something gay about it
yes yes we will win the victory over ourselves we will love big brother
who decided it was takeni was never askedlgbtq why is one of those words considered ok suddenly to be used to describe the other ones why have q in the lgbt list if it is a superword that describes all of us
but i thought the whole point about the word queer was that the gay community had reclaimed it queer studies were being taught in my rg university in the s heres the goldsmiths ma in queer history the emphasis of the ma is in the early modern and modern periods both the western invention of homosexuality in the s and the emancipatory movements especially of the post poststonewall period figure prominently you will study core explorations and debates in queer history learn research skills and methods and write a dissertation optional modules may include global queer subjectivities and how homosexuality was invented in late thc germany and conquered the world
also when views are silenced like those of the bnp they start claiming victimhood and that they dont want you to hear our truth silencing views no matter how wrong they are gives them credence instead of disappearing they gain strength as no one properly argues against them when nick appeared on newsnight there were protests and howls against giving him a platform that turned out well for him and the bnp they got shown up as having views built on sand every time you no platform someone or stop their views being heard and argue against them a large number of people think why do they not want me to hear this get them in a debate and find someone who can properly argue against them it is a far more powerful weapon
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening false evidence the uk today has far stricter pornography censorhip legislation than countries in the eu
you lost me at the first use of the word microagressions and that was in the subtitle so that was as far as i got i think that i must have been triggered somehow
sticks and stones may break my bones ___ ______ ___ _____ ___ __ i wonder how many millenials can even finish this sentence
but noplatforming is not the same as dictating the limits of acceptable speech correct noplatforming is just one manifestation of the wider drive to define acceptable speech with acceptable being defined as something no identity group could plausibly claim to be offended by i dont even know why were still talking about this i mean the identity liberalism movement tangibly failed
it certainly doesnt mean that males may be any less sexist in their attitudes charming
by gettin a black eye
it gets on my tits
ive been using they for unspecified singulars for ever and have been teaching my students to do so as well i dont really see the problem of applying the same principle to nonbinary persons if they so wish
noooooooooooo sexism and gender imbalance can be challenged without resorting to the lazy use of they in the singular person for english some languages have nongender specific pronouns but they tend to rely on the verb to specify i find that by alternating she and he in nonspecific use challenges people quite nicely referring to susan as they just sounds stupid

i am mystified as to where the guardian finds some many fringetype people who also feel compelled to write about themselves such as this one who describes herself as a liberal feminist grammarnerd
why dont we just switch and use she for the next say  yearsit will be nice for men to have a pronoun that is reserved just for them
the premise is that we need a neutral word and by the third paragraph we find we have had one since  even if the americans had not realised for  years the rest of the article would appear superfluous but we would not learn that such widely spoken languages as turkish hungarian finnish persian and pipil are genderless french gives tables and chairs genders but got on quite well and we got the gender pay gap in even if everyone knows its really about child rearinghow about an article saying man made global warming is a sexist term thought not because its regarded as a bad thing
even within context sentences can remain ambiguous if youre going to introduce a new function word into grammar why not create a new element like the swedish did
pronouns equal pay and rape are they equally important
may i suggest a lead duck sirmadamit
i totally agree and i think most sensible people do consider gender to be a social construct and dont buy into gender stereotypes
you mean it wastes its intellect for all we know it might be a male or a female or a shemale or a trans or a th gender look it up or asexual or antisexual or boris johnson
there are lots of medieval tower houses too which i think were to protect from pirate raids stunning buildings and the dovecotes are lovely too
the push for it is not new feminists and those who wish to avoid the possibility of referring to a female as a male have been advocating this option for decades
i love it i use it whenever i can when debating with the pc fanatics they are all it to me and for some unfathomable reason this infuriates them but isnt this just what they want

hmmmm using the word they to me makes me think there is a group of people probably essentuated by the anyone at the front of the sentence
some more than others to be fair public health care for one has historically been generally good for social mobility
i am still grateful to guardian columnist laura penny who urged me to drop he and she and use xe instead thatll show they
abolishing he and she makes it often impossible to determine whether youre talking about a plurality of people or a singular person take they are over there thats essentially impossible to reword to talk about just one person without using he she or it if we want a genderneutral language people need to get more comfortable by being referred to as it or we need to invent a new word which is unlikely to happen anytime soon
so nowadays the mere acknowledgment of the existence of biological sexes is sexism no wonder this leaky pc boat is sinking faster than a fast sinking thing
wait until the writer notices that they has a secret he in the middle
well i am sorry that it sounds wrong to you because it isnt wrong this is not at all political i am not grinding a feminist axe i am simply reporting current usage and indeed this has been in use for a long time you understand i am sure that in any case that language is not immutable but changes and evolves if there is a lack in a language in this case a neuter singular rd person pronoun for referencing humans it is to be expected that common usage will fill that gap and will in time become accepted usage grammar is my profession you do not however have to believe me look it up yourself
it may cause offence if an individual is referred to as they as if their gender cannot be identified these are fragile times and using the passive and omitting pronouns seems like the only way to ensure offence is not caused
the thing about obama is a e from the article the caption under the picture
they has long been used in the singular in english but not to denote genderlessness one of the earliest examples comes from geoffrey chaucer in  who wrote in the pardoners tale and whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame they wol come up
what a load of bollocks
ive always used they as a genderless singular and noones ever commented dunno it just makes sense
the author is clearly a bright girl what a shame she wastes her intellect on this trivia
ive been using they like this for ages always i think its an obvious thing to do surely
i call every man woman and child i meet jackie works fine leave it out john
place your bets ladies and gentlemen
excuse me but im sure you must be mistaken i learned that there are actually only two really important things about which we must be concerned this is one of them never use he him or his for impersonal singular pronouns always use they them and theirs instead secondly antisemitism labour has a huge problem with antisemitism always put that in allcapital letters to indicate importance i learned this in the guardian nothing else is of much importance just those two things and everything else takes care of theirselves or goes to hell whatever
you certainly dont seem to have any problem using the first person pronoun thats for sure
exactly that is why in german speaking countries germanistik studies include english
i dont think its sexist to use he or she and nobody anylonger assumes that the doctor is male or the nurse is femalemost people already do use they in a singular formthere was an article in the economist about this some ten years agoto state that the english language is inherently sexist is rather strange we have it he and she and a lot of my american friends consciously rephrase to use oneto refer to other languages doesnt help each language has its own history after all it surprises a lot of europeans that english only has one you formi get worried when people are so selfrighteously convinced of their own beliefs that they insist everybody convert to their way of thinking very common in the ukusa with their puritan traditions the road to hell is paved with good intentions and  is there as a warning of what the thought police can lead tohaving said that this is an interesting article and the writer admits i still dont know how to talk about this without inspiring fights
apparently not in the us
i dont think that was the point of the article i think shes arguing for they to refer to a customer etc its an american articledebate we already use the term in uk i also agree about they for a specific singular
i suspect that if a majority of the people on this nest read the famous story about the four flatmates and the job that had to be done they would end up agreeing that everybodys behaviour was an appalling case of bullying and nobody ought to go on strikehttpwwwfartinvitecomlolzddccacfacffaccajpg

so how would you say in ame someones left this parcel on the doorstep but why didnt they ring the bell or knock on the door in my comment i should of course have said  as a generlaising third person singular
having a gender neutral word for thirdperson singular in finnish hän has never been seen as problematic and as others here have mentioned it certainly doesnt mean that males may be any less sexist in their attitudes but a nice aside is where hän has been used as a literary devise so as to create ambiguity where one deliberately doesnt know the gender of the protagonist the finnish writer pirkko saisio for one has done that occasionally needless to say it would be difficult to translate such literature into english perhaps instead using unisex names such as beverly evelyn hilary or lynn
i tend to agree sexism is an inherent bias against one gender in favour of another for example imagine a newspaper that had endless dreary articles about one sex but a very sparse helping of equivalent dreary articles about the other sex that could supposedly be said to be a sexist newspaper best to ignore these articles on first sight note to self
i totally disagree tons of smart people think deeply about language usage questions like these which is very important on this particular they question mignon fogarty grammar girl bill walsh copyeditor of the washington post and author of several great language books and bryan garner writer of the grammar and usage section the chicago manual of style all have thoughtful things to say
most of my friends and colleagues are blissfully ignorant of the rule to which ms berry refers its been years since i heard a person say if anyone wants to help with the bake sale he can set up tables they has already won the day
clearly american they is commonly used as a genderless singular pronoun in the uk american author american audience
genderless phrase example they give birthsorted
default pronoun he definitely not only has gender but specifically tells us that the person referred to is male except it just doesnt as we all know if we didnt know that we would have no idea what you meant by default pronoun or have a clue what the article was about
i totally agree people do use they because it does cover all genders and plural and singular its usually fairly evident when its being used in this generalised way and when it does refer to the plural only it also avoids the awful hesheit combination however to suggest that we should move to abolish he she and it strikes me as ridiculous it would involve a loss of ability to be precise in our meaning equally including the feminine within the masculine form again loses precision and makes me wonder why we then bother with any but the male forms some languages get by perfectly well without using the articles the and a however they lose precision i have heard students of english from those languages say that they appreciate the precision given by articles and wish their own languages did have them
they works fine for a nonspecific person a doctor a person a customer but not with a named concrete person and i think most people would agree that the sentence the moment maria munir told barack obama they were nonbinary looks rubbish it seems to imply that both maria munir and barack obama are nonbinarysorry maria but if you have a girls name im going to use female pronouns to talk about you
in the past i have tried solving the problem of inherent sexism in language by alternating male and female pronouns when referring to generic professions where i refer to a patient as he in one sentence i may refer to his doctor as she in the next because im one of the rabid feminists of which oxford dictionaries speaks i make certain that my generic shes are not always in positions of vulnerability this sounds like the ramblings of someone with a serious mental illness
do you _always_ follow the latest fashion in this casewhere over centuries the fashion has changed back and forthhow do you decide which fashion trend youll follow if later he and him return to style for the impersonal singular youll change and adopt it is there an app for this
eh they is already a singular pronoun i feel compelled to reply to this comment they clearly do not fully grasp the english language
one isnt sexist is one
who says the author is left wing she is a feminist presumably socially liberal but theres nothing in this article to suggest she is left wing
tldr
oddly enough all the their examples from fowler sound perfectly natural to me except the fielding one which id probably say as everyone in the house was in their beds fowler was a great advocate for common sense in grammar so he generally formed his opinions on style from the best examples that he could find in use anyway but i would have said the same as you that one in everyone cries out for the singular form of the verb on a side note i love his little digs at grammarians which are a necessary form of running joke throughout the book and observations such as a boldness surprising in a government department that spread a big wry smile across my face
yes exactly i dont think its new in the uk
the passive voice gets really confusing sometimes but in most cases the nongendered general person tied to a he or she can be made plural and then they is with grammatically correct and gender nonspecific in some specific cases a person might prefer to be referred to as they and in that case it should be done but its rare and very specific usage
personhole covers
in french if you refer to a person une personne you use elle whether male or female because personne has female gender in contrast you can use lhomme to mean man in the sense of homo sapiens including people of either any gender there have been some changes le maire the mayor and le ministre the government minister were always masculine even if used to describe a woman but now it seems accepted to refer to la maire la ministre etc in terms of pronouns il and elle do have gender but ils they masculine plural refers to any group of people elles feminine plural indicates that the group is allfemale
it has been suggested that pronouns he and she should be replaced by it this is ok when referring to animals but political correctness would never tolerate it when applied to nonbinary people and rightly so
oh dear  the person is fictional all the people are in fact including me the story is a joke it is an example of playing with language such as the interchange between the choleric major who has lost his train of thought and his stenographer in catch or the moment in monty pythons spanish inquisition sketch where cardinal jimenez interrogating the old lady repeats confess confess confess until cardinal biggles finally cracks and cries out i confessthe relevancy of castellano grammar is that english teachers often notice in spain is that spanishspeakers often end up saying things like my mother lives in your house because the possessive adjective su can mean your his her its or their and this makes it quite easy for spanishspeakers to end up getting very muddled and yet despite this somehow we all manage to understand each other in spain and with a certain amount of goodwill and understanding you can turn what would quite possibly be grounds for taking offence in the englishspeaking world into a chance to have a giggle in which most spaniards being in general cheerful and jovial people will readily join in since people here tend to have the very healthy attitude of laugh and the world laughs with you weep and you weep alone as soon as i saw this article i thought theres some comic potential in this alas i had not taken into account the miserablist puritanism which so often characterises the keyboard warriors on these pages
how is it pronounced
that often doesnt work though referring to a women as he regardless of if its offensive or not just sounds confusing
i suggest using the passive and omitting pronouns altogether it is agreed with
episyrphus is it also worth pointing out that the term gender in language has nothing to do with sex necessarily some languages have many genders do they thats interesting which for example
any use of language that excludes us by gender race sexuality or religion seems unlikely if an organisation is defined by using womens or black in its very name then thats exclusionary to men or members of other ethnic groups for instance
thats very interesting why does they sound better in the second example than if you put it in the first if john or may comes they is it because although were to come is singular we are so used to were denoting the rd person plural in contrast to rd person singular that it doesnt grate on the ears so much
anyway you cut it they is a plural pronoun for singular use he she or it and dont take your precious selves so seriously 
do they thats interesting which for example
a universal singular pronoun just makes so much more sense i recently emailed a company referencing previous emails with their staff i wrote a bunch of hes and then realised the person i was referring to was actually a women so had to go back through the entire email switching gender pronouns such a tedious exercise and an example of language hindering communication rather than helping over history english has changed countless times to remove such communication blockers and increased usage of the singular they is just this traditional continuing
toomuchreality presumably languages without genderspecific pronouns have had exemplary nonsexist cultures for centuries the article proposes a causal link but unless such cultures exist the argument is surely disproved meanwhile we should relax and go on using he she or they as we see fit totally ignoring the first world preoccupations of a handful of feminists chinese has three pronouns for he she and it but they are all pronounced the same tā tā tā though written slightly differently 他 她 它 i dont think it has made any improvement to the status of women in traditional chinese society
of course it sounds wrong to me at my house it was would you please see who is at the door  or please answer the door and then on being informed please ask him ask her ask them only if they arent a single individual to come in or indeed someones at the door would you please go and let him in my parents corrected my grammar throughout my life and im grateful to them for that does a child actually use the singular they or their on his or in new feministspeak their own ab initiowithout prompting what happens when the little darlings misspeak and say his or him no correction in good feminist patriarchyfighting homes
people have been using they that way for years its common and perfectly acceptable usage anyone who thinks otherwise is simply and obviously wrong im not sure we needed this article in the circumstances
okay ill take you on to boil it down its deeply unhelpful to default to the male gender particularly in formal contexts and contributes to an oppressive and damaging atmosphere where the male is unremarkable whereas the female is extraordinary take the shorter oxford textbook of psychiatry which for various academic reasons i have had to read pretty much from cover to cover the authors have a little aside at the beginning stating that in the use of he for patients and psychiatrists they are not assuming that either party is male but rather that the correct use of english is to use he when gender is not specified we couldnt possibly use they titter phillip paul and tom as that would be ungrammatical he is perfectly fine because it assumes nothing about the gender of the person and readers will of course understand that everywhere they use he they really mean he or she except for the chapter on eating disorders then all of a sudden the patient is a she the gender used for a pronoun absobloodylutely implies something about the gender of its subject and it hurts to have the  of psychiatrists who are women and the  of depression patients who are female and the  of anorexia patients who are male to be airily erased from the narrative just because of a male someones idea of what looks neater or more formal look if the distinction was entirely without historical weight not informed by centuries of power politics doing oppressive damage to women and men including directly by psychiatry itself hysteria im looking at you then this might be an academic point and im sure the authors would be horrified if you suggested that women couldnt be psychiatrists or that male anorexia patients werent deserving of compassion and help but even though its a small thing its cumulative and speaks to an ingrained disrespect that doesnt even arise from conscious action but the privilege of never having to apologise for your gender or make assumptions about your audience of operating in academic circles where you and your consultant colleagues and your phd students and other professors are overwhelmingly male a psychiatrist must be prepared to use his wits might be correct and proper but it also requires perhaps half of the readership to do the exhausting mental dance of  wait he oh hang on i still count its just he being used in the genderless context right lets move on over  pages its draining over a lifetime of formal academic writing well the reader can judge for himself cant he

incorrect use of pronouns is equal to an act of violence i suggest using the passive and omitting pronouns altogether
just want to add that i absolutely dont have a problem with using they as a gender neutral singular pronoun but its silly to act as if it was an important frontier in the fight against sexism

i rather that banks and other institutions that cling to sir or madam just added an extra field of preferred form of address on their inevitable database im not fond of being called sir mr smith was my dad and the call centre cockwombles get hung up on if they immediately start in with mate or the these days almost inevitable buddy i have a name find out what it is then use it if they cant be arsed and revert to sir or madam neither can i be arsed to take their call or read their letter
the english language does not have grammatical gender it is and has been for centuries a convention of the language that male pronouns refer to people of any gender unless the context admits to the contrary this is not a sexist conspiracy by the patriarchy however much we might want to pin the blame on men for all of societys ills in fact one might wonder whether people wittering on about complete nonissues such as this is the sexist conspiracy by the patriarchy because all it does is deflect attention from actually important issues

does this guy you know not know whether he is a man or a woman heres a clue in fact two of them  i live in spain where i generally speak castellano  i have spent a great deal of my life earning a living by teaching english to spaniards is that a yes or a no then not very clear are you
anglophilede maybe in yorkshire tha knows
yes it is perfectly correct however as you also know the subjunctive is not a tense in english and therefore there is no conjugation it is usage that has determined that in the subjunctive mood i were is correct now of course if i was you is also acceptable usage
ah howryis is better then hey hows everyone yes in my original post i was writing the scots as it would be rendered in english though that said we do actually use yous at times however yes howuryis would be a very common utterance in scotland
or el guardián shows you how crap my spanish is
i think people with the authors viewpoint might be unaware how bizarre this sounds to anyone outside of the insular circles they move in since when did we on the left have to pay so much heed to academics from the soft sciences what happened to representing the actual working class
another solution is for the writer to denote their own gender by using he or she but yes they is fine
no i dont really see why the vast majority of the population has to change the way it speaks to a clumsy playschool endless repetition of someones name what if it was archibald you wouldnt keep saying archibald archibald archibald just to assuage the hypersensitivities of a statistically insignificant minority
i just cant fathom how people can not see how absolutely absurd it is to argue that a genderless language should have any influence on the level of sexism in a society the article even points out that we do have genderless languages in the world do we see any indication any evidence at all that societies with such languages are less sexist for gods sake farsi turkish how silly can this argument get
hi john interesting post though my point and the rhetorical question was based on the fact that in english you can actually engage in discourse based around gender neutrality a lot easier than you can in spanish or french just by the core design of english it is a lot further in regards gender neutrality as is mandarin chinese than a lot of the romance language family and russian if the guardian or la guarda was operating out of madrid they would have a field day with their hand wringing
the link below the  worst colleges in the us for free speech examples include on november  the fordham united student government usg senate and executive board approved a prospective students for justice in palestine sjp chapter dean of students keith eldredge informed sjps members that he wanted to review the groups status before it could be granted official recognition and then chose to overrule the usg and deny sjps recognition on december  eldredge wrote that he cannot support an organization whose sole purpose is advocating political goals of a specific group and against a specific country and that the israelipalestinian conflict often leads to polarization rather than dialogue httpswwwthefireorgfireannouncesamericasworstcollegesforfreespeech
great post the death of the bnp followed swiftly after griffins appearance on question time could be coincidence i suppose the best response to a bad argument is a good argument in my view not pretending that bad argument does not exist or trying to ban it if speech can harm does it follow that it can also heal if so then the response to abuse could be words of support and encouragement from others
yes probably some people would from the oxford guide to style ation marks also called inverted commas are of two types single and double british practice is normally to enclose ed matter between single ation marks and to use double ation marks for a ation within a ation ation marks are not used around the names of sacred texts or their subdivisions musical works identified by description or houses or public buildings chequers cosicot the barley mow use ation marks and roman not italic type for titles of short poems and of tv and radio programmes and for titles of chapters in books and articles in periodicals mr brock read a paper on description in poetry professor bradley read a paper on jane austens juvenilia its all very confusing
why did his comments need addressing cant you just disagree with him without this sjw need for victims and punishment what did it really achieve in the end
youre totally missing the main point being made here which amounts to thismilos is beneath me he is unter to my uber so he should not have the same rights as i he offends me so therefore must be removed this is mainly about superiority its very funny
i think fake news needs to be stopped trump should put an order in that the media isnt allowed to lie and has some controls its a weapon that is the main point information is being weaponized and constant fake news by the media actually does a lot of harm and divides the country and yet you just posted the above make up your mind which is it to be statesanctioned censorship or the first amendment

okay chunky if it makes you feel happy then by all means produce a sentence like your last one it combines utter meaninglessness with a complete absence of evidence since you fail to define what you mean by smarter and stupider who can possibly argue with youbut until you do try to define them then what you say isnt worth a tinkers fartim not trying to look good for feminists or anybody else why should iim always amused by that new expression virtue signalling its taken the place of bleeding hearts as a catchall expression used by people who are unable to frame their true arguments in such a way as not to appear ignorant stupid or bigotedin other words if you say something offensive and someone disagrees then you can accuse them of virtuesignalling and it makes you rightperhaps we should respond by caling you indifferencesignalling its slightly less cutting than accusing you of nastinesssignallingperhaps you might tell us all what virtues my remarks signal and why they should offend youive always believed virtue to be a positive attributeare you right wingers now trying to redefine our moral universe anyway the plain truth is that the way we try to define intelligence is culturally subjective there is no onesizefitsall template
powerful have exerted influence on what you should be allowed to hear throughout humanitys existence there is no slippery slope here some version of the struggle between the principle of free speech vs the consequences of speech have accompanied us since the dawn of time and likely always will i dont see any perceptive points in this article but its hardly introducing some novel new position on free speech that differs from the status quo
wow this is exactly the hypocritical nightmare that pc has spawned the mental contortions required to think that article is ok yet the reverse would be racist is impressive if ultimately shit for the world
youve missed the point communication is a transaction you have the power to determine how much you receive from another instead of being offended we should be controlling our emotions and not taking the negativity from others comments let their words be a train that stops at your station but no passengers get out unless you want them to then we can have totally open discussions without the need for childish curtailments of liberties such as pc
the media is only doing what the media has always done scrutinising and holding those in power to account he does deserve fair coverage but in choosing to go further than other past presidents in actively discrediting and delegitimising him he feeds the narrative that they are against him and closes down any potential for reasoned analysis of him and his policies theyre also not his base neither they nor their readership so he feels he can only strengthen his support by making this a binary choice he did also come to power on a very confrontational agenda that sought to identify certain groups for particular treatment ethics do have degrees of objectivity attached to them ands not all policies are evenly legitimate no matter what the will of the people who voted for them may feel and not all are in accordance with the founding or sustaining principles of western democratic societies the media and judiciary are organs of the state that are their to restrain and critique and speak for the greater state over its transient manipulation at the hands of one single administration the powerful billionaire isnt used to hearing things he doesnt like hell have to get used to it unfortunately
what complete and utter pernicious drivel
oh wind your neck in im neither male or a troll
as soon as either side descends into violence it is no longer a free speech issue an obviosity
they are terrible and despicable organisations for lack of a better word but i agree they should be condemned with words and arguments not laws
i didnt say ban it i just said it made it unusable so i wont use itmainly thats what i tend to do with stuff i dont like if i find theres a load of jerks on twitter ill go make some fucking fairy cakes with unicorns and glitter on them to cheer myself up if theres some dicks on here ooooohhh about  recurring of users and im bored of the morons ill go pick daisies duh
and then loads of you slag off the guardian while coming to the guardians website to complain that the guardian is not allowing you a voice are you too dense not to see the contradiction in this if you object to sticking to the guardians community rules then why dont you fuck off to another website your argument here isnt much more legitimate that countering every criticism of the uk government with a then fuck off to siberia
hmm never been quite convinced by that one it denies any kind of objective assessment of the rights and wrongs of actionsspeech and also discounts the motives and intent of the speaker placing all significance on the reaction and not the action misses a huge part of it to me particularly when were talking at societal level and not just about personal interactions where various forms of offensiveness spring from institutionalized prejudices with power structures maintaining them i dont think the rather arbritrary factor of the listeners subjective reaction can really be the measure of that there are reasons for the behaviour being a problem which apply regardless of how thick skinned or not the person they targeted is its true enough that on an individual level when were talking about hurt feelings an insult you are unmoved by has little to no power on your mood or your view of yourself i really wouldnt say thats the only measure of the behaviour though
once again btl is the letters page your voluntarily submitted written content being or not being published in it is not an issue of free speech
deplorables of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chains some readers here will know the source of the original ation the guardian might usefully spend some time exploring how it was that donald trump came to be the man winning election on this platform
i think fake news needs to be stopped trump should put an order in that the media isnt allowed to lie and has some controls its a weapon that is the main point information is being weaponized and constant fake news by the media actually does a lot of harm and divides the country
yesterday the guardian published an enthusiastic article about the modest fashion revolution as a lot of commenters pointed out a this implied women who dont wear such outfits are immodest b the whole concept of modest islamic dress is that women have to cover up to prevent men losing control of their sexual urges thus making women responsible for mens selfcontrol beyond belief that the guardian described islamist clothing in the islamists own language i notice they didnt leave the comments open on that one for very long as one of yesterdays commenters said the insult is passive aggressive but it is a sly smiling insult nonetheless
everything should be open for criticism and analysis under conditions of reasoned debate on conceptually equal termseverything except boris johnsons commentsit seems
that is the problem with many on the right they conflate their freedom of speech with a supposed freedom to a platform and further freedom to be free from criticism nowhere in my statement did i ever say that speech should be free from critisim all i said is that they should have the right to say what they believe in
i think people dont realize that freedom of speech is something to be respected its a powerful right and therefore something that should be used responsibly mind the elephant trap this suggests that its a freedom so allpowerful anddemanding of such repect that it requires someone to ensure that it is only used responsibly which would be me obviously not you
it is being challenged here in the west in canada through m offensive speech will be censored this includes using the the wrong pronoun ffs criticism of islam is considered hate speech keep arguing for free speech dont get complacent
you know its called the slippert slope fallacy right
tarek fatah gad saad ayan hirsi ali sarah haider there are loads of articulate and brave opponents of what is often known as the regressive left they all oppose the far right too they all also understand that the strength of ones argument has nothing to do with your race sex etc
so i take it your fully behind the moderation policy on here and fully behind fb not letting pictures of any naked kids on fb too because you think being rude should be enough to get someone banned from social mediaand they wonder why they get called snowflakespass the twin set and pearls mary whitehouse feels offended over here
 this is one of the primary mistakes far left uni students are making as well as far right ideologues who cannot see further than the nose on their facebalance my dear friendbalance
there is literally no evidence for this claim and if and its a big if that was true trump did not end it he spend years lying about something that is doing no one a favour if someone were to say that you were a thief and i spent  years telling everyone you were a thief and that i had proof but that i wasnt going to show anyone and then decided that id changed my mind would you say i was doing you a favour because that is what you are claiming
the media cant just lie to suit their agenda i am just saying the media should be fairer to trump he is the leader of this country chosen by the people he deserves more respect if the media stop lying about trump and were positive as i think he deserves for a yhear or two the country would unite behind trump if the people show him loyalty trump will reward the people
i find it astonishing that so many people here seem to think that language and the way language can be used has no power and its all harmless because its all only words isnt it and the only harm that can possibly be done to you or anyone else is if someone physically assaults you for goodness sake language is the most powerful weapon any society or government can wield there was a whole lot of language going on before the holocaust ever happened or could ever have happened for example there was a whole lot of language going on before pol pot managed to carry out the slaughter of millions a child who has never been beaten by their parents can still suffer horrendous abuse and be severely damaged merely by the use of language meanwhile those who rail against what they say is political correctness and imagine all these evil lefties around who are stopping them from saying what they want to say who are these imaginary people what exactly do you want to say that anyone has ever prevented you from saying please be specific and so many of you seem to be so precious about your right to offend a question might be why you are unable to express your viewpoints without feeling the need to be offensive and then loads of you slag off the guardian while coming to the guardians website to complain that the guardian is not allowing you a voice are you too dense not to see the contradiction in this if you object to sticking to the guardians community rules then why dont you fuck off to another website why are you all so obsessed with the guardian in particular which is actually pretty much a minority voice do you really really want the whole of the news media to conform to your own point of view certainly seems like it believe it or not freedom of speech also extends to those who object to racists sexists homophobes extreme rightwingers etc so stop whingeing that youre being silenced if other people call you out on your views and dont start whining about your freedom of speech you have freedom of speech you do not have the right for your opinions to go unchallenged
not allowed by whom
i believe that they have the right to state their views in public just as i believe that others have the right to call them out as scum as soon as either side descends into violence it is no longer a free speech issue
maybe but when the left defends islamwhose creed contains many beliefs it is supposedly against it makes itself look ridiculous that is a sweeping generalisation it is only the extreme elements of islam that give it a bad name just as the extremes of either side of the right left divide do
yeah think not but you missed the point seems to have become your standard response when you cant come up with anything better
bullshit he was banned for being an obnoxious jerkfunny how this paper went doolal about fb censorship and people here scream blue murder about the mods but are totally into milos being banned for the crime of obnoxious jerk not moderated banned for being a dick
literally dont know if anybody can possibly say that and be serious brilliant your trigger has been triggered apparently doesnt take much to send you off to your safe space huh
clinton started the birther movement and noone blames her trump just ended up he did obama a favor by ending the debate that hilary clinton had started
oh behave with the ukip victim nonsense yes well done thats exactly the type of accusation of racistxenophobetrumpistbrexiter designed to shut down whatever comment was being made
if you know how to use apostrophes people value your views more
this is the slipperiest of all slopes while its commendable to prevent upsetting people making it law as many who make these arguments want it leaves me worrying who makes the choice on what is offensive and ultimately what im allowed to hear in public discourse would i trust the likes of the author to decide what i should be allowed to hear because it may be offensive either to me or someone else its a very dangerous road in my view and one against the very core liberal ideals
so youre suggesting that those who are the target of abuse and disrespect should man up and take it
to clarify it did get coverage id heard about a child sex abuse scandal in rotherham and that it had been perpetrated by a gang of mainly pakistani men but i hadnt heard that investigation had been impeded by this specific motive
if you dont completely support the right of the westboro baptist church and the kkk to advocate and state their views and protest in public then dont even bother saying you believe in freedom of expression
virtuesignalling is a brilliant piece of language we knew there was something irritatingly smug about the way the progressive left were communicating i wholeheartedly thank whoever had the genius to encapsulate so pithily this essence once named it can be called out
you want to live in a country where the media do not hold leaders to account when they are dishonest north korea awaits you
the hypothetical threat of a subset of people enforcing strict rules that limit our ability to express ourselves is terrifying i agree i just dont think theres much evidence of that happening could that be because you are a columnist and dont post btl in this very paper
if you feel some speech should be censored then as far as im concerned you dont stand for free speech if you think that free speech means the right to a platform to speak from you do not understand what free speech even means that is the problem with many on the right they conflate their freedom of speech with a supposed freedom to a platform and further freedom to be free from criticism
why hes the president not your friend respect is due to the office respect for the person is earned this is a man who pretended lied that he had proof the previous president wasnt american and was therefore ineligible for the office he didnt just say he thought this he claimed to have evidence this was a lie a non truth something he made up trump will get balanced coverage which by that i think you mean positive when he does positive things the president and his staff keep lying being called out on lying isnt unfair
humour bypass
its no coincidence that the loudest voices against political correctness tend to be white straight male and classprivileged again guardian i am sorry for being a white male what is worse than the backlash against political correctness attributing the blame to one demographic of the population who will in turn be lambasted for being born ps milo yiannopoulos not straight katie hopkins not male two of the most outspoken critics of political correctness
i think that lets them off the hook to conveniently theyre fearless defenders of free speech up until they are not and yet its the fault of others as to why they feel unable to speak out now if its not hypocrisy its cowardice neither of which give them much credibility in any future claims as to the importance of free speech as you say i dont think his arguments actually condone paedophilia and given that similar arguments have been made in these pages its clear that its not a topic that is completely incapable of discussion in public and so it shouldnt be too difficult to make that point in somewhere like breitbart or spiked if they had a genuine commitment to free speech of course its no little irony that milo has met the same fate as that he has encouraged for others the power of the press and powerful individuals targeting individuals for ridicule and condemnation he has named trans people for mockery and criticism at his own lectures but it doesnt excuse it what it does show up is the amount of inconsistency or hypocrisy by those who claim high minded principles
wow you are really caught in your own echo chamber there milo enjoys baiting the left because the left acts like a prudish school marm circa the victorian era he has been necessary and the left must take some responsibility for his creation you criticise altright concepts as a pretty big ask but fail to see that pc has become too big an ask hence brexit and trump your views are not the norm i think the guardian writers and the progressive left really dont realise this your opinions and concepts are a big ask too there has been a real arrogance on many topics where the left has attempted just to shut things down talk about immigration is racist and xenephobic regardless of content politics of identity has been a favoured weapon btl pc has led to namecalling rather than open discourse hope open discourse isnt too big an ask of you now that you have lost at the ballot convincingly twice over
whats the difference between free speech and completely free speech
as a left leaning person myself my issue is the amount of time a certain section of the left waste on this stuff maybe the reason the left isnt as powerful as theresa mays government is because we waste too much time on frivolous nonsense rather than doing actual work focus on jobs the environment health care etc i appreciate we are capable of worrying about more than one thing at a time but this newspaper spends an inordinate amount of time and energy and presumably money on no platforming microaggeression etc this stuff is nonsense and demonstrates an over sensitivity as well as an insistence on speaking for other people
he criticised her thats a very liberal use of the word criticism calling some ugly etc isnt criticism its just rude however it does not amount to racism or antisemitism thats why i didnt call it antisemitic but if you dont see how the whole notion of cuckservatism is steeped in racist and sexist imagery i really have no idea what is that chilling effect on free speech i dont find it particularly chilling to ban people who make a habit of insulting others i mean id throw them out of my house without a second thought why shouldnt twitter people tend to confuse that with censorship censorship is when the government with all its accumulated coercive power police prisons etc forbids the publication of something because it believes a certain political standpoint to be dangerous and while you could make the point that large media corporation like twitter have similar coercive power this is and thats the important part not about shutting down a political position its about shutting down someone who is systematically rude and intrusive i mean could you even name a single substantial political stance milo holds apart from i should be allowed to say everything offensive that crosses my mind alternatively you could call everything the government prohibits to go into print censorship from child pornography and malicious falsehoods libel to violations of privacy laws publishing a persons past illnesses sexual preferences bank account number you can do that but im not sure that under that definition there would be many opponents of censorship left
thanks for the honest reply i was going to ask how you were not aware of it but in fairness i live in south yorkshire so this was major local news even if it somehow didnt get as much national coverage as i would now assume
they even pen articles about muhammed being a feminist the eyerolling induced by that one may have caused a few injuries id wager i should have read your second sentence first
he wasnt banned from twitter for being racist but for being misogynistic which he happily admits to and encouraging others to abuse people you are all over the place here like someone rather overly fond of the sound of their own voice check your facts
on here you can see how many comments have been censored on the dm site they never appear only the poster knows that their comment hasnt made it do you really believe what you have written in your reply
no he doesnt dont expect him to read your links hes a troll
beware the telescreen really look up the recent news stories about vizio
fair enough seems like a fear of being labelled racist actually did impede proper investigation i concede the point
the notion of a microaggression is a way to silence people its saying i know that what youve said isnt racist misogynist homophobic etc etc but im going to attach the negative label of aggression to it so now shut up the term microaggression is an perverse abuse of language which is designed specifically to stifle contributions to debate
we know that blacks are not more stupid but thanks for the slur anyway that there are specific problems for us blacks at least that are not due to external factors like prejudice is demonstrable black immigrants to the us from africa or from the former british islands in the caribbean do much better in school and work than the black americans uk indian immigrants do much better than the pakistanis and bangladeshis if you want to argue that its all because of other people please do to me it seems that the problem is basically one of culture uk white working classes used to be fairly class conscious and getting an education was seen as trying to change social classes american blacks are reported to criticise good students as trying to be or act white sowell wrote a book on this tracing the attitude to the white indentured englishmen the slaves basically supplemented then replaced in effect an early version of the supposed attitude of workers in the ussr they pretend to pay us we pretend to work transporting poor englishmen was the original method of providing labour to the american colonies it didnt work very well in the south because of malaria
so you would be ok to be the subject of targeted humiliation in public on the basis of your accentskin colour for example because the guy doing it has a right if youre going with extremes presumably you would be happy for someone else to decide that your speechcomments should be censored based on their views of you or your views this is the issue of deciding that there are limits what if the person deciding has limits you disagree with personally im ok with allow people to say what they want unless there would be active harm as in the fire in a theatre example incitement to hatred is censored but saying hateful things is not
i think the media needs to evaluate itself and have some honor the way the media covers trump completletey unfairly and dishonestly is totally shameless hopefully they will realise that to offend the leader of our country and the leader of our people just for the sake of it or just to profit from it is wrong trump deserves better treatment at least honest treatment
does this standard apply to louis farrakhan or maxine waters or rosie odonnell just checking
another issue i forgot to add in my earlier post is that of equal application what a lot of people who argue what youre arguing seem to see as implicit is that political correctness for lack of a better term doesnt need to be applied equally take religion for example you can practically rank religions by the level of sensitivity that people are willing to treat them with islam almost always comes first normally followed by hinduism sikhism judaism and protestantism with catholicism in last place its why catholics are mocked for getting upset over tv shows like pope town yet the bbc wouldnt even show the danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad on the news from a progressive perspective islam is a religion of peace and catholicism is a source of backwardness but this all hinges on the fact that most uk catholics are white and most uk muslims are not which makes no sense as a basis for privileging the second most powerful ideological institution on the planet over the first
yes ive repeated it because you keep avoiding the point and your distinction is artificial if the argument as to harm is designed to facilitate calls to restrict speech then it is disingenuous to claim youre not implying that its inherent to the argument there is of course substance to your argument that its designed this way it just appears a convenient means by which you peg the mere argument as to harm as being something that is restrictive of speech without the need to engage with whether or not harm is caused as an approach its little different to what you purport to criticise
indeed thank goodness for female intuition
some white men are privileged many arent seems pretty obvious to me intersectionalism does not see individuals every person is judged by the group they were born into this is so they can discriminatebully people via their grouping with reference to where that group ranks in oppression hierarchy
men are still privileged in our patriarchal society
the guardian only allowing one upvote is a microaggression
the worst aspect of this sort of thinking is that when you take it to its natural conclusion the only possible outcome is you need to create a morality police like the taliban or the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice and we know how well that works as francine said in her famous song httpsyoutubelynyjnozdqg 
thats not really the case is it the bulk of the criticism of those like hopkins or milo is not i disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it its much more youre causing anger and hurt you shouldnt be allowed to do that you should be silenced there is a misconception here that not giving someone a platform is silencing them it isnt it is no more silencing katy hopkins to say she isnt allowed to speak at a university than turning off the  oclock news is me silencing huw edwards it is an idea that lacks any credible intellectual backing the intellectual incoherence on the right is just getting worse and worse it is almost infantile now
so jews were killed by the nazis because they opposed the regime all the stalinist purges genuinely punishing disloyalty were they hannah ardent quite rightly points out that its actually the opposite totalitarian regimes deliberately target the innocent not the guilty actually sd and gestapo reports show that they were remarkably relaxed about private opposition to the party if they recieved a report that a neighbour made a rude joke about hitler theyd literally say who cares my son was reading marx the other day theyd sayteenagers ey

the word is affect if youre using impact as a verb
i wonder why its taken so long
casting all critics as authoritarian and censorious artificially polarises the debate where as casting everyone who dares to disagree with the liberal narrative questions it or votes the wrong way as anything between a knuckle dragging neanderthal oaf right the way through to a rabid nazi fascist does nothing to polarize the debate whatsoever you want to know why theres a backlash against political correctness its because of the nauseating hypocrisy of these self appointed masters of the universe who seem to think that they are the moral amp intellectual superiors of the human race
so what valid reasons are there for opposing political correctness ive seen many reasons put forward all of them turned out to be bollocks you need to define what you are referring to with political correctness heres some pc ideas which should be validly opposedthe idea that all white people are racistracism is what white people do to nonwhitesthe idea that sexism is similarly narrowly defined as maleonfemale any idea of large group membership conferring privilege or worse guilt see the male gaze male privilege or white privilege they form the basis of where pc and identity politics adherents in general have gone wrong over the last couple of decades none of which means that the original idea pf pc was bad or even the laws which were implemented are or were sadly ideologues and zealots got hold of them and liked the power they conferred victim status became an industry to be jealously guarded people being offended on behalf of others and especially the apparent ability to abuse others with impunity on the back of that if they were not in a protected group said groups being a major failure of equality law even if none of that fits the bill just look at the hatred and abuse you can see from liberals on here directed at tories white males and most recently brexshitters its pc culture which has morphed to enable people to think that they are entitled to openly abuse groups of people they think deserve it as long as they are the right ones that is not making the world a better place is it
i would say it is equally naive to always stand by your beliefs  no idea is  perfect which is why i draw the line at inciting violence when it comes to free speech id also try and not invoke hitler when making an arguement godwins law can cause people to disregard it even if it is a good arguement
liking the irony or did you intentionally use a generalisation anyway breivik was just a deranged man protests from the left result in hooliganism at the very least equal to football hooligans however its usually arson and criminal damage tony blair the epitome of the left invasion orders resulted in hundreds of thousands of innocent iraqis dying get connected

i dont know that a successful strategy against outragefeeders is to give them exposure and an audience that seems extremely counterproductive to me especially since responding to rightwing hatemongers with rational arguments doesnt appear to have a very good track record of stopping them from achieving success if it took place in some sort of heavily moderated debate context where questiondodging whataboutery fallacious logic ad hominem etc was banned then i might see the virtue but as it stands all of those can be used quite effectively by rightwing hatemongers to deflect all rational criticisms and come off as victors trump in the republican primary debate or the presidential debate not ideal joseph mccarthy under the gavel in the armymccarthy hearings thats more like it you need a context where lies are called to account and i dont believe the events you describe provide such a context
worth noting that your example would be governed by entirely different laws surrounding threatening behaviour stalking etc true as it should be just clarifying my position in far too roundabout a way i guess the point of disagreement that wont be shifting here is whether or not sentence a should be punishable in and of itself
in america anyone can become president thats the problem
one where liberals got a leftist fired matt bruenig a writer was fired for being rude to neera tanden a powerful clinton ally on twitter for a career ending witch hunt over some remarks theres the tim hunt story though you do no doubt you find these unimpressive and might even think the repercussions these people suffered for their remarks are warranted they do demonstrate my point nongovernmental actors very much have the power and exercise it to seriously harm people for speech they dont like
political correctness doesnt change peoples minds or attitudes it simplysuppresses them and this stops them ever being open to discussion and challenge this leads to a society consisting of multiple pc distortions for example why should multiculturalism be elevated beyond criticism so that the risk of being accused of racism arises should multiculturalism become critiqued its nonsense isnt it please look at the article in todays guardian concerning use of the word liberation this is pc oversensitivity in the extreme isnt it reasonably clear that bj could only mean freedom from brussels bureaucracy and autocracy thus does pc condemn society to become too afraid to discover the truth by the free exchange and collision of adverse opinion in reasoned debate the assertive politics of identity and group rights deserves no elevated status placing them beyond discussion or question everything should be open for criticism and analysis under conditions of reasoned debate on conceptually equal terms
what was it you were saying earlier about little man syndrome was that accusation knowing selfmockery on your part or do you genuinely not see the irony
i think that nowadays certain types wear being offended like a badge of honour and seek offence out certain types will be offended about almost anything so being offensive can be entirely unintended
nice deflection and redirection but wheres your citation maybe i should express it in a dr seuss verse
thanks jim appleby especially for that last point
not to mention the fact that microaggressions are  subjective and frankly impossible to define or rule against
can you think of an example of equivalent words for which the male version became pejorative whilst the female version remained complementary that is the point of this article
repeated requests from the readership for more quality control over content are being continually refused thus readers are letting their frustrations get the better of them not exactly the right thing to do but understandable in some circumstances
humans are notoriously myopic its quite difficult for most to truly see beyond their one singular life looking at the bigger picture can be uncomfortable at the very least one of your sentences points towards this the process of pejoration may take place below the level of consciousness but in historical perspective the direction of travel is obvious and this statement is beautiful and oh so true language as the medium through which we conduct almost all relationships public and private bears the precise imprint of our cultural attitudes the history of language then is like a fossil record of how those attitudes have evolved or how stubbornly they have stayed the same  thanks david for this article
there was a girls boarding school in melbourne that was emptied of its rightful residents to accommodate american servicemen during ww legend had it that in the dormitories were bellpushes with the words ring for a mistress the bells were quickly disconnectedi wonder what current words will have a changed meaning in  years time already i can remember chucking yonnies as a kid if you hit the tin it was bonzer we dont hear these words and many others today ah well thats progress
i thought of a weasel
lol would you adam and eve it
hussy is a contraction of thcentury husewif a word cognate with modern housewife no its the same word split into two pronunciation and meanings only use cognate with between languages where the depth of the split is greater to make your point about the sexism of english you need to survey all the terms for women in the language see what percentage of them decline in dignity over time then repeat the process for all terms for men your eight samples dont really prove anything because it is a common fate for a word to become more specialised andor decline in digniy over time
you effectively prove your own point only the opinions of women count these days and any opinion expressed by men is either misogyny or the subject of some snickering peabrained response copied straight from the radfem handbook it would be funny were it not so entirely predictable and pathetically tragic
you too ignore the words where there is no justification whatsoever angel divine intuition conman pimps and madams do the same job but pimp is a far more insulting term men are said to ponce off women when they contribute nothing to the household income yet women are homemakers when they live off the earnings of their husbands the stats argument doesnt stack up there are far more female teachers than male teachers but the term is not gender loaded for example my point is that the words paedophile and paedo will be applied as an insult to men who are not sexually attracted to children but will not be applied as an insult to women far more innocent male teachers are falsely accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour than female teachers as a result of this gendering of the crime
except that they dont do that any more its a bit oldfashioned as in about a hundred years oldfashioned and anyone dense enough to not to have grasped that really needs to consider whether they are safe to travel without a career
do you mean pop out pop off in relation to your oldpop makes you sound like a euthanasia enthusiast not that theres anything wrong with that of course
nothing to do with sexism more to do with the roles that god intended when he created man

veryfy
wouldnt a man who spins yarn be referred to as a spinner see brewerbrewster bakerbaxter
hussy courtesan wench art thou kidding me who the hell uses those archaic terms any more
can you provide some examples of words that have become pejorative for men while the female equivalent has remained of high standing i can think perhaps of queen but then its hardly a massive putdown when applied to men i cant think of others but you say there are so many more id be interested to know what they are
i think the term spanish practices has pretty much fallen from english usage starting about  to  years ago for obvious reasons
why is it ok to call a man an oaf how offensive have you never heard of margaret thatcher we have moved on my dear women are allowed into political parties these days and sometimes they are allowed to do more than make the tea wash up and polish the podiums
what about chatte or langue or caresse or bise
no dogs are commonly associated with rabies theres even one in to kill a mockingbird 
pimp is male sure but then youve missed the point of the article its not as if theres a female equivalent of high standing eg the article compared madam a female pimp with sir its not like theres a pimpess which is some kind of royal title but even in your own argument the cases you bring up are hardly unexpected paedophiles about  of cases are thought to be perpetrated by women who rarely act without a man involved google professor kevin brownes work among many others rapists stranger attacks by women on adults or children are almost unknown for other forms of rape by female perpetrators its hard to find data but the numbers are reported to be tiny compared to rape by male perpetrators there is a fairly valid reason for all the terms you have mentioned maybe not thief but then i dont think man when you say thief to follow your theme words like passenger are non gender loaded because a passenger could easily be either sex construction worker is loaded as a male term because just like rapists you encounter male construction workers far more often than female i could go on but you can do the research yourself
because all the other parties were made up of men you oaf when the playing field is not level you need to redress the balance for a while look up priviledge and learn some stuff for a while
the author missed a few what about hysterical or debauched or wittering or tiresome or frigid or brainless or good time
i always thought dutch courage referred to a fortifying swig of gin a spirit which is meant to originate from the netherlands
that assumes that sexism is wrong why is it that only men are sexist why is it ok to form the womens party but not to form a mens party
the word potato is racist against potatoes
are pedants male or female both it seems

this article which is at the very least thoughtprovoking appears to be stirring up a lot of angry kneejerk responses from men wonder why that is 
i thought the person who started the hue and cry was a phd student i dont think that makes him an academic
i think by asking somebody what he means when he uses the word holistic you are unfairly asking him to be too specific surely by electing to use the word holistic his intention is that the whole language indeed the sum total of all languages past present and future be implied and inferred simultaneously therefore viewed holistically the word holistic means everything from a to zythum nest pas
matthewh re  all about how the dictionary is sexist  how would you know it appears you didnt read it it plainly says  in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world 
this garbage article started off with pop i immediately thought of my old dad not listed next a pop off it is all in the mind
oh and i would like to be thought of as a rational mansplainer not a rabid mansplainer because calm down and hear me out would you im simply trying to rationally and calmly explain things without all the shrill hysterics its just a straightforward matter of putting logical steps one after the other without letting emotions get in the way cant you understand that
sexism has existed does exist and in all probability will continue to exist the language will reflect that its the condition not the language that is at fault
dear oh dear this article another one by emer otoole and valenti shoehorns it into an article about donald trump and megyn kelly too all about how the dictionary is sexist truly incredible this publication really is scraping the barrel aaanndd watch this comment disappear
very sexist what is better a brothel madam or a male pimp why do female teachers seduce male students but male teachers rape consenting female students look at how women wear make up and breast enhancers what are they if not con artists they are certainly misleading their male admirers arent they why dont you address angel divine pure and virtuous
its getting there
outside of downton abbey nobody uses those words seriously any longer with the possible exception of mistress in short this article is a pointless exercise we could just as easily examine words that were demeaning to men such as churl from ceorl the inner guard of king harald villain from villein dwellers about a villa and so forth
ill just go with my ladies of the evening thank you do your ladies thank you though for the name you give them what do they call themselves
oh dear think for a moment about the denigration of half of the population denigration has pejorated from a word meaning blackening to a word meaning insulting the english language often equates blackness with badness and dont get me started on oldelderseniorcroneaging
i am sure just think if we hadnt invented alphabetic literacy we would have had the same holistic thinking as the rest of the animal kingdom instead of writing his book leonard shlain would have been shitting in the woods and sniffing the anuses of every other humanoid who walked past
considering the cultural climate while the language was initially developing im surprised there arent more build a bridge and get over it by the way
people are free to challenge what they want but it would be craven and dishonest for oxford to change the meaning of words from what they are to what some people think they ought to be by the way why would one want to use a such an edited dictionary anyway one might want to know if a word had a derogatory connotation when associated with women this way one could avoid inadvertently using it in the wrong context
i like billy bragg but do not like his voice because it grates on mei have said this many timesdoes this mean i am a sexist pig
perhaps long words such as nothing count as two for daoudmac
im under  and have had hussy madam spinster wench and tart tossed at me not in any kind sense over the years theres probably a reason you dont see a lot of sexist language but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist and claiming that your lack of experience of it is proof that its not an issue is akin to claiming that the fact you can see the horizon is proof the earth is flat
and i suppose next week we get an article about certain words that make the english language racistwords like honky whiteyevery language contains words that will upset some of the people it really is time we grow up and except that the world is not a perfect place and that there are some people who will put certain inflections on words and certain people who will take offense at the smallest thing
do dictionaries riddle i thought they sought to clarify and define
very true whereas the word queen used to refer only to females
theres another one slob is a word associated particularly with men this article is completely one sided sexist and fails to even recognise that the gender distribution of words is pretty even
nor evidently do you
the irony is that english is probably the least sexist language in the world compared with languages such as frenchwhere for some bizarre reason cheese is masculine and windows are feminine
man this website is utter trash
pimps con artists rapists etc are more likely to be male whereas the article gives examples of equivalent words for which the male version maintained its prestige and honour whilst the female version became a pejorative
i never have battles of wits with the unarmed like you
i know this isnt connected but well done you managed to get in my pet most hated buzz word of the momentholisticused by hr and people in educationpublic service and governments around the world for no other reason than it sounds like you are ahead of the curve and care when in fact you change no behaviour whatsoever i am yet to get a good answer when you say to someone what do you actually mean by that when they have used the word often they reply with another buzz phrase like i mean take in the whole picture
josephine leigh re  i was beginning to think only male thinking was being represented here  this article really seems to have brought the guys out of the woodwork hasnt it you may want to check out another post i just recently put up about the book the alphabet vs the goddess
theres no such thing as a witch or a wizard the word for a female dog is bitch theres nothing sexist about that word when applied to a female dog you will find that the word dog is used as a term of abuse when applied to men a dog of the house of capulet moves me being an example along with filthy dog dogs of war and dog breathed the word spinster is very rarely used these days so ing it here is disingenuous it is true that men look up to studs and women look down on sluts but most men would rather be in the company of a slut than a stud just as most women would rather be in the company of a stud than a slut you pays your money and makes your choice
pairing rabid with feminist isnt demeaning toward half the population it is demeaning toward those particular feminists who could be described figuratively as rabid yes they exist and they dont do the overall cause of feminism any favours
bastard used to refer to either sex
saying feminist is like opening a portal to the dimension of angry neckbearded fedora wearing mens rights activists theres only one way to combat this threat ego stroking repeat after me yes youre right no its all the fault of those nasty feminists of course youre being persecuted by not having everyone listen to what you say and agree with you on every point
um that is four
yeah how sexist that shrill that refers to highpitched sounds is applied to womens voices more than mens obviously there is nooooooooooooo possible reason for this except for misogyny rack your brains for hours and youll never come up with any other conceivable reason
 why on earth would you think it insults the woman more than the man actually bastard used to be the polite word whoreson was the insult and that wasis sexist only because more men than women have to pay for sex come to think of it that means that whoreson would demean the man more than the woman however whore is also the appropriate term for male prostitutes both carnal and intellectual god i love the english language wheels within wheels
 famous words making an iconic sentence summing up the virtue gag inducing rabid feminists much ado about nothing
surely absolute bollocks is sexist and implies that nonsense is manufactured in the testicles why dont we say say absolute mammaries or total clits
i use the expression our wench in a positive way the term bint is otherwise
ps to my previous post amoeba being a living thing but not having two distinct and separate sexual forms would be considered to have a common gender
perhaps its their cats fault see other article for explanation
continuing the theme below what about paedophile a word associated almost always with males despite the existence of women who seduce and sexually abuse children what about pimp or ponce then there is conman how about rapist use that word and what gender springs to mind thief burglar bully test those on  random people and ask them to link to gender and the vast majority will say male how about intuition why is that a preserve of women angel in the bible they are men but in common parlance the angelic are almost always female divine more often than not female pure virtuous i could go on basically the article selects a few words to make a specious case im just amazed given it is so shallow that it was written by a man
i find this somewhat unconvincing it clearly states how the use of certain examples to explain words and the degradation of said words over the years all lead to one point sexism which in this case the article proves by providing examples of strong examples of definitions that have become offensive over the years many many definitions have changed to more negative terms over the years not just gender based definitions this is a phenomena across the language as a whole not just targeted at women if you notice too as words have became negative for women so much more words have developed against men which was not pointed out instead the whole argument was based on one gender specific path and not enough compelling diverse evidences
yes oxford dictionaries should come under fire mainly for being riddling with factual logical and grammatical errors and generally poor definitions that again and again illustrate its largely undeserved reputation upon which this author draws to grab attention the only thing going for it these days is that its cute convenient little app in mac os

governess is still used todayheres a random ad from wwwexpatruvacanciesphp urgently a russian vip family is looking for a french governess to tutor french and develop cultural outlook of  girls aged    and  years this is a highly recommended position by our agency with a stable high salary luxury accommodation and vacation sponsored by the employer the girls studied french previously with a native french teacher as well as other foreign languages which they study with several governesses
well said i was beginning to think only male thinking was being represented here i agree with you and no doubt we will be regarded with derision on the matter being a female in a patriarchal world is tough speaking out about it is even tougher
true i think both those terms have understandably been gradually falling into disuse as the proportions of nurses who are male and of doctors who are female have been climbing up from first minute fractions of one percent up to small numbers of whole percentage points and now getting into the decades of percents
tart seems to be used fairly often between gays but usually lightheartedly
an excellent article totally bitchin
oh dear a negative term of hopeless acceptance based on dear amongst other uses a derogatory term for a female
her itage
ok you are clearly pissed off and i wont disagree with you that things are a long way short of perfect however to a impugn my honesty and b assume that equality in law is unimportant are not things im prepared to let past so sure youll never know if my wife ever actually said them youll just have to take my word for it but why then if my word is so obviously suspect to you should i take your word for anything and as for equality in law well it exists that it isnt always perfectly applied well what law is and as for the majority of women do not earn nearly as much as men well that is just a canard that is repeated enough to make it appear true but only when the words for doing the same work and for the same length of time are conveniently omitted if you genuinely know of a case where a woman doing the same work as a man for the same length of time is being paid less then you need to advise her to take her case to an employment tribunal and she will win finally it might have been interesting if you had bothered to engage with my actual criticism of the article the implication that as language reflects social condition and the terms used for women have suffered perforation ergo womens condition must be worse now that when these terms were equivalent with their male equivalents being clearly false do you honestly believe that thth century england was a more equitable society for women if so i believe you might have some genuine problems with basic historical understanding clearly the present day is far better for women than  years ago can you agree with me on that or will that simple statement stimulate a further irrelevant rant
i dont have a view on the quilliam foundation as a fervent but liberal antitheist im not particularly excited by an organisation that seeks to make a religion attractive but i do uphold its right to do so and to exercise free speech as much as maryam namazie should have
with all thats going on in the world right now you print this theres plenty of maleonly derisiveness in the dictionary if you care to look cuckoldpansyapefagfairybeefcakeperv and of course wanker
i dont really understand what youre saying does janitor come with power more power than secretary i only picture a man first as a jockey because most jockeys are men boardmember doesnt make me picture a man quite so much but why not just the curse of violence and do you consider male highway maintenance silly why do we never hear it
gt whereas in english there is that awful expression male nurse gt as if a nurse should be female by defaultgtsurely it has some connection in the mammalian context to the female gender
sexism against females imo
its a bit shaky if you have to go on what you think hes implying and even then acknowledge he isnt implying abolition keep up thalia i never suggested he was implying abolition in saying possibly not abolition i was merely referring back to your dialogue with another posted which i was joining in with and yes i do think hes implying theres a problem with derogatory words id even agree to that fairly anodyne proposition though probably not about what the problems are and almost certainly not about what if anything to do about them
you havent heard jasper carrots wanker song then
when i hear the word nagging i think of some male slob who cant be arsed to do what is reasonably expected from him and forces some putupon woman to repeat the bleedin obvious endlessly in order to keep the household functioning properly
collins dictionary says that this is a thcentury contraction of sweetheart a term of endearment particularly to women which just shows the danger in using collins as an authority
when i read this i clearly failed mr shariatmadaris test when i saw rabid the first words i thought of was dog closely followed by animal then hydrophobia i then thought of the david croneberg film and that lead me to its star marilyn chambers which then made me think of pornographic films
oldskal re women are no longer chattels have equal rights in law which was not the case in shakespearechaucers time can own property vote the same as men etc etc  aaaaah women have equal rights in law looks pretty on paper doesnt it then why is it the majority of women do not earn nearly as much money as men why do priests reverends etc still marry people as man and wife why is it women are routinely murdered or bludgeoned by their supposed loved ones here in our seemingly advanced society and their rights to make decisions regarding their bodies are continually and systematically threatened by men in power its interesting that you resort to using words you attribute to the woman to whom youre married as though speaking for her when in fact youre using those words well never know if she actually said them to shore up your argument
you are both nuts
you think hatred of women is endemic in our society
of course oed responded in the classically bad way first of all they bothered to respond and then they apologised the twatterati now spell blood and will demand a human sacrifice i wish more people would figure this out
of course you are right total we havent moved in fact we might as well ban women from higher education remove the womens vote repeal the married womens property act and consign all women barefoot to the kitchen because things basically havent moved and everything apparently achieved so far doesnt really amount to much
the  examples of sexist linguistic denigration shariatmadari gives many are well down that route to the lexicon dustbin of history what has grown exponentially is regular use is dickhead knobhead bellend legend tool prick wanker jerk and so on so im looking forward to shariatmadaris companion article on the sexist linguistic denigration of men next week yea right
i would add the false generics man and men they are not true generics as used in the phrase when man walked on the moon because you cannot use them in situations that involve only female humans giraffes gestate their young for  months is perfectly intelligible but not men gestate their young for  months likewise we dont roll about the floor laughing at gorillas nurse their babies for months but try this men nurse their babies for durations of a few days to several years pregnancy in man lasts for  months the same as pregnancy in cattle sounds weird right man and men are false generics oh and that man who was pregnant and gave birth still genetically female still possessed a functional uterus
on the plus side we dont have many gendered words in english
i would wager that the word madam is used far more often as a courtesy than to describe someone running a brothel as for bachelor conferring high status i just dont see that at all
apologist claptrap full of weasel words every single one
im sure their are as many or more examples of words for men that have become derogatory why are you sure can you name one start by thinking of derogative words for man or for masculine roles other than terms of abuse derived from body parts can you think of any if so did any of them start off as something other than derogatory i really think youll struggle
from the th century onwards it was used to mean a woman other than his wife with whom a man has a longlasting sexual relationship or earlier mistress n look up mistress at dictionarycom early c female teacher governess from old french maistresse mistress lover housekeeper governess female teacher modern french maîtresse fem of maistre master see master n sense of a woman who employs others or has authority over servants is from early c sense of kept woman of a married man is from early c etymonline
i wonder why it is that the word cuckold only applies to a man and implies a person who is rightly subjected to ridicule whereas the equivalent for a wife is a wronged woman
hahahaha
what about bad  middle english badde perhaps akin to old english bæddel hermaphrodite bædling womanish man from dictionarycom girl also used to be an gender unspecific word for any young person but now female or pejorative if directed at males sissy is an americanism stemming from sister but women are hardly the only victims of english knave is a good illustration of classism in english before  middle english old english cnafa cognate with german knabe boy akin to old norse knapi page boy from dictionarycom so is villain  middle english vilein vilain lt middle french lt late latin villānus a farm servant from dictionarycom
having a womb does not make a person incapable of running a company or being the boss or running the line at a premiership football game we should only care about gender differences when they are relevant and not as the pcgonemad crew would like to assign all sorts of things to gender very much agreed equality of opportunity not enforced equality and an end to form over function
i can almost feel the desperation of the author here as he searches the dictionary for hours on end for proof of the terrible sexism of the english language madam seriously how about pimp as for courtesan who uses this nowadays other than in a historical context as for wench or tart there are equally allmale terms like dog or perv or bastard
the changing usage and meaning of the word gay suggests you are wrong
yeah but you have honigkuchenpferd which cancels out all swearwords 
if the pc brigade now theres a word laced with meaning chucked out all the terms it did not like our rich language would sound like jargon or worse still baby talk some of the words the writer defines as at the heart of the english language as usual do some english bashing are also common to french and have equivalents in german and dutch

theres no argument in the article just pseudoargument and nonsequiturs welcome to the guardian
a little racism is natural due to tribalism and a fear of the unknown familiarity breeds contempt
policing by whom the feminists or the antifeminists who seek to undermine feminism by associating it with pejorative adjectives such as rabid i think that policing can happen in both directions and that we be aware of this when discussing issues i agree that labelling a person as bad is not conducive to a reasonable discussion so i would ask you to consider why it is so common to find certain feminists throwing around the labels of misogynistsexist when they find people disagreeing with them there is also the issue that feminism is not a singular ideologyposition and that to argue against parts of it is not the same as being against equality as most people understand it i think the great majority of this policing you speak of is done by the latter group and this is where the usage comes from i think that would depend on where you are looking consider the example of universitiescolleges in the us there is a lot of effort put in by certain groups to create safe spaces but that usually translates into them not wanting other people to express opinions that they do not agree with christina hoff sommers for example then there is the differing reactions to the ban bossy campaign and the words that should be banned times  the internet voted feminist onto the list and quite quickly it was removed due to complaints
where did i say i didnt like this paper or that i wasnt interested in the piece in question au contraire the thinking behind this kind of egregious nonsense is of great interest one doesnt have to like a newspaper or a writer to be interested in what they have to say
my wife has been on at me about a nagging headache
you could be right what is an alternative explanation
and can you explain when it was a normal descriptor for a man ah theres wanker jones vs ah theres madam jones its an insult but has always been rather than losing its original meaning and becoming an insult because it is associated with men ie madams transference to mean brothel manager
my grandmother was a shop manageress im surprised if you have never heard that word before its not that uncommon though it is chiefly a british term
not a euphemism but a substitute referring to something that i hear does exist
the geordie term for a woman is a wife and for a wife its our lass probably wouldnt get away that sort of thing at the graun
i dont really understand why there is resistance to the premise of this article in some of the comments if noam chomsky is right in saying that language is the core property that defines human beings then looking at prejudiced values encoded in it is pretty important yes some of the terms are historical but that provides the context for examining attitudes today and if feminist follows rabid as a contemporary example of collocation then it show how far we havent moved it should be a problem for all of us that mysogyny is still so endemic
dutch courage is not an insult to the dutch but refers to english mariners needing a few drinks before daring the walk across the wooded dunes from den haag to scheveningen where robbers lay in wait
the sexual connotations of dick have long since been overtaken by its secondlevel metaphorical and pejorative use to mean a male idiot it might have got there via penis but evolution in language means its moved on
yes but leftwingers believe that if we stop using a particular word or if we change the word into another one then the item will disappear or become something else probably empowered it doesnt work like that im afraid if one colourful word colocation or phrase becomes proscribed by the thought police then im sure that there are plenty of creative people out there who will apply new terms to describe what still exists as a reality for them leftwingers too are quite happy to apply negative words and phrases to others who dont think like them as well the word bigot immediately comes to mind
this is no place for logic or reason lets get offended
then youd be able to give us some examples
here he is defending an islamic organisation of successful opponents of free speechhttpwwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreeoctuniversityofwarwickmaryamnamazieactivist and here he is attempting rightly or wrongly i dont know to discredit a founder of the quilliam foundationhttpwwwtheguardiancompoliticsaugmaajidnawazhowaformerislamistbecamedavidcameronsantiextremismadviser it seems to me contra mboy that theres a direct continuity between his support for censorship by bullying in religious debate and his similar stance in lexicographical debate im a little baffled as to his motivation mind you
very musical
since the thoughts expressed by the words will continue to exist whats the point
an old fashioned and not particularly wellused term in newcastle but yeah i have heard it
only hussy wench and tart show contempt for women the other five seem to be a description of what a woman does it seems you dont like the english why would you bring up such words of contempt in a world where women were held as inferior until the middle of the last century and are now slowly gaining the respect they deserve would you like to try this analysis with the languages of the arab asian and african world to see what turns up 
and how many days later were they
youd be happy with a spinster of science degree then would you i wouldnt be unhappy i wouldnt go as far as saying id be happy as it is a matter of complete indifference to me
its also how confirmation bias works  excellent point
of course not it does happen now and again its the grauns way of saying yes this was total horseshit we do apologize
sexism  prejudice or discrimination based on sex especially discrimination against women  behavior conditions or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex discriminate  recognize a distinction differentiate  make an unjust or prejudicial distinction in the treatment of different categories of people especially on the grounds of race sex or age men and women are different and therefore one can discriminate against sex you cant discriminate one apple from the next as both apples are the same you can discriminate definition  chose by recognize a distinction from oranges if you want to make apple crumble discrimination in option  includes the term unjust morals and ethics are by culture and ideology your ideology entails no mention of sexual differences in order to achieve your utopian ideas of sex gender equality of opportunity fortunately for me and unfortunately for you most people acknowledge that men and women are physically and emotionally different and thats reflected in our attitudes within society including words
switch the pronouns in your post amp you sound like a massive bigot true observed vs made up by men to denigrate women both unsubstantiated rubbish congratulations on having the most deluded self serving comment on a guardian article that takes some doing
thats because they are acting like a big girls blouse no further questions your honour
and aptly do try again
since youve taken the trouble to read and comment on a piece youre not interested in in a newspaper you dont like perhaps its you who needs to find something more useful to do with your time
also bachelor means a university graduate another positive connotation
i hope you will not object if i offer my most enthusiastic contrafibularities
indeed lol
not because
think about what word you use for the female equivalent of bachelor for eg i use the same word regardless of gender unmarried but while were on the subject of language eg is the abbreviation of the latin exempli gratia which means for the sake of example so you have written for for the sake of example youre welcome
its not all good for male terms sire used to refer to men of high status but now is used almost exclusively of horses lord has gone in the uk from meaning ruler or god to being a political appointee who was typically a failure as an elected politician mister as a form of address is rarely a compliment hey mister etc and im not sure how often sir would be used nonironically these days guvnor is at best a foreman boy is used as a condescending term for black people and to indicate a young dumb gay sex object often spelt boi
rabid first word in my head was dog or fox raccoon etc grating and shrill are descriptions on how certain womens voices sound but not just women the other week i watched a football match and the male commentator had a very gratingly annoying scottish accent i bitched about it all game mostly however these words are more applicable to how womens voices sound crusty old bachelors are laughed and sneered as much as old spinsters otherwise meh
that is only one example in the other direction i doubt there are many if any more
rabid
youd be happy with a spinster of science degree then would you
if i were to say these words what would spring to mind sugar daddywife beaterhomeless manplay boyrent boyslugs snails and puppy dog tails likewise there are sexual terms applied to men abusively that are not applied to women quite often they involve homosexuality or other types of sexual activity cocksuckermotherfuckersheep shaggerqueen also words have very different meanings if used on men or women cute and sweet generally means nice person but you wouldnt want to sleep with when applied to a man however they are used positively when applied to women beautiful feminizes a man handsome masculates a woman we could go on for days like this if there is a way to abuse something men and women will have found ways to do it on a stereotypcal level womens insults for men tend to be more subtle and insidious as women have a better faculty for language and are more creative as a result mens insults for women are cruder unconsidered and formulaic
mainly because the amount of organisation required is beyond most undergraduates
rabid gt dog woof
creep a male of low social economic aesthetic status who attempts to engage in conservationinteraction with a female who perceives herself to be of a higher social economic aesthetic status widely used to dismiss amp ruin decent men midwife etc plenty of examples of anti male sexism too
im afraid you may have been i dont actually think this is the worst offender but often the headlines do a real disservice to the articles here
not often enough i sometimes think
perjoration isnt in the dictionary but pejoration is httpwwwoxforddictionariescomusdefinitionamerican_englishpejoration
despite what the comments below seem to say i actually thought the article was good it did make me think that the female equivalents have over time tend to become a away refer to women in a sexual role or lower domestic rather than a powerful or respected one we dont call women madam now if they are an authority figure police army instead they are called mam i have always noted that a single male is called bachelor which sounds like a young attractive up and coming man where as a single woman is spinster and has a too old over the hill connotation so have never used it
or because when trying to correct two hundred thousand years of one half the human race screwing over the other half for no reason other than that it can dont you mean two hundred thousand years of one percent of the human race screwing over the other  for no reason other than that it can
a language is a reflection of the level of development in a society a very good one
really are you acquainted with the urban dictionary
the trouble is a language is a method for people to communicate and express their thoughts there has to be a sufficient number of words for people to do this for it to be of any use as a form of communication which will inevitably mean that there will be a few words that some people dont like i just dont understand what this article is for by what process does david shariatmadari suggest that we in future police that naughty english language to stop it being so sexist this just seems like a tedious point scoring little article that says very little of use yes there are words that offend in the english language but its use as a language for communication would be massively devalued if it was not a language that had a sufficiently large number of words for people to express their every thought
find some then find the ones that reflect what has been described in this article
i was taking the piss but realise thats not always immediately obvious here at the graun
i am sure this is truei would expect someone who studies a subject to see more than the casual observer that is how academics work its also how confirmation bias works
none of those really fit the bill in the context of this article though did you read the article did you look up those words to make sure youre right
is gerwoman worse wrong should be gerperson
you know i think you are right the headline eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language completely misses the point then have i been clickbaited
fortunately the language will take care of itself and usage will evolve but if you start wittering on about perjoration a word that isnt in the oed with respect to words that belittle women remember that its a game that can be played both ways when did you last hear a woman being described as a bastard
what about motherfucker
alternately english could also be described as the least sexist language in the world as a doctor is a doctor regardless of gender same with citizen driver voter and a thousand other examples that all take feminine forms in german and other languages
lol youve used the existence of the phrase jobs for the boys to argue sexist bias against men ok m
hes got  now heres an article from the very pages demonstrating exactly what mboy is talking about httpwwwtheguardiancompoliticsaugmaajidnawazhowaformerislamistbecamedavidcameronsantiextremismadviser there are others but im sure you can look for them google is your friend
but she still wasnt suggesting anything as fatuous as you are accusing her of i think it was difficult to perceive through the fog of fauxwittgensteinianism that she was suggesting that changing the rules for use of language allowed one to change the society that used the language that and she didnt know what dictionary she was talking about
sexism is sensible fair and respectful of course as are guns organised privilege and corruption
only a custard and jam based dessert would write that
not sure if its feminist but it sounds kinda hot what color is the corset cuticle gnawing
where are you getting the by order of the male dominated class thing from i cant find any reference to that in the article you dont seem to realise that your post is in agreement with the article
language is shaped by social use and we can show language is sexist think about what word you use for the female equivalent of bachelor for eg and think about the networks of connotation the words have whatever your views about feminism maybe relax and realise that raising awareness of embedded biases in language and culture helps gently nudge away from those biases and surely thats not such a terrible thing and you dont need to have a hissyfit men are still in charge of all the things and fucking them up nicely
comments on this piece will be closing shortly many thanks for your contributions
yes they are homophones that was my point your phrase they are still phonetic doesnt really mean anything in that context aallargando has already replied to admit that you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled was badly phrased it is simply not true as it stands otherwise those words would not be homophonesthe point is that if you are familiar with the quirks of french spelling you can usually tell from the spelling how a word should be pronounced there are plenty of exceptions though which is not the case with english the other way round ie trying to arrive at the spelling from the pronunciation is difficult in both languages but i would put my money on french being worse here because there are so many places where letters are not reflected in the pronunciation giving rise to a lot of homophones it is not without reason that le petit robert gives homophones at the bottom of entries so you can check whether perhaps you in fact wanted the meaning of another word
yep latinx looks and sounds completely alien to native spanishspeakers i have occasionally seen them use latin which is sort of clever but still jarring to see and impossible to pronounce
will it make the language easier to learn if so yes please
plenty of languages including english turkish or thai get along perfectly well without them lowest common denominator and the french have done radical things with language before such as scrapping the names of days of the week during the revolution doubleplusnogood this was a straight substitution not a reduction in available expressions summary i can get along perfectly well without this verbal excretions author three cheers to the académie française a bastion of resistance against politically correct linguistic butchery
français nest pas une langue cest impérialisme linquistique
beurk if there is anything worse than than french spelling it is french typography
the hypocrisy of the academicians is breathtaking claiming the language is going to be destroyed by political correctness when the rules they are defending were explicitly invented for political reasons and not all that long ago
eliminate masculine and feminine forms altogether that is the stupidest thing i have ever read why not just go back to grunting while youre at it me want food me pluck berries and hunt woolly mammoth me always say less when referring to quantifiable things
they do you should hear my daughter on the subject
as a frenchenglish translator living in france i would say no this grammatical rule is less about the possible sexism that it could promote than political correctness gone mad often in english i am forced to use the cumbersome heshe hisher throughout translations when the french is masculine or even worse imho use sheher when its probably a man this is one of the few natural advantages of french and should not be changed i dont believe it affects womens equality issues or bothers many people here corrigezmoi si je me trompe
surely the point being made is that once again the académie française looks as if it wants to control by artificial means something which will always evolve naturally despite external interference they see attempts to put restrictions in place as a threat to french whatever the origin of the motive and are in some ways prisoners of their own mandate something as fundamental to french as noun and adjective gender will take many centuries to disappear
i wish they would do this for german
magrittes ceci nest pas une pipe has always puzzled me why do the french consider a pipe feminine ive simply given whatever the reason may be the famous gallic shrug its bizarre but i like it vive la difference
acting isnt gender neutral
as a woman i find these articles thoroughly demeaning im no less a woman because im an actress rather than an actor quite the opposite the word actress emphasizes my femininity and be off with you with your genderneutral language nonsense gender equality is achieved by education and changes in attitudes not pious journalists imposing ludicrous and impractical rules which makes you giggle at the sight of them language is a thing of beauty and french one of the most beautiful of all
why stop at words for gods sake i say abolish men and womens sexist haircuts everyone should be tonsured only the crown of hair should be required to grow down over the ears we could call this a mashi maleshei but why leave it at hair femichauvinist make up should be abolished too really where do women get off flaunting their macha by dolling themselves up makeup should be abolished but everyone should varnish their nails pink why stop there abolish the sheer horror of malefemale dress excuse the femisexist word dress no more men and womens clothes everyone should wear a skant that is a skirtpant that is a broad skirt a triple wide kilt sown up the middle and then there is the issue of apartheit bathrooms apartheit is bad evil phooey remember sa along with multiculturalism we need multisexual bathrooms only the multi sex needs to be uni sex i suggest mandatory bowls for all ie no standing this idea of men and women having different effluent practices is really offensive to me public money should not be used to enforce such invidious distinctions focusing on words alone is a typical liberal token half measure that ignores the real horror of malefemale differentiation
but thats what it means lefthanded people should rise in outraged protest
as in most indoeuropean languages the masculine and feminine forms were originally used for meterial and abstract concepts respectively before they referred to men and women for example the medical field is la médecine féminine and the doctor is le médecin masculin regardless of the gender of the doctor
cette histoire est une imbécilité point barre
um breastfeeding in public or rather taboos against it are far from inconsequential
effectively we have sinister has pretty much lost its meaning of lefthanded
people seem more bothered in england than over here it doesnt really matter language is full of prejudicial ideas sinister means lefthanded are we going to change that
i have looked into this the words they suggest as gender neutral are an uncomfortable feeling in the part of your body you sit on i am all for more power to women i am one after all but the words are not only unelegant they are unpronouncable and a reason why men mock feminists they tried the same in german and we got the infamous mock of bürger and bürgerinnensteig citizen walk instead of pedestrian walk but it would be the same if you said fußgängerweg with a male and a female version of citizen and more mock examples like mandarines becoming womandarines mantel becoming womantel mantel is the german word for coat you cannot force change in language you can try to use real neutral words where applicable instead of wähler or wähler und wählerinnen you can use wählende voter male and female voter or the people voting but this does not fit everywhere in the interest of keeping texts readable and not risible stop forcing artificial constructs on people i once read a book where all male forms were replaced by female forms it read strange it was a parody roleplayinggamerulebook but apart from that it still read strange

then king elizabeth and queen phillip it is
no they should not this ridiculous menace political correctness is also at the forefront here in sweden han hun or bloody hen he she or bloody e it is a disgrace that we even use time on this crap there far more serious and urgent matters to discusson the contrary it diminishes the fight for equality across genders in the same way that the struggle for womens rights have diminished by squabbling on inconsequential matters as armpit hair or hair on legs bra or no bra or breastfeeding in public
but la bite is feminine 
i for one am mildly amused by the way this newspaper consistently refers to actresses as actors as they have done in their coverage of the weinstein scandal an actress is an actress pay her some respect neutering her is hardly a compliment
english is primitive as compared to french meaning what that french was standardized earlier than english that it is more popular more universal more idiomatic btw the members of the académie française are known as the immortals make of that what you will
québec has been doing it for years but of course with the wrong accent really has quebec adopted gender neutral nounspronouns care to give a few examples
genderqueer isnt a philosophy genderqueer is just how some people are like man or womon
le chat est sur la table hope this helps when i was learning french in school one of the stories we read was called la petite jeune fille avec la grande bouche and she got that way because she insisted on saying poire when she should have been saying pomme i dont know if that story would have been académie française approved but i can well imagine the uproar it would cause today
rather we should create a gender neutral world
a comment like yours proves that brexit is at least worthy of consideration so please explain the logic of applying gender to inanimate objects i cant wait to read
yawn whatever potential there was in dealing with this subject is ruined by the lighthearted tone
gendered pronouns are also a pretty recent development in chinese too originally everyone was 他 but then due to western influence women became 她 both pronounced the same ta one great way ive seen chinese netizens deal with gender neutrality is by simply typing ta in pinyin
then why do thai men greet you with สวสดครบ but thai women say สวสดคะ
not unless you want hi saswasdee is gender neutral as is thanks khop khun khop jai to inferiors unless you add a gender signifier khrap m or kha f generally we dont bother too much with personal pronouns tenses or time its understood
not so english has masculine amp feminine forms eg he amp she if you referring to definite amp indefinite articles still wrong about thai it has no articles

first canute wasnt trying to hold back the sea he was proving to his followers that he couldnt he was only a mansecond this whole problem is european in thai for example we the same word khao for he and she him and her in fact we dont bother too much with personal pronouns since we usually know whos doing what with whom european languages need to advance a little more
i suppose not much of interest is going on in the world if people have time to debate such superficial subjects thank goodness no wars no famines no climate change yes time to focus on futilies which hardly qualify as news and while were a it let us not forget to march for the spanish hindi and lithianian languages since apparently we have nothing better to do than get angry at grammar rules put in place since the xvi century finally if you think the académie française doesnt accept change then youre ignoring all the new words that are accepted in the dictionnary every year now get over yourselves leave the french language alone and find a more meaningful cause to fight for
i wish youd sort out some policy on hyperlinks they can be genuinely useful but are so misused that usually i dont bother clicking in this article only the first the news article from which the piece derives is worth visiting the second is an unrelated opinion piece the third a translation that most people wouldnt need help with and the fourth is the guardians france page basically brand promotion its a shame ive read some articles where the blue text offers a glimpse of an instant informative and genuinely new reading experience and ive no objection to links within the guardian if theyre relevant
oui bas les pattes
le braque la queuele braquemard la birouteetc 
us english still makes use of the subjunctive sometimes certainly more than british english were i rich  versus if i was rich  although granted it is a fairly schlerotic form now the same is happening in french to a lesser degree and it is not impossible that the form will drop out of normal spoken usage in the future in spanish however the subjuntive is alive and well and still serves to express something different than the indicative
languages are always impure they borrow blend and innovate exactly borrowing blending and innovating are normal and perfectly natural things for a language to do but thats not what this is this is just coming across as agree with and embrace everything in the genderqueer philosophy and language or be incorrect and officially wrong its forced and ironically quite black and white almost binary
lets get rid of this flowery nonsense and all use newspeak
stop eating pure crack you are taking  nonsense source i speak native french
the fact that german has  genders has nothing to do with its relationship to latin but the fact that it is an indoeuropean language and that this language had three genders as many of the languages that derived from it many of these after further evolution dropped one modern romance languages or two of the genders but not all did hence german most modern slavic languages ancient and modern greek latin that retained three some languages such as polish have gone the other way and can be said to possess  genders neuterfemininmasculinanimateinanimate
you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled questce que
this is not specific to france in most countries married women tend to take their husbands surname for purposes of official identification knowing the name on their birth certificate is indeed useful
how do you know that you arent the one making the error really easy a f unlike english
i think it would be arrogant to say that québécois dont speak french well well they dont its a fact
for proper comparison you have to go back to the correct text not verbal shorthand

the roots of these are various for instance le brésil occurs thus because brasilbrazilbrésil is a thing a species of tropical wood which yielded a red dye when crushed and was the first tropical product exploited in brazil by the portuguese so when entering a romance language it required a gender masculine as it turned out in portuguese it is o brasil and the full name of brazil is a the or la república federativa do of the or du brasil
good grief this is the most stupid thing ive heard of but i suppose it was always going to happen theres such a thing as the rule of usage in france its done that way in germany the feminine form is the rule nobody is discriminated against theres no patriarchy at work or other wild conspiracy pulling strings stop with this shit already this publication is the first to scream fake news at anything remotely questionable yet when the patriarchy and evil sexism apparently is perpetuated by a grammatical rule thats the simple rule of usage thats taken as read

theyre still phonetic but just homophones easy peasey
i think allargando is saying its phonetic in the sense that a given combination of letters is always pronounced the same way even if not all the letters are separately voiced eg ils parlaient
no harder than prepositions and phrasal verbs in german lack of genders a massive plus pointspelling is a bastard admittedly
i think english sentence structure is quite easy unless you are referring to phrasal verbs german has less flexibility so is a bit harder
definitely english spelling is very difficultas well as phrasal verbs look it up in a dictionary has learners of english looking at the ceilingbtw i copied and pasted in another post to you something that came out as schleiffen when of course it should have been schlieffen now i dont trust the source or sause
sorry you also completely miss the pointits about the convention which form should be used for a mixed grouplanguage also determines the way we think the masculine form omits the women in the group we should change this its only fair
a lot of post discussing grammatical gender completely miss the point describing a mixedgender group youre forced to pick one by convention its the masculine we had a similar discussion in germany if in doubt be polite and use the female plural in most cases that will include the male plural it works for most french words too so a mixed group is called députées simple

hey that could work lets see die lehrenden die politikierenden die polizeirenden die straßenbahnführenden until some fool decides that it must be studierendinnen und studierenden
in french youd actually say sire votre majesté estelle prête pour la guillotine  instead 
presumably because it was considered male property while verge is feminine which makes everything nicely symmetrical
ahhh taggart theres bin a mrrrda
i think everyone is mistranslating négation to negative do double negatives even exist in french as you know im sure it is very common to drop the ne as in jen sais rien whats that a half negative and thanks for patronising me i know how it works and its still her basket and her umbrella unless she was taking m lapins stuff
bollo what
un astéroïde with the trema very good those two little dots are dying out most zoës and cloës and noëls have dropped their tremas citroën as well i think arthur conan doyle was probably the last author to use one in coöperation
dont worry la chatte is feminine
leobviously
presumably because it was considered male property
nepas isnt a double negative the french think that is a double negative but they dont mean that in the same way as the english double negative which is grammatically incorrect for example the schoolchilds excuse i havent done nothing more usually rendered as i aint done nuffin logically means that he has some something what he hanst dome is learn decent english
in some contexts one wants to specify the gender but not always in many contexts one explicitly does not want to specify the gender because the masculine has been taken for a long time to include the feminine generally especially in plurals using the correct noun doesnt even achieve unambiguous precision better to have gender neutral nouns and add an appropriate adjective such as male when desired by context as we do with most rolejob nouns
forget brexit amen but is it le brexit ou la brexit 
no no the speaker must say stundentinnen und studenten thats why today mostly the inclusive die studierenden is used its not that hard
some germanic languages like dutch kept the neuter but combined the masculine and feminine leaving two genders german is not a romance language like french spanish and italian are it is a germanic language a group that includes dutch danish swedish norwegian icelandic which preserves three genders and cases and declensions and english it would be more correct to say that english contains more germanic words than to say that german contains more anglosaxon words the angles and saxons came to britain from parts of what is now germany
verb structure not very structure
arabic has changed a great deal over the years moroccan arabic and gulf arabic are almost mutually unintelligible i find moroccan arabic very difficult a lot of berber i guess algerian not too bad i think they had egyptian teachers tunisia has a lot of french and simplified very structure with female only appearing for rd person sing otherwise no distinction but the arabic component is reasonably recognisable you just need to know the smattering of italian french etc that has been included eloutiil the hotel for example but even in individual countries they have significant variations for example changes in the vowel sounds meh for water in tunis mah in sfax
an apostrophe before a plural s is not correct in any type of english thats not even correct australian english see australian workers union notice how the official name of australias largest labor union does it correctly httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaustralian_workers_union the earlier commentator already explained why they use either gender in a arbitrary fashion its to eliminate the gender inflection of occupations
replace québécois with sénégalais and wonder how wrong you sound what a colonialistic attitude what a very odd comment you mean that if i made a negative comment about the quality of senegalese french this would be a colonial attitude but its ok to be critical of the quebecois please clarify in english we note the systematic errors that appear in our language when spoken by different subgroups for example the indians like to convert everything to participles this is also true of foreign french speakers a senegalese would only have to speak a few words to be picked up as being west african similarly the systematic errors in north african french including scrambling the genders of some words that have a different gender in arabic for example but then again people from marseilles two friends of mine from the lozere systematically referred to as polacks by the englishspeaking quebecois throughout a year they spent in uni over there were thrown out of a pub for talking about their children the southern french attribute an extraordinary range of meanings to the word testicles variants on couillons including as a means of referring to their children too many repetitions of the word testicles for the straight laced barperson in any case interestingly even the more generally used gosses kids in most places in france goes down badly in quebec

yes oe and german share many roots another favourite of mine is gategait from norse gata and german gazzagatta for road or street commonly misinterpreted in old northern and scottish towns to mean gate as in town gate whereas it often just means street gate itself has a slightly different etymology meaning gap or opening york once a norse city has an abundance of gates meaning street gates are called bars see here both words crop up in micklegate bar where mickle means great as in many a mickle small amount makes a muckle great amount analogous to look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves canongate in edinburgh is another example of where the scots gait morphed into gate to mean the church canons street or way gait also means a method of walking he had a strange gait but according to this source probably derives from the old french guêtre and has no known connection with either waystreet or walking a strange coincidence or what
where did i say i didnt like this paper or that i wasnt interested in the piece in questionnow this waste of bandwidth here just when you think weve reached peak guardian we hit a higher peak guardian first of all last weeks pitiful and selfrighteous drivel about virtue signalling now this waste of bandwidth it really is about time that the author found something useful to do with his time maybe writing about something that matters it was only a couple of hours ago 
can i name one yep sure yob yes id thought about yob but i dont think it endured much of a slide compared to the slide from sweetheart to tart for example it was always slang never standard english and the users of back slang tended to be an underclass so the word was associated with the users please try again

it may well have been the policyand it wasnt perhaps a wholly bad policybut the reality was of course different as the prevalence of doublebarreled names would testify at least until people believed it was a mark of sophistication unaware of the implications of bastardy the slutstud thing is interesting but i doubt even the academic feminists really believed in their liberty and the majority of studs ive met have been pleased as punch to be regarded as such its one way to spend your time i suppose i guess contraception is an effective barrier to unwanted physical effects such as pregnancybut intimacy tends to cause feelings to develop no contraception for dealing with them ive sometimes wondered are promiscuous folks less inclined to develop feelings and thus dont suffer in this wayor is it more after a series of such encounters they dont develop easily or at all anymoreor does the damage just sort of accumulate and drives you further and further along a path looking for love but only finding sex
all  of his examples are well out of use governess ffs which makes his insight redundant the fact that sexist language was common in my greatgrandads time barely warrants a passing mention let alone an article
are other languages sexist at heart or is it just evil english that have evil words for these evil things yknow the english being evil and all that
wow from an article on attempted censorship to the real thing having read them i imagine it was because the comments succeeded in picking apart the entire substance of the article it might have been more honourable to replace the article with an apology for its mistakenness
where he studied or what his specialisation isis irrelevant its actually quite relevant he studied linguistics the article is about the evolution of language and sociolinguistics perhaps not your cup of tea but its certainly a subject that matters to many re the nawaz article this was not an attack in fact some of it was sympathetic to nawazs position but also offered some critical perspectives on his role in working with the conservative government on questionable policies re their effectiveness on deradicalisation in fact the author has written elsewhere many times about other ways in which to combat radicalisation among muslims its not like his agenda is prodaesh he just proposes different routes to the same end
wench a thcentury word meaning a female infant or a young unmarried woman quickly acquired negative connotations from the late th century in langland and chaucer it is used to mean a wanton woman a mistress since we are being so cuttingly up to date can we bring back strumpet harlot and harridan please so much more colourful than their modern equivalents

i agree madam isnt necessarily negative even as a brothel owner the others back up the point though i think what is the male version of tart a negative term for someone who is everyones sweetheartwhat is the negative term for a man who is unmarriedwhy did these words become negative when referring to women but not to men
i agree with the author history stays with us and there are many derogatory words to describe women women are still called witches for example but men arent called warlocks and the words describing women as animals bitch dog cowgood article but depressing esp the comments

the denigration of half of the population has embedded itself in the language in ways you may not even be aware of this is something of an exaggeration it would only be denigration of half the population if the words applied to the entire half the fact that hussy derives from housewife does not mean every housewife is a hussy it is a small subset and madam or mistress do not always carry pejorative meanings any more than master does it is interesting that there are terms that are derogatory to women in that sort of a sense but that surely demonstrates the different roles women had in society words like prat and berk are almost always directed at men and go back a long way because men had more opportunity to be prats and berks they emerged as derogatory words almost from the off and then you have tit which is a good thing on a woman but a bad thing for a man ive never heard a woman called a tit no matter how pendulous her bosom

a quick search of google books suggests that the phrase rabid feminist has been in use for over a century although there are usually only snippets available to illustrate usage the earliest use that i could find there was a in a periodical from  the social democrat a monthly socialist review where ernest belfort bax i think starts a sentence with the rabid feminist might easily retort  the phrase then appears occasionally in periodicals throughout the following two decades although it seems most often to be used to deny the appropriateness of the term eg lest i be thought a rabid feminist  one need not be a rabid feminist to suggest  interestingly elizabeth kemper adamss women professional workers a study made for the womens educational and industrial union macmillan  talks about both rabid feminists and rabid antifeminists

and if feminist follows rabid as a contemporary example of collocation then it show how far we havent moved why does a person identifying as a feminist preclude them acting in a way that could be labelled as rabid im not saying that its helpful in discussions or that it will always be used accurately but are you objecting to a negative term being used to describe something you only see in terms of positives misogyny does not appear to be endemic in western culturesociety
the point is that words that are used to denote the position of a woman in society which used to have positiveneutral meanings have over the years taken on negative meaningsconnotations and are often used as insults nowadays its obvious there are lots of ways to insult men that is beside the point can you think of an example of where a similar thing has happened to a word used to describe the positionstatus of men

for example i could say labelling a movement as rapid feminism is offensive you could then e me when writing your dictionary as saying rapid feminism is offensive this would be using the same words as i did but because youve left out the context that i used them in the meaning is completely different to that which i intended
context is everything

whats your point just because these two examples are now no longer in common use doesnt disprove the pejoration effect
oh i read the article as well i am not one of those straight to the comments people measured is not a word i would have chosen
we could argue about the usage of master certainly it speaks of authority in some situations ships master for instance but has also been reduced to the formal form of address for a boy not an adult man whilst this is not derogatory it is a diminuation of the previous usage interestingly of course the diminutive of mistress miss is hardly ever seen as derogatory its not so clear as the article would have it

for example spinster women were more likely to be spinsters so theyre more likely to be called spinsterstartsweetheart was obviously because it became a sarcastic way to refer to a woman who seeemed to be everyones sweetheartmadam was used as a politediscreet way of referring to the manager of a brothel it also gets used in a positive way and a neutral way

oh no theyre not etc but seriously even this argument about rabid feminist isnt even about removing words from the dictionary or redefining them only the more minor question of whether that was a suitable editorially neutral choice of example usage i dont really give a crap about that example and im sure one could find other biased examples in the dictionary but its just hysterical to depict it as the op did
pssst read the article before commenting
however i picked up on the fact that six of the eight words used are pretty archaic they are not quite chaucerian if it could get away with it the guardian would ban chaucer
or the antifeminists who seek to undermine feminism by associating it with pejorative adjectives such as rabid you mean ann oakley the feminist author whose book taking it like a woman was ed from in the dictionary that antifeminist

maybe you failed to notice this in the article these eight words show how social conditions leave their mark on the language the process of pejoration may take place below the level of consciousness but in historical perspective the direction of travel is obvious if doubt susie dent would think it a very controversial observation to notice that social conditions tend to influence the way language evolves it also requires no conspiracy theories whatsoever

because there are no derogatory terms which apply to men which are also in the dictionary right wanker wanker is a term applied to men
the difference being your counter examples are all true observed male behaviour while the article is about things that have been made up by men in order to denigrate women nothing to do with their behaviour at all your comment is a really great example of male stupidity and why the world is still such a sexist place
at that colloquially is the prime usage of it
its not the job of a dictionary to police the english language but to record its usage that exact point is made in the article which makes me wonder whether you read it
whats the right adjective to describe a feminist who allies herself unthinkingly and unquestioningly to a congenital liar and phoney and helps her to publicly destroy a harmless mans reputation and career and then airbrushes the whole event from history when it becomes apparent that her hero is a total mountebank and fantasist and her story and everything else about her is a pack of lies

all those words mean the person is stupid or unpleasant they dont have the sexual sluttish connotation of the words mentioned in the article what like governess and spinster cos theyre so sluttish and sexual right
on tyneside tart was used to mean girlfriend up until the late  early  just thought you might be interested in that
i think its interesting too everyone here is getting so offendedthere are definitely offensive words for men in the dictionary but are there words which fit into the pattern the author is talking about starting as neutral then degrading to be more negative than the female counterparti agree that there is no point accusing the dictionary of being unfair because they are supposed to reflect the way language is used and they are doing the author also makes that point though in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world
what are you his mum or something where he studied or what his specialisation is you say its linguistics but in this case id say it was fingerpointing selfrighteousness and sjwism is irrelevant we have to go on the evidence this article is banal in its observations and rather sinister in its intentagenda
sinister orwellianism im sure the author would be flattered at your estimation of his power but i think youre jumping at shadows kev

i often say buy that news reader a dictionary because they dont get a phrase right or use made up words however recently i feel that the dictionary people need a dictionary rabid doesnt automatically go to feminist and should not be defined as a conjunction of  or more words rabid stands on its own as an adjective dictionaries should stick to defining existing words stay away from emoji and joining words together let writers and speakers use the words to flatter offend placate or enrage and for pitys sake leave bogan speak alone

i dont think i have ever heard the term manageress written or spoken before so i doubt its a good example of simple english it certainly sounds much more awkward than the term actually used in fact it sounds rather like the mild sexism you might hear used by older middleaged men when trying to be arch and funny this is not a denigration of all middleaged men just noting this is the language my dad and his sadder friends would use as opposed to younger similarly unamusing people it would be especially inappropriate in the context of an article talking about sexism in language
the dictionary gives the example of rabid in relation to a dog with rabies already though

any well informed article exploring the origins of the english language is always interesting more of it please however arent there as many derogatory words for men see below for examples those words might be seen as less hurtful because men tend to use them against each other or even welcome them because they distinguish bad behaviour that enhances their status if the dictionary has examples of common usage involving denigration of men they have not been unfair to anyone
dont worry a lot of commenters are have totally missed the point as wellthis sentence from the article should help you the crucial thing to remember is that at one time they were simply equivalents its not about who has the most negative words ascribed to them though on a separate point a lot of negative words referring to men are negative because they liken them to women it is about words describing females becoming more negative overtime presumably because they describe females

but but the patriarchy or something look you did wrong even if i cant articulate it and you didnt mean to thats the only possible scenario here no no dont apologize then youll just be mansplaining and we cant have that look ive got some time tonight between my wiccan soapmaking group and my drum circle why dont we meet up at that new coop that serves those amazing cruelty free salads and ill fill you in on the new rules try not to oppress anyone till then yeah
what you or i make of the article are by the by the gist of it is that the english language is sexist which is misogynist which is primitive isnt it however i just think its a minor matter compared to the misogyny that takes place on a grand scale in at least a quarter of the world and this rarely if ever gets discussed by the journalists only the punters so i felt like saying so is that alright
theres no argument in the article just pseudoargument and nonsequiturs
my courtesan has taken umbrage at your ageist remark
all eight put in shadow of that most connotative and sexist phrase of all working for the man my outrage and insultation at my gender literally being used to define systemic oppression is bad enough more despairing writing an article about it and having it published in the guardian is unlikely to score me a shag perhaps this author will have better luck
i challenge you to come up with five words that are the male equivalent of tart why stop at five a couple of seconds on google words for a promiscuous man reveals many morehttpsenwiktionaryorgwikiwikisauruspromiscuous_man however the real point is that some people consider tart when used to describe a woman as being insulting that is them making a value judgement that for a woman being promiscuous is a bad thing that is where its sexist not in describing a woman as a tart but in the interpretation that the hearer makes that tart bad
nagging husband
how do you know it isnt
or just post what you like without wading through hundreds of other comments others like me who havent bothered either and are reading the joke for the first time will still appreciate it
i agree that when there is a sexist bias in society as surely there is in ours then this will be reflected in language on the other hand i doubt that the point can be soundly grounded by picking out a series of words that suit the thesis without a serious attempt to look for counterexamples  thus if we consider parenthood the word absent is most likely to be couple with father the word wanker is overwhelmingly reserved for men we speak of man flu but not woman flu reference to a mans feminine side is likely to be positive but not so for a womans masculine side men and their toys does not have a female equivalent it is commonly said that men are led by their dicks i have not come across a female equivalent we speak of macho culture and that is not intended to be complementary the expression jobs for the boys is not a positive one this is all off the top of my head without any significant effort and no research i am sure if i made some effort i could think of or find lots more so without denying a sexist bias in language i think it needs rather more careful substantiation than the one offered here

what do you think of when i say the word rabid one option according to the dictionary publisher oxford dictionaries is feminist its not according to the dictionary publisher oxford dictionaries its according to feminist author ann oakley whose work the dictionary was ing
sadly all terms to do with women eventually become derogatory male terms become complimentary landlord and landlady thats fine butdog and bitchwizard and witchbull and cowstud and cow whats worse is that even the word woman is becoming a term of abuse you have to call a woman a lady now even one you dont know there was a man and a lady doing some shopping a few years ago if you call her a woman its beginning to imply that she is a prostitute so you have to say lady but you dont need to call a man the equivalent which is a lord nobody would say there was a lord and a lady doing some shopping its women who are the main culprits for this they call other women ladies to be wellmeaning or to please them but thereby degrade the word woman and its the competitive nature between them which makes a man a wizard but a woman a witch and so on its not men who are the cause
oh dear how dare the vocabulary of yesteryear change its meaning over timeas for rabid feminists someone could run a concordance search online and find out not only the frequency of the term but the time in which the term has been in use this would determine whether or not current usage could be claimed

good going blame the oed for how english speakers have used words
what youre annoyed that them article was written what did you find a bit much about it specifically
at what point does the writer say that we need to change language i think youve missed the point unless ive missed it too i think the point is that the way we use language reflects the way we think after all the words he uses as examples havent changed but the meanings we commonly ascribe to them have if we can indeed change the thinking then the language should change to reflect that thinking

people of certain nationalities trades or whatever may be offended by some example sentences as well why not make this kind of analysis
the example sentences we use are taken from a huge variety of different sources and do not represent the views or opinions of oxford university press that said we are now reviewing the example sentence for rabid to ensure that it reflects current usage it does reflect the current usage ignore the noise from twitter stand up for yourselves instead of folding like a damp lettuce taking twitter seriously is like taking youtube comments seriously its just naughty children chuckling at how transgressive they are

well yes since rape definition under uk law requires perpetrator to be at least anatomically male it is quite correct
the point is that the examples are a selection of current usage not an exhaustive list it shouldnt be hard to find different example phrase that doesnt portray a negative stereotype oh i see dictionaries ought only to show us the positive examples that make us feel good whilst protecting our feelings by avoiding any negative usages so similar to safe spaces in unis but in this case applied to the dictionary
to be reconsidered following twitter storm get thicker skin and tell em to come out of the storm and go where the sun shines
 and phrases role of dictionary is to document the language not to shape it or prevent undesirable thoughts

the mere fact of a twitterstorm is reason enough never to apologise regardless save twitter for jokes politics and sociological issues actually take some thought

one of the things i have always admired about the oxford dictionary and english dictionaries generally is that they see their role as recording the language not defining itamerican dictionaries on the other hand are seen as giving the definitive meaning of words by what or whose authority if the language of a community even if that community is the entire englishspeaking world is sexist in its tendencies then the oxford should be reflecting that in the examples it usesand i am neither british nor american though english is my mother tongue oops is that a sexist usage
httpwwwoxforddictionariescomdefinitionenglishdicka stupid or contemptible manhmmm
considering theres generally uncontrollable outrage by feminists most weeks especially in this paper seems a rather apt example
a rabid feminist is heard shrilly nagging the oed i cant fathom the psyche that would object to examples of actual usage of language but these types of incidents are grating im talking about a man of course
if the example sentences are chosen from an uptodate british english corpus then there is no dilemma the sentences merely reflect the sociocultural attitudes in the society at that point in history whether we like the sentences or not is therefore irrelevant they paint a picture of that moment in time 
psst the words are all still in the dictionary
lets talk about some other examples then rapist a person typically a man who commits rape and thats not an example sentence either its the definition
a few examples selected from a very big book where the choice of gender pronoun is perhaps slightly unfortunate illustrates that the entire parent company which produced the book is institutionally sexist do you not think that might be a slight overreaction
are you raging
apparently some of us believe that dictionaries ought to be compiled using the methods that were once used in the old soviet union to ensure that certain truths be maintained in their dictionaries but this hardly sounds like progress
i see twatter is giving a disproportionate amount of airtime again to some twits
to impose change by edict risks the accusation of seeking to bring in the thought police and this will ultimately lead to unpc words going underground
the dictionary needs to reflect usage in addition the origin of wordsphrasescollocations reflects the time they were createdcoined languages change over time but that change is often slower than the change in attitudes words like nagging and shrill are strongly associated with women i have done a bit of teaching in my time when these words come up i need to make students aware of how theyre used i often apologise for the sexist nature of some words and phrases and point out that languages are the product of the societies in which they developed these societies have been on the whole male dominated
indeed also associated with safe space a place some people go to when they cant cope with words
but you can be a rabid feminist in the same way you can be a rabid misogynist i think people need to get a grip on reality here instead of whining about something the really bares little significance in the grand scheme of things
precisely its a widely used collocation from wiki a sequence of words or terms that cooccur more often than would be expected by chancethe adjective rabid and the noun feminist frequently occur together
the point is that the examples are a selection of current usage not an exhaustive list it shouldnt be hard to find different example phrase that doesnt portray a negative stereotype
out of step hey that phrase sums up the whole institutionally correctist mindset in three little words maybe it should expunged from all dictionaries everywhere now
definition of twitter storm complete bollocks others may also apply
the dictionary is quite a big book isnt it there are bound to be examples where theyve chosen a personal pronoun which might be seen as unfortunate if youre so inclined took me about s on google to find this definition from oxford dictionaries definition of murder in english noun the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by anotherthe brutal murder of a german holidaymakermass noun he was put on trial for attempted murder will no one soothe my offended sensibilities because society thinks murderers are male woe is me
comments such as this are like a nagging toothache
so in the choices made perhaps they can choose examples that dont reinforce negative stereotypes that would require them to recognise negative stereotypes the problem then is that there seem to be so many im not sure that anyone could be expected to know about all todays negative stereotypes let alone predict next years ones or those of the year after
except rabid feminist isnt the most common usage of metaphorical rabid so you cant really use that excuse
nobodys asking the oed to become gender neutral or for historical language to be rewritten youre coming across as a bit rabid there
it seems that anthropology phd candidate michael omanreagan has not understood the function of the oxford english dictionary any more than mcdonalds did when they petitioned the oed to have the word mcjob removed the oed does not define anything it records usage among the englishspeaking population the adjective rabid has wrongly in my view which counts for nothing long been adopted to mean having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something as the oed describes it to illustrate this acknowledged definition it must provide an instance when it has been used as it does for every other definition in present of past english usage it so happens that this word has been applied to feminist perhaps the person being ed was being sexist perhaps they identified a strain of feminist ideology which they perceived to exceed the reasonable demands for equality into something a little less balanced but that is neither here nor there either way the usage they e is not the fault of the oed
the are not authors but lexicographers they record and describe the language as used by the people who have spoken and written it over the centuries they dont make it up themselves
though in all the examples the words are going to refer to one gender or another yes but that doesnt actually seem to be the issue the issue seems to be that are more references to one gender than another the issue is that the ones that use the female pronoun appear to be more likely to use negative stereotypes than the ones that use the male pronoun fine to use he or she in the definitions but not so fine if most of the she definitions are being used to express negative stereotypes when most of the he ones arent
yeah thats all people are asking for i think some kind of overview to look at whether examples are proportionate in both amount and kind eg what proportion of examples using each gender are negative
this perfectly illustrates how out of step the oup is surprise surprise theyre institutionally sexist
clearly the ministry of truth has to take charge of oxford dictionary and remove all ungood words and phrases every measure taken to prevent thoughtcrime should be considered plusgood
nagging is mostly used about women unfortunately perhaps by slightly sexist men and rabid collocates strongly with feminist too again due to its use by conservative people that said the dictionary should use less sexist examples of the other words
i think the academic is right to query using sexist examples of language yes they are real world examples and the dictionary should reflect real usage but rabid feminist really there would be hundreds of years of racist and antisemitic language including current use by some people that the dictionary could use as examples but i bet they consider this very carefully and rightly so sexist language is so ingrained and accepted that we often dont consider it

yes please change such entries in the oed i think it should be remembered however that the oed is descriptive not prescriptive so as long as the changes represent a representative sample of the lexigon itll be all right
get a life
that would of course be the speakers of the english language throughout the world the oed merely records our use of language amp does not make any determinations as to english usage itself
but is it their job to record every single attested collocation in the oed in the examples chosen for a particular word clearly not so in the choices made perhaps they can choose examples that dont reinforce negative stereotypes
a rabid feminist doesnt have to be a woman so the critique of sexism cannot be validated by the reasoning given
the trouble is most of those example sentences are ones ive heard in everyday life at some point as others have said the dictionary has to reflect actual usage that wives are described as nagging is itself an issue but that doesnt mean we cant pretend its not one of the most common usages for that word change attitudes clichés and stereotypes which are sexist dont start with the dictionary which merely accurately reflects those
i am sure there are many entries including the female pronoun shall we have them removed for equality the point isnt the number of entries that include the male or female pronoun the point is that the ones that refer to women as ed in the article are stereotypes often negative and the ones that refer to men arent nobodys saying you cant use male or female pronouns or that definitions should be genderneutral
you think gender equality is the real issue cant agree i think morons habitually demanding the right to censor stuff they dont like is the real issue its more widespread and more normalised with every year that passes i grew up in a country where censorship was fairly widespread and i dont want to go back to that to hell with the sensitivities of people who dont even know what a dictionary is for
perhaps but nagging husbands are as common as nagging wives and it would only be fair to use the male pronoun for a few hundred years
dont forget racial religious ethnic and disability status diversity not to mention hair colour weight etc
definition of misogynistic oxford dictionary authors
and if one takes the time to peruse the oed one will find that it has entries for various ethnic amp racial slurs that are far nastier when used than is rabid feminist i assume then that the existence of these words must also be purged from the record as well
rabid morons are the ones you have to worry about
i dont see anything wrong in their choice of language
attack on language and the causes of language words another way to indirectly attack the civilisation and culture that has decided in their freedom of expression to use words and language
so the dictionary reflects everyday usage which is it seems still sexist better to change the usage and the dictionary will follow than change the dictionary so it no longer shows the world as it is
hardly surprising that the mob has brought this spurious argument to the oed similar campaigns have already been waged by roma people who dislike certain widely heard senses of certain words in portuguese and spanish it was only a matter of time before other groups would cotton on if the usage rabid feminist is an attested collocation then its the lexicographers job to record it
i wish people would stop apologising after a twitter storm
rabid feminist the oxford dictionary can always be rely on to tell the truth
though in all the examples the words are going to refer to one gender or another when it refers to the usage applying to people identified by sex or gender identification or personal name how many would be referring to men husbands brothers the problem would be if there is a lack of proportion in the use of gendered examples
clearly this just proved the point of rabid feminist i am sure there are many entries including the female pronoun shall we have them removed for equality all this detracts from the real issue that women should be treated equally in everything it does not mean that we should stop using the term he or she and we should not rewrite historical language just because somebody wants it to be gender neutral
uh the oed exists to record the language as its used and not merely to express what the rabid ideologues see what i did there think ought to be the proper usages if certain words such as shrill are at times used in a certain way then the dictionary ought to record that regardless of whether or not some may think it too sexist or too this or too that
youvevlist me
well as unlike cows milk does not have an actual gender it us whatever they decide it is
it isnt illogical it is a different logic and as matthias berger points out if you want to talk about internal illogicality then english probably reigns supremeas in english if you want to cut a tree up you first have to cut it down 
bollocses
in france everything refers to sex 
nothing we kinda need it but whats wrong with not highlighting gender every time something is written or worse defaulting everyone to being male
the hungarian language lacks the norm of revealing the gender of a person right away as both male and female are just called person instead of heshe it makes reading detective and crime stories in hungarian more interesting as you dont get the gender of the culprit right away especially for stories where the murderer is revealed right away because there is only a single female in the whole cast it works well but im uncertain if you could enforce changes by decree in any language
know it odesnt make it any more precise becsuse you dont need the distinction for other jobs and the problem is that use of a feminine form for job dedcriotions are usually used as a way to mahe a distinction between the serioysmake professional and the not so serious female its often belittling and totally unnecessarythe actor eva blah blah the doctor eva bkah blah the writer eva blah bkahno need to have a feminine form unless yr point is to make a distinction between how men and women do the same job
the subjunctive is grammatically redundant and there is no need to invent parallel approximations in english in french of spanish you use the subjunctive when you have a verb of desire followed by a dependent clause yo espero que vayas i hope that you go this is completely redundant there is no reason to create a different verb tense after a verb of desire the fact that it is a verb of desire already gives you all the information you need that its merely a wish and not a real event
a comment likes this helps me understand why people think brexit is a good idea built on an unwillingness to understand anything foreign it isnt stupid it simply belongs to a different logical system
im just as confident that it wont french may be strongly gendered but grammatical gender has very little to do with sexual gender its only foreign learners whose minds boggle at the fact that in germany your fork is feminine your spoon is masculine and your knife is neutral
the queen in jersey is still refered as le duc she is also the duke of lancaster
who knows mebbe
there are german words of uncertain gender but butter is not one of them that page is a little misleading at first sight but it does say quite clearly that it is die butter teil is one in some meanings it is der in others das and in yet others it may be either very difficult for nonnatives like me some words vary according to region but i dont have an example at my fingertips to offerexamples like der band and das band are something different as they count as different words and have different plural forms in ordinary modern usage
one of the weaknesses of english is not having a subjunctive which ends up in needing to invent parallel approximations
thata what i love about trying to speak french you have a go and the next moment you are flooded with corrections the french speak french and it is not like english no way the trick is to learn to speak what the french actually say in english and then translate then one can see the problem eg mere lapin prend son panier et son parapluie sorry no accents mother rabbit takes his basket and his umbrella when you get this french becomes much easier to learn or not
intriguingly until recently in france for official documents a wife was obliged to give her name twice once with her maiden name a second time for her nom dusage way she is known married name and for bureaucratic purposes the second was definitely secondary this was officially changed some years ago but some parts of french bureaucracy still address official documents to my wife only under her nom de jeune fille maiden name
yes but will it eventually lead to eva or debbie wiseperson
it doesnt matter the direction its greek and was a loan word from greek in latinits a greek word that probably travelled through latin to other languages but then latin spread a lot of greek language and ideas about the origin is still greek
romance lanaguages should keep gender but get rid of the subjunctive its blows
yes the academys dictionary is regarded as official and any writer or researcher of the french language will refer to it as a matter of course that doesnt necessarily mean theyll agree with it or follow it though british or american english has no such authoritative resource certainly not one that is free to all users online
une personne can be male or female and une victime
 whereas english is going the other way and getting rid of the feminine form eg actress afaik thats only this paper this is something i dont understand at all as this distinction makes the language more precise and that is something that is usually sought after
i just meant easier when it comes to languages may not be an advantage
la bite
problema is from greek careful there i cannot be certain for spanish but the etymology of problem as given for english by the oxford english dictionary tends to suggest that it too presumably came from latin origin of multiple origins partly a borrowing from french partly a borrowing from latin etymons french problème latin problēma etymology lt middle french problème c with reference to aristotle french problème and its etymon classical latin problēma question proposed for academic discussion only in plural problēmata also as title of a work by aristotle nd cent ad in postclassical latin also puzzle riddle vulgate lt ancient greek πρόβληματ πρόβλημα question proposed for solution set task in logic question as to whether a statement is true of course ultimately from greek but since spanish basically evolved from latin i would be willing to bet that the spanish problema in fact came from latin rather than directly from greek
you miss my point perhaps because i put it badly i wasnt talking about predicting how a word would be spelled but about predicting how a written word would be pronounced what i was getting at is that the same group of letters in different words in french will generally be pronounced in the same way cf english though thought through that is if you know how a group of letters is pronounced and you encounter a new word containing that group you have a better chance of pronouncing it correctly if its a french word than if its english our french students of english certainly find that to be the case and a difficulty which theyre not used to theyre particularly confused by words which use different stress to differentiate between the noun and the verb eg projecti take your point about consonants at the end of words but thats relatively rare
and the milk
the lack of the grammatical complications of gender and cases and declinations and adjectival agreement make english an easy language to learn because it is easier to construct grammatically correct sentences english shows us that it is perfectly possible to do away with these bizarrities i carefully do not mention english orthography
agreed
clearly not for you 
thats true for most languages
what is wrong with gender
ahyouve not read it then its very funny for anyone thats ever tried to learn any foreign language with cases and shit go read it its funny and most of the stuff he rants about are the same probs for greek learnersits not an atrack on german its a pisstake of poor lang learners duh
do you really think it is an advantage when it comes to languages the more difficult to learn the more pleasant to read and to speak and also to learn you learn bizarrities and so doing you become deeply acquainted with secrets
easy at a basic level present tense verbs are a doddlebut at advanced levels maddening
surely the reason cows are feminine is pretty obvious
le penis
english is primitive as compared to french that is a completely pointless statement how on earth do you want to measure it
i think english is an easy language to get started in but a difficult one to become proficient at
if you live in a country permanently theres no excuse for not learning the language not least because you will always be an outsider if you dont and you will never understand the country culture or people of the place you live
bien sûr
youre asking me on the e i pulled out of allargandos comment that i responded to i dont know if thats true in french or not it is in spanish youd have to take that question to him
it would help me if they got rid of the idea of gender for inanimate objects altogether like we did in english about  years ago when norman french and anglosaxon collided and the go betweens decided it was a lot easier to drop the conflicting ideas about the nominal gender of things never quite sure why the french decided the penis is feminine
i meant easy in relation to other languages not easy in an absolute sense as reported by people who have learnt more than one foreign language you dont have to pass as a native speaker to make good use of english to communicate though ive met two people who could one german and one dutch so its possible even if not necessary
the guardian can use any style it likes in its writing all papers have a style guide
in greek coffee is male cup is neutral milk is feminine table neutral chair feminine can be fun
and think about andorre and monaco they have no definite article whereas lichtenstein has one le i even think that irlande ending with an e is masculine lirlande est soucieux de and not soucieuse or maybe not maybe nobody even knows what irlande is french has always liked to play with language and when you are playing you behave like a child you do whatever crosses your mind crazy or not but with as much seriousnesse as children playing
one radical solution is eliminate masculine and feminine forms altogether
you never stop to amaze me darling really how about you get a life
is there an inherent advantage in gender neutrality easier to learn

the french academy officially got rid of the a couple of years ago so technically sur is now correct
nous choisissons les saucisson
 just to take one example you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled no such luck with english well why are verre ver vers vert and vair all pronounced exactly the same in standard french then just to take one notorious example of a very common phenomenon in french and it is sometimes very difficult for a nonnativespeaker to know whether to pronounce a consonant at the end of a french word or not particularly s but sometimes t or other letters
for sure its bien sûr
at least there is a rule countries that end with an e are feminine otherwise masculine for everything else its arbitrary and i dont have a slot in my brain for remembering them
yes seriously what did you have in mind
in contractual practice this is normally covered in the general notes or preambles where a word or term takes the masculine form it shall be understood to also cover the feminine form or viceversa or something to that effect in fairness to our american friends they have done far better in conciseness and in generating a phase which causes titters among the unders
brilliant view true
dont ask me because i dont know why but its like that and thats the way it is
then dont try triplegendered languages like german or polish
shall i point out her primitive error or will you
whats wrong with a language having masculine and feminine forms is there an inherent advantage in gender neutrality should we have kings and female kings queens and male queens or merely a monarch what will become of male princess charles when he succeeds to the throne
what do you mean it isnt even getting any coverage in france it is getting massive coverage in france i live here and im reading articles about it every day and they are even going to introduce new azerty keyboards with a raised fullstop like this so people can write acteursrices and similar inanities
this will certainly change when china takes over the relevant countries
non les suisses disent huitante
yeah coz women who dont agree with you are not sane or well adjusted harpies and lilliths well get you yet
should france embrace genderneutral words but surely the suggested forms rejected by the academy are not genderneutral but attempt to be genderinclusive in anglophone countries the tendency is to include everyone male female transgender genderfluid etc by having just one genderneutral form the rejection of the word actress in favour of actor by certain media is an example in france and in germany however the trend is in the opposite direction rather than use words which grammatically speaking already include everyone the growing requirement is to mention both masculine and feminine forms in spech and to use some abbreviation thereof in writing thus in german der student is a male student die studentin is a female student die studentinnen are plural female students but die studenten can be a maleonly or a mixed group but woe betide the public speaker or politician who addresses a mixed group od students as studenten no no the speaker must say stundentinnen und studenten tramdrivers must be addressed as straßenbahnfahrerinnen und straßenbahnfahrer and so on because this is cumbersome enough to say out loud but even more cumbersome to write various written forms such as studentinnen or straßenbahnfahrerinnen have been invented all this is in contrast to the simple grammatically correct inclusive plural which already exists thus whilst the english approach is to be genderneutral by using genderunspecific forms the french and german approach is to attempt to be genderinclusive by mentioning both male and female genders even if grammatically superfluous
jai posé une question
what does james t kirk have in common with a toilet roll they both wipe out klingons
you have musnderstood the fact that as the example of a table fem a penis verge bite fem or a vagina vagin masc show linguistic gender has nothing to do with sex they are called masculine and feminine but they might as well be called up and down for all the link it has to their nature as a brit with  years living in france id say that it may matter in english and probably other languages i dont know where gender only refers to sex but in french its a nonsense
when watching all the breastbeating about identity politics is ruining life and inclusive language is destroying our culture by the metric martyrs i have often wondered what would happen when inclusive language met genuinely strongly gendered languages like french or hindi urdu its quite funny to watch actually i am reasonably confident that despite the academys wailing and gnashing of teeth nongendered language will eventually take over
le petomaine is that le pétomane with ptomaine poisoning

just eliminating grammatical gender markings altogether is impossible itd be like banning the determiner the or the verb have in english even english retains the pronouns he she to mark natural gender but german does a similar thing to what the academy is complaining about for gendered groups a group of students can either be studentinnen feminine plural or studenten masculine plural its no big deal there
le shilly et la shally but these days les shéellys
thats a us thing as far as im aware latinoa isnt actually used in latin america
this article misses another connected question which is the gender of positions i know a big french corporation where female executives having the position of directors split in  groups directrices and directeurs the ones who prefer the masculine noun think that their position is weakened if feminine in some fields like diplomacy the feminine ambassadrice presumably refers to the spouse of the ambassadeur
in greek all those words except provlima are feminine which is neutral but mousiki and grammatiki end in etagreek can drive you nuts if you dont know if a word ends in eta or iota ill hever get the articles right

just to take one example you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled no such luck with english seriously
i cant think of anything more stupid than thinking that a table is feminine and a haricot bean is masculine yet the french apparently are content the gender madness of the french language put me off bothering to learn it properly i havent suffered
not specifically french same in all romance languages french spanish italian etc words in these languages inherited their gender from latin and despite the evolution and transformation they went through their gender went unchanged why one gender and not the other for each word just ask the romans
as are septante and octante
you are right they have to define even though it is not required as if nobody could possibly know whom they are referring to if they dont use the definite article i think it is a weakness
what do you call someone who speaks two languages bilingual three trilingual just one language british or us american to be fair almost everyone who knows a second language knows a very useful second language normally english or perhaps a language thats relevant to their location if you already speak english and you live among people who speak english theres little need to learn another language i love languages myself and hope everyone gets the chance to learn more of them but the benefits of learning english are generally much greater than learning any other language and few people learn languages for any reason other than for their own benefit as a british person my language allows me to communicate with over a billion people around the world no other language comes close there are about as many chinese speakers but they all live in china and few speak chinese as a second language
touchez pas au grisbi
since half the words in the english language are of french origin i fail to see how you can describe it as primitiveprimitive definition relating to denoting or preserving the character of an early stage in the evolutionary or historical development of something
if you think that english gets along pretty well without masculine and feminine forms then clearly you havent been paying attention when speaking reading or listening to the language and youve never had to parse a sentence for some reason the guardian persists with the ludicrous campaign to insist that the word actor covers both genders thereby leading to idiocies such as its a gendered word description of virna lisi in her a gendered word obituary here as a female actor but just about everybody else recognises the futility of such things and indeed the proper comparison for such futility should be drawn with lacadémie française the pot calling the kettle black in any case this is all rendered even more irrelevant by the increasingly widespread practice of speakers and writers of french and italian and spanish using both the feminine and masculine plurals together to indicate mixed collectivities which makes a lot more sense than inventing new gender neutral words
 just to take one example you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled no such luck with english its the same in spanish but there is a downside my experience is that spanish speakers have a way of expecting words to be pronounced in a specific way deviations from this are just not understood in a different way we seem to expect english speakers to mangle the language and are more forgiving in terms of trying to understand what someone is trying to say
its interesting that part of this push involves inventing feminine forms for the job descriptions which are traditionally masculine even if a woman is employed whereas english is going the other way and getting rid of the feminine form eg actress
even how you say hi or thanks varies if youre male or female anything else adjectives and nouns are gender neutral unlike in latin languages
touchée
i would imagine that they are but were all grown ups and can even write fuck in english on here if we like
english does have the subjunctive and it is imperitive that it be used as often as possible oh the joy of pontificating on grammar while not knowing how to spell imperative
so an apostrophe used in a plural is right if you do it deliberately and it is correct to use either gender in an arbitrary fashion
the only error i could see was the use of what looked like a superfluous snippet of what might have been intended to be a reflexive when referring to washing the cup some french use of reflexive is odd to english speakers but the one chosen is not a good example which does to constitute the majority of the points raised being in error and indeed the point was valid but the example was wrong the french use of double negatives is one of the key challenges for early learners of each others languages fren and that doesnt mean the ne pas combination it is in constructions such as i have never not gone there some nice simple examples here httpswwwthoughtcocomfrenchdoublenegatives and the difference in approach between french possessive pronouns agreeing in gender with the object whereas in english they agree with the subject is indeed probably the reason why french people with a poor grasp of english may try to carry the gender of the french pronoun over to english i assume that you will concede that son is the masculine possessive pronoun for example
but what gives you the right to say that their differences are grammatical errors its not an error if they do it on purpose they just do it differently in order for something to be an error there first has to be something else that is correct you can judge it against how do you know that you arent the one making the error you make it sound like they used to speak the same french you do and then changed it to make it worse in reality theyve changed their french much less than france has over the past  years
do you know why there is the circumflex accent in french it is just to delete the s in a word example at the middle age we used to write forest transformed in forêt bastard in bâtard words which are remainded exactly in the french script in the english language
thats like saying we should talk in millimetres all the time because kilometres are less precise precision is something to strive for the appropriate amount of for the context that seems to support the idea that identifying the actor as a man or woman by the correct noun is appropriate

i think it would be arrogant to say that québécois dont speak french well mark you appear to know more than the average about romance languages and can therefore presumably speak some if you do have sufficient familiarity with french i suggest that you should try either speeding with or exchanging written communications with quebecois amp then you can judge for yourself you only have to read their newspapers for example like the aussies who persist in putting an apostrophe before a plural s except for a wide range of grammatical errors and i have to say that aussie english is not a hell of a lot better although they only have to deal with one language rather than the two in quebec

no im referring to substandard grammar narrow vocabulary huge levels of substitution of english or i suppose american words the gender uncertainty as mentioned tongue in cheek by the person above and this tends to be both their english and french i suspect that grammar and quality of language are relatively low priorities in a country that turns out excellent mining and engineering grads
how long ago should creepy behaviour be to be ok in your books i think that a proportionate and sensible response is required and an end to the hypocrisy that fawns on media personalities people hang on their every word as if they knew something about climate or the environment or child welfare or whatever even if they dont have two braincells to rub together but then you find that they made a lewd suggestion  years ago when they were maybe not much more than a teenager themselves and suddenly they are a pariah lets go back to just enjoying how they act or whatever else they do to be famous on the media and lets on the one hand not make them up to be superhuman founts of all knowledge and the source of all good wisdom but on the other hand also accept that they may have transgressed at some point in the past whether it be telling sexist and racist jokes or attempting to fondle some young lady or young man and the longer ago it was i guess the more lightly i would be inclined to treat it if you are really concerned about being taken advantage of i suggest that you should do something about your bank your insurance company your supermarket and your employer in comparison touching of your knee in an undesirable manner is pretty trivial however high up it might come in the pc manual
oh youve no idea how far this has gone the regressive left vs the progressive left are simultaneously arguing that there is no gender not a biological one anyway and that there are an infinite number of socially constructed genders that everybody else needs to recognise i think new york city lists  or so witness whats happening in ontario with legislation that can charge you with hate speech for refusing to use a new set of compelled language transgender pronouns i dont agree with jordan petersons view on many things but thank goodness he has brought these issues to light this is not a transgender issue as such this is about state control and thought policing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnytzfbiinu

obviously by any cursory reading
one radical solution of course is for members of the academy to become reformers rather than reactionaries and eliminate masculine and feminine forms altogether plenty of languages including english turkish or thai get along perfectly well without them why dont you worry about actually worry about making poor and vulnerable people materially better off many of whom are women rather than indulging your bourgeois sensitivity in some abstract reinvention of french to fit into your ideological positions on sex and gender languages are always impure they borrow blend and innovate without any loss of expressive power and yet this is precisely what youre railing against you want the authorities onhigh to approve of some slipshod impractical form of prose because it fits into your political worldview sorry if we dont all find it offensive to use the masculine form as the neutral form as weve done for hundreds of years
it all started with latin having  gendersand languages in w europe shedding the neuter except german for oneso mostly its  genders tells you something about the cultures maybeand makes for work in learning the language especially with words agreeing in genderbut vive la difference one thing that intrigues me is that german retained the strongest latin structureand doesnt sound like a romance language more anglosaxon words butgrammar syntax and verb at the end

sorry that was silly of me more haste less speed luckily allargando saw my comment and replied to me
arent phrasal verbs fab nothing better to confuse learners
i think it would be arrogant to say that québécois dont speak french well their french is different from modern metropolitan french because it retains older dialect forms youre assuming that your french is the good french when i bet the québécois speak a more original dialect how can your french be better than quebec french when their version is older and more original
im sure the people of french canada find the way they speak french perfectly satisfactory stupid stereotypes about quebecois are no more acceptable than stupid stereotypes about americans or french people
you sound irritated and bothered by the french you are not alone about that and i can easily understand your feeling but try to see the whole thing the other way a french being very surprised to see some english peculiarities does not the way you look at other languages depend on the language you start from for exemple french in xviith century used to say about english exactly what you are saying now about french not clear complicated too many words having same meaning not precise etci am always amused when i see all the irritation the french are causing all around the world it is very strange and due as well to the french as to other people

arabic has changed a great deal over the years moroccan arabic and gulf arabic are almost mutually unintelligible
apologies to euphobia it was meant for you son panier et son parapluie arent his they are hers assuming mère lapin is woman nepas isnt a double negative would you say je me lave sa tasse
no arabic has separate forms of you for male and female plus all the grammatical masculine and feminine pseudoproblems which some journalists and critics seem to find in french as for the religious element of course youre right arabic is in the traditional view literally the word of god so the text cant be tampered with nor have translations though a useful aid any religious validity
son panier et son parapluie arent his they are hers assuming mère lapin is woman nepas isnt a double negative would you say je me lave sa tasse
its a greek word that probably travelled through latin to other languages sure but you were contradicting someone who had said that spanish problema came from latin it almost certainly did come from latin so your contradiction was out of place you might have given the additional information that the latin word came from greek now where did greek get it from i am sorry but my familiar sources do not go that far back and i am not going to start googling that now
the very amiable french working at st pancras international do though
another equally disgraceful example is the manta ray presumably named by the same patriarchal marine zoologist as the manatee and the portuguese man o war womantaray now
eg mere lapin prend son panier et son parapluie translates literally as mother rabbit takes his basket and his umbrella literally actually son and sa agree with the grammatical gender of the thing possessed not with the gender of the owner thats the way french works whether or not you prefer his and her as i do myself
i can understand why language reform in say arabic or farsi not to mention dari or pashto might effect important social change but hardly in french but this is not gender you are referring to i guess you are referring to the extent to which religion is profoundly impregnated in at least arabic and whats more the importance of the original form of the koran is such that this is not likely to change anytime soon and therefore not the underlying thinking either

no one contradicted that point
thanks for the support
nearly everything you say is incorrect which bit please
i agree its descriptive thats a good thing its a monumental act of scholarship and thats what gives it authority and no other eng lang dictionary around any ponds has more authority
is there really a need to change a whole language over it seriously
clear that the writer knows no thai even how you say hi or thanks varies if youre male or female nouns arent gendered but its a lousy example
if as much attention were paid in france to economic issues as to needless language reform im pretty sure they would have near zero unemployment i can understand why language reform in say arabic or farsi not to mention dari or pashto might effect important social change but hardly in french
its also worth pointing out that the fluidity of english is what has helped make it such a successful and dynamic language the french academy is a stultifying influence in my view and ultimately futile snobbery leave language to users
bonsoir euphobia would there be a clue in your name nearly everything you say is incorrect hows brexit i guess the french would be les françaises nest pas nest pas is french for innit but you know that already
were it only so
be that as it may language still develops according to the way people use it the academy may have power but its not ultimate because lang doesnt work that way

sometimes liberal thinking is like the weather in iceland wait fifteen minutes and itll be different 
lets face it the french have a very funny way of expressing themselves almost impossible to get the hang of to those who speak english when one looks at what the french say in english it becomes very obvious why it is so difficult to translate one has to take a deep breath and guess eg mere lapin prend son panier et son parapluie translates literally as mother rabbit takes his basket and his umbrella all those double negatives i not there go not and and all those i myself wash her cup and some countries are his countries and some her countries oh it is no wonder we english speakers dont get it and sometimes i think neither do the french i mean it is she france and he french why bother to make the effort the french want to practise their english anyway except at railway stationsat railway stations i have discovered nobody speaks english
in greek forin stuff usually ends up neutral
precisely and most of the time the gender of the person is irrelevant when it is relevant we have adjectives to enable it
you are very generous or tolerant to refer to quebecois as french and the alternation of gender is probably arbitrary reflecting the general quality of the language users unlike switzerland where they make a reasonably good job of speaking usually at least two languages the quebecois of my acquaintance dont master either english or french at all well
its not precision if its an irrelevant distinction
im confident that no one can predict how languages will evolve because their evolution is predicated on the way society develops and whatever lang user needs arise
exactly if language made such a difference turkey would be a gender equality paradise
still
venga mark is not the subjunctive youre saying come on mark that is the second person formal imperative mood not the subjunctive mood it just happens that the second person imperative formal is conjugated the same way in spanish as the third person present subjunctive
the indoctrination of standard grammar and orthography is very strong in shools in france and people show a lot of pride in getting it right ie doing what the af suggest in some cases usage diverges and swamps their recommendation but there is a lot of tacit support for their work
unless youre a member of a subscribing library the oed is not available free online its private property
you havent understood what gender means grammatically which makes your attempt at a joke rebound on you
no it doesnt english has complex sentence structure and syntax at higher levels that make it hard to learn well
english does have the subjunctive and it is imperitive that it be used as often as possible
i am pretty certain that inclusive language that refuses to use the masculine and claim it imports the feminine will go when it comes to talking of people once the collective forms as mentioned in this article go in this way it will be an open question as to whether or not they need to be retained for other nouns that use the same gender system whether or not they are actually considered masculine or feminine if it simplifies matters to neuter their gender then once the precedent regarding human groups is set it may not be the matter of more than a generation or two before the entire edifice is scrapped
another way of handling this language dilemma is to alternate genders and this is sometimes practiced in canada in both english and french so using the mps as an example an article describing their work might use the feminine in the first few paragraphs then the masculine in the next few paragraphs etc it may sound awkward as i am describing here but a good writer or editor can ensure that such a text is very readable and unambiguous and respectfully inclusive at the same time
the adjectives get complicated though nouveauxlles
but not to the degree that the french academy is the french academy is prescriptive englishlanguage dictionaries are generally descriptive including the oed there are also other respected englishlanguage dictionaries available
venga mark in spanish the subjunctive very frequently doesnt follow a verb of desire
i think that example shows brilliantly why the af have got it right on this one
typing anything on a french keyboard layout is slow its bonkers
i think the oed is pretty authoritative
no some nouns have endings that seem to but is this accidental or on purpose
i hope an asteroid hits the earth soon
youve lost me
just to reinforce a point already made for those who may not have understood the word in french that is used to apply to any person is feminine la personne and la personne applies equally if the person being described is male female or would like to be identified by one or more alternative genders do lets not have a crusade to try to achieve some sort of bizarre equality by trying to remove gender from language it is bad enough that actors whose acting performance i admire are now condemned to purgatory because they may or may not have touched someones knee  or  years ago let alone having to struggle with chairpersons and hupersons in other languages there is nothing wrong with gender you really have to worry about the people who would like to pretend it either does not exist or who invent arbitrary additional ones and diversity is something to be encouraged lets all take the time to appreciate the differences between us all rather than attack people for recognising those differences
thats like saying we should talk in millimetres all the time because kilometres are less precise precision is something to strive for the appropriate amount of for the context not something to strive for for its own sake
so refreshing to see the people who brushed off incidents sexual assaults and rape faced by thousands of women in europe are outraged by words in the dictionary
actually something far more serious and threatening is happening not only is it happening the guardian pretty much made it try to disappear and then when finally their journalists were forced to talk about it the results were pathetic a gift for xenophobes this is the attitude of the regressive left to the mass assault of women and this is why these articles ring so hollowand as for cameron he is providing english classes to women that need to learn the language hardly nothing
the oed was famously created with definitions on historical principles previous dictionaries had been based on an unscholarly what the lexicographer thought approach examples are dated to show what usage was and when the oed was and still is an immense advance in the scientific study of language it should not be seen as prescriptive certainly the oed should check their exemplification of rabid in the light of complaints but if their review shows its a fair example they should stick with it

thank fuck for that ive long been intrigued by the fact that the fword can be a euphemism for the deity ffs
but to an extent every single one of those with the exception perhaps of skirtchaser which is in any case worn as a badge of honour by some men was originally coined as a criticism or insult directed at a specific behaviour type and the person or people who showed it whereas and whether or not you agree with the overall tone of the piece i confess i largely do but i see many here dont i think this is the central point of interest each of the words in the article was not coined for that purpose and became a word to denigrate over time pointing to a systemic not necessarily deliberate mind process in which words for or describing women become progressively more negative whereas it seems fewer words for or describing men do so like i say im not saying you have to love the piece or agree with every single bit of it but thats pretty interesting and the words you have chosen seem to indirectly strengthen rather than weaken that premise all quite interesting i think if nothing else
nice one brad
they already are judging by reports this week its also pretty telling that stuff like this rarely makes it into print
oh dear the female manager of a brothel is a brothel manageress in simple english i despair of the graun and its writers i really do
there is perhaps some annoyance for men that they dont have complete control of the commodity they want most sex control of sex was actually the prerogative of the church they didnt want to be spending money on supporting illegitimate children in the parish the policy of the church was no sex before marriage sluts and studs a concept devised in the s by academic feminists mainly to justify their own promiscuity promiscuous female sexually liberatedpromiscuous male scumbag cheater love rat etc slut from slattern keeper of a dirty or untidy house stud back handed compliment that reduces a human being to the level of a breeding animal with only one function

it would be great if you could film the reactions of the people around you when he does
not at all more of the fact that origin of language can create such a storm in a teacup and by that logic a clickbait article
i mean congratulations on making a comment that actually refers to the article in a way that makes it clear you read it thats something that is in short supply elsewhere on this thread
policing by whom who cares just because you dont like it doesnt mean its wrong its a perfectly apt description of many feminist commentators
tart bardashingleninglepathiccatamite the male variety of course
im really struggling to understand the point of this article yes there are words in the dictionary that are used specifically to refer to women in negative terms there are also words in the dictionary that are used specifically to refer to men in negative terms there are also words in the dictionary that are used specifically to refer to women in positive terms do we know if there are more negative words for women than men are there more positive words for women than men has the author done any research whatsoever is the existence of any word that is used to specifically refer to one gender evidence of sexism against women
in what sense does this article attack the readership of the guardian
no shes not she was slightly more condemnatory of the rabid feminist example than this article which is careful to point out that its the world thats sexist not the dictionary but she still wasnt suggesting anything as fatuous as you are accusing her of
no but apparently its very recent there is a guardian columnist called something slapper who wrote in one of her columns that not so long ago a slapper used to mean a sparky courageous woman
hamster a female pork butcher lobster a female underarm bowler 
rodders you tart del boy
yeah very much so not only does this free sex dilute the power of the mother of the children but also potentially luring the man and breadwinner away leaving that family desolate i guess there is also the transmission of sexual diseases to think ofand before we really understood the causes of stds the fact fallen women would often have them must have coloured perception of them
if someone is overzealously obsessive in their adherence to any political doctrine group or attitude then people may well use the adjective rabid when describing it this isnt policing this is one persons interpretation of an incident or an argument moreover the usage of this adjective isnt exclusive to feminism it exists in a vacuum away from feminism it certainly isnt policing to believe someone somewhere might feel they can use it in association with feminism policing would be to actively announce that the use of a pejorative adjective next to feminism is unacceptable this kind of cranky behaviour see what i did there is that unacceptable is quite likely to make people shake their heads and wonder why mainstream feminism has turned into a quasifascistic cause whose main focus is things like ensuring critical or disparaging adjectives dont appear near the word feminism
goodness me the lengths to which some people will go to prove their own personal prejudices as fact the meanings of words are not changed by order of the male dominated ruling class they evolve as a result of common usage by common people both male and female there is no sexist agenda going on here for a far more informed explanation of how words and phrases evolve over time i would recommend that people watch susie dents origins of words segment every weekday on countdown
i could be wrong but i think its not just about derogatory terms but how terms that originally denoted a position of power or authority for a women later came to signify a women of ill repute i dont know it certainly rustled a few jimmies though which is always entertaining
thats true nobody would advertise a spinster pad
such blatant lies and you are a contributor most people now know only the radical farleft men hating feminists are given the oxygen of publicity as somehow they are supposed to represent the views of mainstream society when nothing could be further from the truth feminists always shut down debate when it suits them get people fired from their jobs who disagree with them and turn a blind eye to the real rape culture in rd world nations feminism is a total and utter sham and should be renamed to antieuropeanism

you know if i published a daily paper and this many readers were telling me what i was printing was shit id have a rethink do you not think youre alienating a lot of readers attacking your readership is unbelievably toxic as theyll just move on
its the thinking that needs changing not the language in other words as the author says in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world and at no point does he say anything to support the rest of criticisms did you perhaps read the headline and not the article
you are adam boyle and i claim my 
great point because i havent seen anything in the guardian criticising the other kinds of mistreatment of women not once were lucky to have your sharpeyed no nonsense analysis ian godspeed
anyone know where the word slapper as in a loose woman came from
one article that reveals the vacuum at the heart of the guardian more like
tart collins dictionary says that this is a thcentury contraction of sweetheart a term of endearment particularly to women from  however it is attested as meaning a female of immoral character a prostitute from the mid s onwards it is a common descriptive term for rodney trotter
or indeed a cock
it was only when my children went to school that i realised that bossy among children was applied exclusively to girls really i knew that was the standard assertion in the guardian but ive never seen it in real life in my experience its generally applied to anyone who tries to tell others what to do and micromanage their actions whether thats a man woman or child
this is a thcentury contraction of sweetheart i didnt know tart had such a lovely origin im going to reclaim it and encourage my husband to call me a tart in public

including you who wishes to ban political correctness by which term you seem to mean not just using language to offend people
i suppose historically where a woman was dependent upon a man for survival and the only thing she had to offer in return for that was sex and children a woman giving sex away for nothing or little was a threat to the well being of others
the writer says sexist assumptions find their way into speech and writing for the simple reason that society is still sexist which suggests to me hed agree with you
nope as the meaning is obviously a mix of the two terms however the most obvious use of rabid is with dog personally i dont have a problem with rabid feminists as some of them really are worthy of that descriptive
no need its referred to in nearly every btl discussion
its absurd selectively is becoming pravda meanwhile in sweden denmark and germany nothing has happened 
in this age of rampant political correctness wait wait i cant go on ive just noticed rampant is an anagram of man part this is clearly sexist and degrading when used as an adjective in any sentence that might be read by a woman in fact i humbly apologise to all woman who have read this and i apologise again for using the word woman i feel quite sure i have broken some rule here
yeah no absolutely well done for pointing out there are other things happening too while reading this article id completely forgotten that must try harder also what exactly has cameron done to help standing up and criticising people isnt the same as helping them you know
eh

get in the memory hole you thought criminalwere trying to get on with our  minutes hate
how do those  words reveal sexism because they are no longer the same as their origins there are thousands of english words that no longer mean the same as their origins and have passed into common usage i heard recently that a man calling a woman other than his partner darling sweetheart or honey was sexist and demeaning however on my walk to work every morning i am greeted by a woman i pass as she takes her daughter to school she always smiles and says hello darling and i always reply good morning it seems terribly british i know but we dont even know each other other than that hello as we pass each day in local café where i go for my full english breakfast on a saturday morning hangover cure the waitress calls me sweetheart i dont take offence and when im asked to be a honey and pass something down from the top shelf in the supermarket i just assume the lady is being polite so why would it be deemed sexist if i were to use those terms to a stranger is it because they used to be sexist years ago does it still apply

 likes for this but no proof provided can you direct me to at least one article that actually does this that is attacks progressive muslims if possible the links to the articles so i can judge from the context of the articles whether he is in fact attacking them they may exist but i think some evidence is required under the circumstances
gender differences are real but not as real as some would have it having a womb does not make a person incapable of running a company or being the boss or running the line at a premiership football game we should only care about gender differences when they are relevant and not as the pcgonemad crew would like to assign all sorts of things to gender
i remember hearing on radio  many years ago about the word silly morphing from meaning blessed holy and pious via being naively so even willing to go to the stake to its main modern meaning of ignorance feeblemindedness and foolish behaviour seemingly it derives from the old english sǣliġseely meaning blessedblissful see here and here
the author isnt actually arguing that there is a problem with derogatory words or that they should be abolished
there is perhaps some annoyance for men that they dont have complete control of the commodity they want most sexthat contributes to this regrettable tendency to invent nasty names also i guess the consequences of sexual behaviour have for most of history had a very different outcome for women than men mens bodies dont have the testament of a pregnancy to betray them the intragender attitudes to promiscuity are also quite interesting a man who is sexually successful tends to often be envied by other men is the same true of women often it seems to me they are particularly harsh on female promiscuity although thankfully this seems to be changing
unlikely they werent allowed to act on stage until after the restoration so some  years later
this mirror isnt showing us anything good though its showing us that society has found a myriad ways to insult and judge women by making even ordinary descriptors derogatory quite sinister nasty but sadly unsurprising

how can you possibly have read this article with multiple references to words that were genderequal in the medieval period but become misogynistic in the modern or looked at the islamic world with extraordinary freedoms in the medieval period only matched by appalling oppressions now and concluded that misogyny and repression is medieval

you can say the same about paedophilia right its only a problem if youre looking at it if you mean child abuse then its a wee bit easier to discern the intent of the perpetrator if you catch them in the act of doing nasty things to a child sexism and racism remain very often a matter of interpretation was that person using a common turn of phrase or was it a micro aggression the two arent really comparable
i loath the word except in the joan collins in padded shoulders sense and as a verb
it has morphed in to biatch which is much more satisfying
such a term may have been acceptable once but is it nowin this context absolutelyi always take the term used in that way to mean strong confident woman who is too magnificent to be constrained by pettybourgeois morality

well if the cap fits however those of us living in the real world as opposed to a ideology driven fantasy world know that it is a word that is mainly used by women to insult other women
well if the cap fits however those of us living in the real world as opposed to a ideology driven fantasy world know that it is a word that is mainly used by women to insult other womenor themselvessometimes if a woman has put you down and wants you to be  certain that it was a put down she will add im such a bitch on the end
if being a strong assertive woman is viewed by others as being bitchy so be it better to be a bitch than a doormat
but isnt bitchiness all about pulling up the drawbridge behind you or prising other womens fingers off the last liferaft to put it another way its not the strong assertiveness which attracts criticism but the selfcentrednessid never heard of skank by the way

it depends how its used and by whom its not often a man can get away with using it unless its for another man or himself
promiscuity does have taboo for men well for me anyway i have several men friends of the single bedhopping variety who are often jokingly called slags or tarts by our friends because they are
last argument i had with our unpleasant neighbours they called me a prick now if i was a bloke fine but it really dosnt work if you throw it at a woman same with tosser wanker or bastard most insults are gendered and theres plenty for both sexes knobhead is fairly neutral and you just cant beat a good old fcking idiot im certainly not going to restrict my choice in insults for ideological reasons on the list of things to concern myself with its not even at the bottom in fact its so low i cant even be bothered to get the pen out to add it
theres a certain magnifience about being a bitch as illustrated by joan collins and stephanie beacham most other insults aimed at women emphasise either dirtiness or subservience
i think there are two different uses to this insult making a bitchy comment or having a bitch about someone is fairly commonplace and i dont feel particularly offended by the word in those contexts but when an ambitious careerfocused woman is called a bitch where a man would just be called well ambitious thats another issue altogether

phil jupiter once described a mark lamarr putdown of a woman as just being a bitchslap it was on some radio showjupitus doesnt strike me as a malicious person doesnt strike me as funny either but thats by the by but i cringed when i heard that its wrong on about every level you can think of

if i remember rightly alexis carrington colby dexter and sable colby would seldom be referred to as simply a bitch in the papers they were usually a superbitch but whatever you called them they were definitely bitchin as they say in the vernacular
an article like this serves to indicate how detached from the real world some people in newspaper land really are i gather from the article that the writer is more or less objecting to men referring to a woman as a bitch in reality a man is much more likely to refer to a woman as a dog in terms of an insult anyone who does not know this must move in very limited circles indeed
misogyny reigns and is gaining new ground day by day in this profoundly womanhating culture regardless of valiant efforts to try and read some positive aspects in insults casually hurled at women and internalized regardless of their actual behaviour
while i hate to indulge in whataboutery theres plenty of insults casually hurled at men too as for this being a profoundly woman hating culture its hardly saudi arabia is it
spose it all depends on context and your relationship with the insulters i use swearing banter with people but only if they dont find it offensive and there are no kids presentyou can be offensive and put people down by insinuation and tone of voicei would never though use racist language
from my point of view bitch is more often and more aptly used when describing men who are bitchy the problem here is of course that the connotations are derived from nagging and mean women it is also used in a positive context between friends someone who doesnt take the shit but boomerangs it back to whom it may concern the problem basically is that men and women play by different rules in media and not least on cif a combo of media outlet and social media the hypocrisy about derogatory invectives is the acceptance for example in this paper for terms such as mediawhore wich is often very often posted in comments btl when the article is written by a woman it is no point in reporting it either at worst you will be banned for it and the comment still satys there so the message is clear ie different rules for men and women end ofit can never be used for a man and will certainly be punished if anyone would venture to write it nor bitch of course no im off to read jonathan jones article a man who if a woman would certainly be called a media whore
i meant to say that youll be banned for reporting not if you post it about a woman writer

nobody calls women bitches any more not in headlinesthey do if they are bitches because that is the point the word bitch outside the small but vocal subculture dialect of us hiphop english is not taken to mean all women feminist commentators constantly try and claim it is equivalent to nigger or whatever but this is a false equivalent nigger means all black people are inferior that is why it is without exception a bad word bitch means this particular woman is behaving in an unpleasant way which is why sometimes it is appropriate because sometimes women do behave in unpleasant ways it is no more sexist than bastard which is only ever used to describe men is sexist
from a psychological point of view one of the reasons we name things is to make them manageable to lessen our fear and give us power over both the objectproblem and the concept behind it the fact that women have so many words created to describe them is an interesting comment on mens historical fear of a womans strength and influence from that perspective i suppose you could take this as a compliment ha
nagging doubt
i am not going to say that the gist of this is unimportant still less untrue language is important however i picked up on the fact that six of the eight words used are pretty archaic they are not quite chaucerian but they belong to a world where posh spice would have been called mrs david beckham as for mistress and tart yeah i do hear those words reasonably often although the latter is often a term close female friends use to each other interestingly spinster is an extremely oldfashioned term how many unmarried women reading this can say they have ever been referred to as such however bachelor implies to my mind less connatations of power and more mild homophobia maybe spinster is occasionally synonymous with gay woman but i think that connection is quite faint if it exists at all

it takes ages to write a dictionary
i hope that perhaps spinster can be rehabilitated but the connotation of spinster for me is an unmarried woman left on the shelf a bachelor an unmarried man enjoying himself before marriage phrases that spring to mind are embittered spinster and gay bachelor
nagging question
you missed the other  and wench is still used derogatorily although going out of use courtesan while not in common everyday use is still used in literature with the meaning described in the article
cavemanonce meant an early human or closely related species popularly held to reside in caves now also used to refer to a man with old fashioned or backward opinions particularly with regard to women
im obviously entirely out of date rabid dog
some are just forgotten like baxter or bakster from bakester meaning a female baker webster a female weaver
so people in the th and much of the th century were sexist and
i dont object to them putting something like offensive against certain words they already do
just when you think weve reached peak guardian we hit a higher peak guardian first of all last weeks pitiful and selfrighteous drivel about virtue signalling now this waste of bandwidth it really is about time that the author found something useful to do with his time maybe writing about something that matters
you missed out strumpet which derived from strum to play badly on the harpsichord or any other stringed instrument
this is almost certainly true whats lacking in the article is the native perception of the insult one might perceive a feminine insult as being more serious or more severe which then is based on other factors
spinster of this parish in the sense of unmarried woman within the relevant area occurs in the banns for marriage but i cant otherwise remember hearing anyone so described for many years bachelor has likewise largely dropped out of use the confirmed sort are probably excluded from the guardian house style guide
a little racism is natural due to tribalism and a fear of the unknownequality although a nice idea is not viable as we are all different and that what makes the world so interesting id hate it if we were all grey drones repeating the same newspeak and indulging in the same activities
we definitely need a new dictionary with new approved definitions if we can seize the language rid it of superfluous harmful words and amend the definition of the rest we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it
woman reduced to a toxic chemical flavoured breakfast replacement thats taking pejoration to the extreme
but are any of those words actually in general use with those meanings eg i occasionally hear tart used but only for someone of either gender who takes an allegedly excessive interest in their appearance
er the sexism is hardly at the heart of the english language i look forward to hearing back on mr shariatmadaris progress in esperanto over the present term
interesting just as long as nobody want to change the dictionary for political reasons i dont object to them putting something like offensive against certain words not least because those are useful warnings against potential usemisuse but youre right to note that the dictionary reflects usage and doesnt lead or define it
the words highlighted may show a particularly strong form of sexist pejoration but there are other words that do so more subtly it was only when my children went to school that i realised that bossy among children was applied exclusively to girls i do hope however that this observation does not lead to pressure to change the dictionary definitions pressure to ensure that definitions and usages are genuinely prevalent and not the relics of earlier prejudices is entirely proper of course
if you think english is sexist try german
is the argument here that all words referring to women that were either neutral or positive have degraded in some way or simply that words change their meaning over time it seems to me quite likely that david has picked his examples selectively im sure their are as many or more examples of words for men that have become derogatory its particularly interesting how almost all the words for male genitalia have become insults 
also see black market black look blackballed black economy etc although its not so bad to be in the black
i cant agree with the bachelorspinster example i have always thought of both words having the same malefemale meaning without any sexist connotations i certainly dont think bachelor speaks of power and high status
sexism is like racism homophobia or xenophobia you will see it everywhere if that is your intention as this writer plainly intends
should probably just manup and grow a pair
bint is a respectable term in arabic but not in english might be due to soldiers returning from the middle east nuff said also does rampant not collocate with sexism 
you couldnt find any examples that didnt go out of use in the s seriously courtesan wench
 out of 
pop tart
and female insecurity at the heart of its perception
a bit much does etymology freak you out to that extent
examples of exclusively male ones please
youre very unlikely to come across a literally rabid anyone in the uk at least attaching numbers to how many metaphorically rabid feminists there are might be sounds quite hard just how froth flecked do you have to be to be officially and metaphorically rabid that is a bit of a problem so the oed presumably didnt do that experiment but just looked at what was in the corpus but that presents a whole host of problems too the most prominent one being that there is no real way of making a corpus representative rabid kipper is my favourite because its such a funny image
especially seagulling which a guardian journalist claimed was an everyday thing on british university campuses
nope beyond simply a direct descriptive behaving like rabid dogs is a quite common phrase
doxy i like mort is another good one is that young woman your wife said i yes said he after a fashion and then he leered at the lass and she leered at him do you attend any place of worship said i a great many master what place do you chiefly attend  said i the chequers master do they preach the best sermons there  said i no master but they sells the best ale there do you worship ale  said i yes master i worships ale anything else said iyes master i and my mort worships something besides good ale dont we sue and then he leered at the mort who leered at him and both made odd motions backwards and forwards causing the baskets which hung around them to creak and rustle and uttering loud shouts of laughter which roused the echoes of the neighbouring hills
not racism ink
tart is gender neutral these days same with slag and bitch
how feminist is it to strangle language with a political correct corset 
and language is a mirror to society
so here we have another believer in the strong form of the sapirwhorf hypothesis that language determines thought apparently this chap has not noticed that every time some word is banned or whose use is criticised a the replacement term soon catches the connotation or thought of its predecessor look at the history of terms used to describe those less intellectually talented than others starting with cretin and moron through esn etcits the thinking that needs changing not the language
nagging satnag
exactly o the derivation is clear i suppose but i expect there are many people out there who use the expression and have no idea of that for example how many know that blimey comes from the oath god blind me about as many as still use that word i expect
whataboutery
yes isnt it annoying as long as youre never the target of any of these words its easy to shrug celebrating misogyny no thanks
i bet you were one of those that complained about the chris moyles ad as well
what an example of fearless and passionate journalism wherever there are scientists that make selfdepricating jokes those that wear shirts with cartoon space ladies on and now language itself there will be the guardian always ready to fight these great injusticies and rightly so its not as if there is anything else going on around europe that requires the attention of real femininsts im waiting for that next article attacking nasty mr cameron for ironically trying to do more for women in need than all of these collumnists combined
i dont have a copy of the dictionary myself but do hope those fulminating about it have done more than take a few selected examples to make their case what example does the dictionary cite for say thug or murderer are we sure its the dictionary thats biased in its choices and not journalists
obviously some are not willing to consider language as a vivid creative process involving everybody all the time 
it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking 
the confirmed sort are probably excluded from the guardian house style guide that was the euphemism for men who liked other men were light on their feet and a bit too fond of their mothers
thats my gravestone sorted
all those words mean the person is stupid or unpleasant they dont have the sexual sluttish connotation of the words mentioned in the article also they arent words that once denoted authority like the ones in the article
sexism is like racism homophobia or xenophobia you will see it everywhere if that is your intention i am sure this is truei would expect someone who studies a subject to see more than the casual observer that is how academics work having said what you said an approach that is often intended to be derogatory you overlook that he might be right to see it nothing in your post suggests that he is wrong reminds me of a very bad joke how many communists does it take to change a light bulb three one to put the bulb in one to hold the ladder and one to keep an eye on the other two intellectuals we still have a tendency to dislike clever people or people who study at certain times although there are always exceptions to the rule
dont say you actually read the article instead of coming up with a kneejerk comment based on the headline
dont hold your breath
finally another article on this very important issue i dont think it has been discussed ad nauseam at all fortunately this one offers eyeopening insight social conditions leave their mark on the language who would have thought only time will tell what a bold statement
womens rights are being suppressed throughout the world and now there is a growing fear that hard fought rights will be rolled back across europe and the guardians response run an article condemning the origins of arcane words
this sounds like a job application for chief dominatrix of an english version of the academie francaise fine by me so long as its not taxpayer funded an institution which would provide untold comedic delight to the anglosphere but we would need a name for the kind of pathetic virtue signalling male who would volunteer to ingratiate ximself with such an organ wanker tosser twat answers on a postcard please
you cant beat ben johnsons definition of oats a grain which in england is generally given to horses but in scotland supports the people
one must realise that there is never a peak guardian the guardian just is
i challenge you to come up with five words that are the male equivalent of tart
however bachelor implies to my mind less connatations of power and more mild homophobia yes i think thats right compare he never married in an obituary
it is like the recent jcorbyn bashingevery journalist had to prove his loyalty reminds me a bit totalitarian states demanding self critic in front of the public
it was only when my children went to school that i realised that bossy among children was applied exclusively to girls depends on what behaviour you use to define it i suppose officiously telling someone else what to do despite having no authority or business doing so is something ive not personally noticed a boy doing theyre more likely to try and physically coerce you if youre reading this helen yes i do mean you when we were at school together
what would be the word that covers failure to report  sexual attacks how about guardian
bollocks
welcome to politically correct new speak we will soon only be allowed to say something is double plus good or double plus bad
bradley walsh says it every night on the chase
blimey i think even jessica valenti would find this article a bit much
this absurd denigration of english and pc victimizationhunting is almost beyond parody
rogue pirate womanizer skirtchaser pervert etc
actor is a latin masculine noun actresses are always actresses they cannot be actors for anatomical reasons
nagging groin strain
hysteria comes from the greek for womb hysterus
im confused did women get proper representation at the oscars in the th century or not
has there been an official reason given for why the comments for that article are not accessible
 or indeed a cock
grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens hmmm without supporting examples i would say that grating in this sense is either genderneutral or male but more to the point shrill reflects an actual anatomical difference that is a characteristic of men and women womens voices are higher and lighter than mens i cant remember the last time that someone talked about a shrill mans voice this is not sexism it is a reflection of actual gender differences i know it is perhaps not pc but generally it is the women who have the breasts and women who have the equipment to bear children regardless of the wishes of the pc community gender differences are real
fascinating and revealing highlights actual linguistic gender discrimination at the heart of our language refreshingly different from so many feminist articles on the guardian which are long on chest beating and short on substance
dont sit out on the stoop
as the lead picture suggests the english language goes back a long way so it isnt surprising that there is a legacy of a different and bygone era what is more disturbing to me is that there are vast swathes of the world  of humanknd actually where the islamic religion means that not only is the language still reflective of a bygone era misogyny is still fully accepted and practised as normal often in a very medieval and repressive way maybe we could have an article about that some time too
writers producing novels about the thth century french court i expect
as long they feel important diverting away from real social considerations they will remain happy to be unsatisfied 
ban the dictionary
i can and my daughter goes to the local compby jove as evidenced by your use of language spelling and grammar i hazard that you may have attended a rather posh school yourself or are at the very least a credit to the state sector simply marvelous post
man up you lot slow news day
they should have doubled down and stuck to their guns like the protein world lot did with their are you beach body ready poster and the twitter outrage but as you say the moment they apologised they were in trouble
interestingly words tend to change their meaning over time for the benefit of those who claim greater privileges in a society
in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world
as in tarted up used also of houses
in the context of a dog having rabies yes but the dictionary also examples other uses and meanings of words
always check for earlier comments before you post
conservapediacom did the same for the christian right to give an alternative to wikipedia i dont think we want that to happen to language
and nowlet see if all those journalists who are suppose to write an article about discrimination of women in dictionaryare able to spot social discrimination in them 
so our rabbid rightwing government contains a few old onenation conservatives use the oed for endless fun constructing sentences to undermine the press find marginally appropriate words and play with the punctuation to distort the meaning
far more worrying to me though i suppose there might be an innocent explanation is the fact that yesterdays emer otoole piece on the same subject seems to have disappeared below the line could it be because they couldnt attract enough pious contributions agreeing with the writer i commented yesterday that rabid feminist was only one of four examples of that use of rabid shown in the online dictionary whereas all four examples for chauvinist juxtaposed male this seems to me to back up the claim that the examples reflect actual usage rather than editorial bias rabid is often used alongside feminist but is also often used in other contexts chauvinist can be used in other contexts but is now almost exclusively used to describe men with an unwarranted sense of superiority in neither case does the exampleexamples suggest that every member of the group used in the example deserves the description suggested by the adjective although of course there will be rabid feminists who believe all men are male chauvinists and vice versa at a tangent but still relevant i think did anyone hear the gorbals vampire on rextra yesterday tam dalyell can be heard describing s gorbals mp alice cullen as a talisperson of public feeling talk about rewriting the language
i get called a tart all the time im male should i complain also
tart certainly its quite carry onesque
rabid dog as i associate rabid with rabies it should more accurately be rabid bat but thats getting too factual poptart sprang to mind first wench is just an archaic tern for a young woman mistress is contracted to mrs as in a married woman or a female teacher frankly i find this trying to redefine my native language bloody annoying celebrate it for what it is this sexism nonsense should stop we have a beautiful and complex language celebrate it do not denigrate it
ive never heard it used to describe men i must be getting old
dutch courage
a lot of words have taboo slang indication but they are still there a dictionary is like a shapshot or mirror of the language i think who blames a mirror for the shape of ones ears who to blame for connotations its a sort of linguistic politburo for goodness sake
confirmed bachelor used to be obitspeak for homosexual
judging by the comments above this article seems to have hit a nerve male insecurity lies at the heart of misogyny
emer otoole is
 says that if they change the example to rabid capitalist no capitalists will rabidly complain are these people really so lacking in selfawareness
as for nagging and shrill i suspect even most women would acknowledge its a female trait far more than a male we should reinstate the word scold as in sanctimonious scold therer lots of them around
ive heard friends grandmothers in wales ask hows your tart and it was well accepted to be sweetheart and nothing more but i suppose thats a region that has retained the original meaning
what a bell end only a cock would write such stuff dick not you you understand but you get my point
this article is the usual guardian noises one day the guardian will get back to being an adult newspaper
shariatmadari is attempting to draw conclusions from nothing unusual words often change their meaning and are often created bedlam and barmy reflect the names of old asylums bethlehem and barming all languages have derogatory terms for people of whatever sex
rewrite it under approved guidelines
exactly what i thought
philander originally just a lover now a man whos a bit too much of a hit with the ladies
are the pc crowd ever happy
another day another article another author who either hasnt actually read the ation in question or hasnt included it because of how it undermines his point
what sort of backward land are you from sir
however the phrase still a bachelor is a sign of masculine failure
grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens is it possible that this is because they are words that are actually used more often to describe some womens voices there are words that are negative that are more commonly associated with men as well so is the above really a problem with language being sexist in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world why choose feminist over say rightwinger communist or fan though you might have had a point if that was the only example of how the word was used in a sentence but it wasnt they also had democratic and glass collector amongst many others the question is why are you so against it being used to describe certain feminists is it impossible that a feminist might act in that way must feminists only be associated with good things sure its not helpful to use such words in discussions but then again no derogatorypejorative term is that does not mean that we should erase their usage from the dictionary linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men do you have a citation for this claim
as so many others have pointed out this article and all the others that have made the same point in previous days is shooting the messenger the examples given cite every day use they arent ones made up by the dictionarys compilers how about someone trawling through it and coming up with a list of all the examples that could be considered derogatory to men except i doubt that any men would be particularly bothered by them
whats wrong with those terms then
a rabid feminist can be a man if a man can be a feminist
when was governess last used probably in s mills amp boon fiction tart is long gone too even slapper is getting a bit long in the tooth
not to forget my favourite brewster a female brewer used to be a respectable profession for widows probably merry ones
i suppose it depends on the context in which the words are used for example the word virtue means behaviour showing high moral standards whereas the term virtue signalling means something entirely different and worse
manageress isnt a word that should be used anyway the correct term for a female manager is manager in the same way that a female teacher is a teacher one manages the other teaches
good point i meant to be in denial sorry about that having a bad day
also that soap opera staple the tart with a heart as opposed to yer commonorgarden tart who is heartless
and its an insult for black people in german similar to nigger but thats how words work
so one article in the guardian is an insane song and dance is it contrast our outrage over this with our reaction to something like oh i dont know hundreds of women being sexually assaulted in a german city centre and youll see that we have our priorities firmly in order and as a result its clear that a pejorative adjective placed next to the sacrosanct noun feminism lets discuss language shall we who are you including in our outrage im not outraged are you and who is included in our reaction to the sexual assaults are you included and when you say our priorities do you mean your priorities in short do you know what the word our means theres also something missing from that overly long sentence as the last bit tails off rendering it meaningless you seem to have got a bit hot under the collar are you outraged about something
now add the unbiasing side of the article which lists  terms that put men in a bad light
so what are you proposing a form of orwellian newspeak where words would no longer have the meanings previously attributed to them thinking about the male equivalents of some of these words throws their sexism into sharp relief master isnt such a word given the connotations of slavery nor is bachelor which has associations of failure and sadness and being left on the shelf exactly the same as spinster does this article only serves to highlight the blinkered attitude of the author
harlot
most of those words started in the gutter so to speak perhaps banker is an example of perjoration in modern times it is not specifically male thoughit seems to me the words in the article dropped out of use as a consequence of the degradation of their meanings
and yes its not surprising that sexism is embedded in languages other than english but this is an article specifically about the english language not a global survey
words like beauty and elegance are usually used to decribe women feminine is used to describe caring compassion blah blah blah masculine is used to describe violence and agression
i get the article but the word madam is spelt differently to madame is it not so why is the article saying they mean the same thing
foot was the same
noone claimed that because there are words for women that are not used for men does not make a language sexist there have always been derogatory words from both the point about these words is the way their meanings have become more derogatory over time and the comparison with the male equivalents which havent its an interesting albeit minor reflection of sexism in society over the period of that change
what is the feminine equivalent of sir when i address an adult stranger in new york i use formal forms of address like sir and maam a female clerk in a government office thought maam was insulting a sikh man was pleased some sikhs observe a religious obligation to treat all people with equal respect in the us south and west maam is universal help what do i do exaggerated politeness is a common multicultural way of showing respect my wife a writer says the answer is extremely local you just have to do as the locals do
but its real high compared to the comments underneath it
racistnewspikfreudian slip p
spinster is definitely negative would you feel comfortable calling someone a spinster to their face bachelor is neutral or positivewomaniser is a fair parallel to tart but its not really used as an insult just a description if a negative one it is also not a word that was once positive and has degraded in meaning as far as im aware
maybe you should moderate your behavior
gtthe meaning of boy to refer to a juvenile has not changed neither has courtesan lost its meaning to refer to courtesans or mistress to refer to some woman having dozens of servants but that wasnt the point of the article in the first place its never been about a complete shift towards an insultthe fact that you are trying so hard to sound reasonable but then sound like a little boy who didnt get what he wanted the fact that you write keep trying yet dont see how it is inducing fremdscham to others is really painful to watch but hey in your words keep trying
and to some people wayne rooney gilf is as well
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language you could do an article like this with every language in the world but unfortunately for you there are no other languages none at all that are as gender neutral in its fundaments as english no gender for objects is the most glaring example the use of theytheirthem as a gender neutral pronoun is another sorry to make this point as obviously the intention of the guardian is a nice bit of selfhatred and to attack english speakers but there it is
twis
you mean the mound that peter pieter plugged with his finger
says our man in dubai
the male forms all being about power prestige and respect while the female forms are all about lies deceit and sex is indeed sad
its an appealing thesis at first sight but it doesnt really stand up to scrutiny many of todays pejorative terms once had entirely innocent meanings knave originally meant a male domestic servant a cad took fares you say that a look at the male forms tells its own story but that really only applies to the special case of mistress and the very much outmoded governess courtier has become even more archaic than its female equivalent madam is still the polite partner to sir to suggest thats not its most common meaning is a stretch wench and hussy have all fallen out of usage and spinster isnt far behind and bachelor has its own connotations as a codeword for gay so while it makes for a diverting article i fear theres little more to it
even the words woman and female imply subservience to the xy chromosome lets face it youre flogging a dead horse mate
seeing as this is a languagedictionarythemed article selfdenial means roughly the same as selfsacrifice is that actually what you meant
tart is still very occasionally used in liverpool for girlfriend though usually ironically now as is judy she seems to be rather more frequent here too than elsewhere often but not always provoking a feline maternal response woman also seems overall to be used more when referring toa woman our family for instance was a fairly typical town centre matriarchy where the boss was the granny called nin in the welsh style nin was tiny but always deferred to and respected by the men in the family which may possibly have affected the terms used to some extent
others feminists themselves argue that to hold to the principle of gender equalityis to be a feminist though others would argue that men can only be allies either way i think it is the case that both men and women should have an equal voice in the discussion of such things and that people should be free to label themselves as they see fit without other people dictating what is acceptable
if this is even a problem its so minor theres not a worlds tiniest violin small enough to play to go along with iton a side note im sure there are several words like oaf and cad that apply only to malesput away the victim card it doesnt apply here
i think you make some good points there i think though theres still more work to do but were getting there
hyst
have the achievements of the feminist movement percolated down through the many layers of our language how can you say that getting rabid feminist into oxford dictionary is a fine achievement that can be laid at feet of current crop of twittering outragettes
oh my goodness the guardian should send forth the wraiths of the language police to punish those who choose to use the english language whatever its flaws in whatever horrible way they choose many things can be controlled how people choose to use language is not one of them
and again macho any reference to chivalry is seen as tweelad once an innocuous reference to a younger man now used to talk about a potential rapist
well these days feminists instist that anyone that believes in equality has to call themselves a feminist
or because of life choices career choices and hours worked hasnt this pay gap been refuted enough times by now
yes its market forces now
antiherstamine or antionestamine surely
dick has also assumed a new meaning and its far more widespread today than any of the words in the article
so what would you like us to do about it
exactly so pedophilia cases are normslly accompanied by or comprised of testimonies actual specific harm medical reports and a range of evidence subject to the burden of proof
good one slits wrists
really
gay
wombmyn i feel sick
it does you cant rush it for example noah webster who wrote the dictionary for the usa in the th century rushed it and it was published with hundreds of spelling errors
or a boris
but you have to show which comes first is there something which requires a word to describe it or does the word generate a life and world of its own or is it a twoway street on the casanovatart dichotomy historically it was ever so simple a philandering man not admirable behaviourm let me stress left bastards in someone elses house nightmare for them a similarlybehaved woman brought the bastards into her own house nightmare for her
a strange post i dont remember our society condoning men beating women or women beating men i thought there was a law against it hohum i must be wrong no its the implicit violence in language and behaviour towards women and other targets that sometimes leads to beatings and as men are physically stronger than women in  of cases we know who comes out worse off in  per cent of cases
unfortunately this is probably true of many languages
actor or actress manager or manageress i do believe we are moving away from such gender assigned words and just using the once masculine to encompass everyone well we were until dare i say it some rabid folk raised objectionseven children are accepting of words like mankind and human as gender neutral so why cant some adults see beyond their own prejudicethink about it who is going to lose some perceived status when all the once masculine descriptives become everyones propertyjust like our own english language in ceasing to be our own in an international world that no longer has a barrier to once english jobsas for inventing a new language to level the playing field well esperanto anyoneanyone
interesting article although with the exception of the word mistress i cant remember the last time i heard any of those words being used as part of a serious conversation
milf is a sexy word
what has grown exponentially is regular use is dickhead knobhead bellend legend tool prick wanker jerk and so on so im looking forward to shariatmadaris companion article on the sexist linguistic denigration of men next week yea right i think his point was that the words used to be used respectfully and turned into insults later im not aware of any time in the past when calling somebody a wanker reflected any kind of high status
the e that you made doesnt show is lack of interest or that he hates this newspaper have you actually read what you ed
but is repeatedly said feminism is purely the drive for gender equality so if it that is the case then why cant both genders be feminists
i am not really sure i understand the mandarin part being a native speaker dont we usually just change the pronoun
male version all blokes
well it beats saying well done you hussy
antihistamine has to change to antiwomantamine its simply got to
what has grown exponentially is regular use is dickhead knobhead bellend legend tool prick wanker jerk and so on so im looking forward to shariatmadaris companion article on the sexist linguistic denigration of men next week yea right your vulgar terms of abuse can hardly be equated with the terms referred to by shariatmadari similar vulgar female terms exist and are in common use though one of them probably wont be seen on here
i think you make an interesting point thanks to me part of the problem is that there are no replacements what is the female version of master or governor or whatever there arent any but then that says less about language than it does about the sexual politics of the last few centuries now only prisons have governors and only ships have masters the rest of us have bosses supervisors and ceos linguistically at least genderneutral
this article makes me sad
no need to be sad its not sexist
we should change manipulation to womanipulation
most of those definitions are correct or at least have reasonable explanations
selfdenial is the new morality
well these word games are a bit of fun thankyou emer heres another two words i rather like firstly hoyden probably lastused in lock up your daughters a great romp if you have a daughter you will need this at some point and secondly baggage used by me male to describe a female colleague to another female colleague in the s idlerx she cried thats sexist she is though
worked last year in a bristol office where every time the female seller made a sale another colleague shouted out good girl
skinn just wanted to say that i found your comment funny and have nowt to do with its disappearance
we clearly have a disgraceful set of sexist words to deal and put right with as a society for a start we should change menstruation to womenstruation long overdue
anyone who used wench seriously in  would be laughed at and told to go to a medieval fair
i wouldnt bother replying to someone who is both rude and illogical you havent actually heard anything in real life so it doesnt make sense in my opinion the word bossy is neutral but then i am female a feminist older and hence not representative of a current class of school children if it has acquired a female only meaning that would be interesting i believe there was some hoohaa over this word but that more or less passed me by does anyone think it is a female only word does anyone think it is a neutral word
he was joking especially considering that scots would never do something for free that was a joke too
do feminists a few miles east of liverpool live in personchester
maybe i need a new dictionary then how often do you think we should buy a new one
well there are those things that hold in water that also mean a lesbian there is the word human of which contains the word man it should be huperson the word lunatic luna is the feminine in many languages description of the moon thus the implication that unstable women have something to do with the moon the word manage as in manager implying that only males manage it should be changed to personager the word for female dog should be changed as the one for female horse just female dog and female horse instead of the other words also cow we need to find another word for cow and we need to do it now what is needed is an entirely new language perhaps we could change english to espermanto i mean esperanto
and beatings a strange post i dont remember our society condoning men beating women or women beating men i thought there was a law against it hohum i must be wrong oh maybe your suggesting that using words that denote gender encourages men to beat women oops i used men and women which makes me a misogynist who promotes the beating of women he manhole cover blue pink actress headmaster stop it stop it i hear you cry think of the battered women out there those french with their gender specific words must really make you angry
most of the blogs perfectly illustrate the effect generations of sexist language has had not only on sexism but it would seem weakening the minds capacity to make any logical empirically justified point at all it is ironic that the abusive bloggers are completely oblivious to this and almost no one among the naysayers has actually contradicted the use of the words selected or the historic narrowing of meaning the examples chosen include some key words in every day use too i find it patently dishonest for bloggers on this thread to act as though terminology was not highly sexist and biased against women it is part of our every day lives casanova versus tart anyone for sleeping around the absurd responses make the case for eliminating sexist definitions of words in dictionaries they show how embedded sexism is undoubtedly partly as a consequence
i actually found this article really interesting its sad that these things can become a bit sensationalised at the end of the day languages evolve over hundreds or thousands of years and probably reflect society as it is its peoples attitudes that are sexist or racist etc not the language they are speaking i not going to take my newspik dictionary off the shelf just yet
i cant believe you would make such an islamophobic comment in these hallowed pages
what about governess surely that has been almost entirely superseded by au pair or nanny no not the same thing at all lord and lady muck do not employ an aupair governess is a more responsible more long term position it hasnt been superseded so much as made largely redundant
well women are not called that often wankers losers perverts dicks cavemen pig ponce pillock coward chicken yellow and theres probably tons more that i cant think of
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language i dont think they are all sexist but even if they were these eight words arent the heart of the english language
good point and a comment criticising a comment which criticises an article thats criticising a dictionary is about as far from orwellian as anything but it is becoming a bit kafkaesque
one way english is less sexist than german there are very few gendered occupation names eg waiter waitress in german you cant move for them and theres endless furious arguments if for reasons of style someone wants to use maleonly occupation names
an interesting article from a linguistic perspective but offers nothing on feminism what about typical x man x up man x flu man x beater wife feminists are so blinkered that they find what they want to find
often this takes the form of pejoration when the meaning of the word gets worse over time but how much of this is down to the use of euphemisms is it simply that people made the meaning of mistress worse or that they tried to be nicer to women who were having sex with married men in the case of governess we see the same thing today where job titles are used to make a relatively humble positions seem more prestigious when i was a student i spent a few weeks on a job that involved watching a machine that packed bottles and changing a roll of plastic every few hours as required if something went wrong all i was supposed to do is call someone else officially i was a technical operator we see the same thing in other areas survivor is often used to mean victim in situations where nonsurvival would hardly be the expected outcome i dont see this as a result of antisurvivor attitudes but an attempt to be more supportive of victims so i suspect its not just about outright disrespect for women but also about putting them on a pedestal and protecting their honour this is also sexist in its own way but much more complicated
isnt it womyn or the etymologicallymonstrous wombmyn or who knows what the heck
so in your opinion language is only shaped by men ive seldom heard an equally sexist comment on the guardian you are completely devaluating the works of thousounds of female writers who coined a massive amount of terms and phrases by simply stating that language has been made by men it hasnt and i refuse to belief any further sexist statements that women have been unable to influence speech and language because they have its utterly disgusting to hear such bigoted viewpoints from anybody even more so if its coming from a woman
he is writing specifically about pejoration i cant think of many examples of male words that were initially equally equal to their female counterpart but have over time turns into denigrations can you
what is the male version of tart a negative term for someone who is everyones sweethearta womaniser
i agree partially sexism exists and language can reflect this and i certainly think you are right about some people exaggerating the intentions of those opposed to the use of gender pejorative terms but i disagree on your accusation of whatabouttery if we are to suggest that english displays negative attitudes to women then surely it is necessary to point out that it also does so to men of course there would be a strong case for questioning whether it does so to the same extent but the citicism still appears to be a valid one personally i think a better analysis would be one that shows how these pejorative terms reflect perceptions of gender in general and perhaps even enforce certain views manup and unladylike being possible examples of how behaviour that doesnt fulfil gender expectations is derided
mill on the floss is by eliot in germany one of the examples of sexism in language thats been debated is that the two main words for a girl mädchen and fraulein are neuter and the main word for boy junge is masculine it argues that girls are objects until they become women or so say some
there was since i suspect the battle was lost decades ago a hoohah about sexism being caused or propagated or in some vague way encouraged in english by the fact that the pronoun of common or unspecified gender was he somehow it implied that women were a kind of deviant form of maleness of course it was never clear that languages which accommodated all of this were not obviously less enlightened towards women
im  sure that political correctness was first introduced to me in school before the  elections
you raise an interesting point and i have no easy answer but perhaps we do need to look rather carefully at the use we make of these terms what we apply them to and at some of the extrapolations the pc commissars make from essentially harmless comments or incidents i think we need to keep a sense of proportion there is a difference between genocidal racism for instance and teasing a scot for being careful with money or making distinctions between say the greek and swedish cultures and i maintain that outrage on behalf of another group who may not be offended at all is often patronising and in my view racist putting oneself in the saviour category and the group in the victim category ask yourself which party feels better about their categorisation
nice rant but no where near complete
i like that one im going to use it
james delingpole referring to a woman well into her sixties as a girl found it astonishing that alibhaibrown had turned a tweet that was mildly unflattering into a threat indeed to view such comments as condoning violence against women was beyond the pale well i dont know anyone who believed that tweet as an actual threat to violence nor do i know anyone real person not on twitter who read the comment and believed it legitimated violence against women this is what one philosopher suggested explicitly it was claimed the intent was irrelevant so what we have is another illjudged comment turned into a totemic examplejust because there is an apparent shortage of real bigots to invoke as folk devils to make yourself look good there is a need to grandstand oneoff ill judged comments regardless of intent they are still supposedly the tip of an iceberg funny how we never see this iceberg the interesting thing was alibhaibrown was the one openly enthusing about her loathing as if bigotry and hatred were a virtue meaning politically correct bigotry of course i guess mentioning that would not serve this empty campaign against bigotry
political correctness is basically just cultural marxism the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms havent you forgotten to add the usual frankfurt school from your dogeared pamphlet
some good points here maybe a lead teacher is a leaden one
i think its more about where insisting rightly on people treat each other with mutual respect changes into an overbearing linguistic puritanism where peoples conversation is obsessively picked over for minute signs of contagion its what happens when religion dies the same personality types need to find reasons to damn their fellows while having a little rivate sin behind closed doors
i sense a little bit of misplaced outrage always interesting to hear views from america on jewish folk given that certainly in britain they are just one of many minority religious groups and also at the same time a quasiethnic group given that all the main studio heads are jewish and the us population is majorly christian its no surprise that those who work in hollywood recognise this and no doubt consider it both worthy of a comment and indeed may think either positively or negatively of it what does verge into unpleasant territory is when people make an assumption that all the jewish studio heads act in concert as part of a jewish mafia and that they are purposefully excluding good decent white christian folk
yes they are entitled to a minimum level of respect and dignity but also need to be ready to accept fair criticism and that is where all this unravelssorry but if i pay taxes all my working life pulled myself out of redundancy situations moved the family to find work worked with all the family to try to keep free of debt drugs and crime do not be surprised if i am critical sometimes vociferously at some people playing the systems or taking no control
spot on why do we still keep on with the term politically correct it is and always was far less to do with politics than with commonsense societal good behaviour anypne else out there feel that the term socially correct kinda fits better the idea that we dont call people fags or other being a fag myself and now that southpaw is no longer a term of abuse fag and its synonyms are the only words i feel able to write even in scare es and how pathetic of oldman and ilk to even suggest that if you take the nastiness the antisemitism the racism the homophobia or the mysogyny out of language youve also removed all the jokes and the colour do they truly think its impossible to be amusing without making a lesbian a paraplegic or a chinese family feel bullied and ashamed
we didnt have all this political correctness malarkey when i was growing up we just had good manners yes i grew up in those days the words nigger and jewboy were seen as normal everyday speech in every class
pc was imported from the usa the home of many silly ideas during the labour years people were polite before pc and we did not need it or ask for it but it was forced on us by the ruling classes and the media like fascism and communismit is government enforcing what people should think
if he believes what hes saying why did then then apologise for saying it no point moaning about the liberal dictatorship and pc brigade and then bowing down to itthese people are cowards rather than having some sort of instant moral conscience straight after i suppose we should be thankful theyre so easily scared into submission
there is no difference tolerance is about believing that people have the right to hold and express beliefs that you disagree with therefore if you dont allow the intolerant you yourself are being intolerant
language crime is just a small step towards thought crime and elizabeth ist wisdom about not making windows into mens souls holds true today we are distracted by such petty name calling from action in core areas of education health housing and jobs where issues of equality and discrimination are experienced at their worst i am often called paki and queer but i can live with that what i dont like is being denied my eg education because of my class race sexuality because of the actions of those with money power and influence who act against my interests and other minorities while pretending they are in fact right on by using pc language oh and then they go and try convince themselves and everyone else it is all the fault of those nasty uneducated white working class racist brits
be nice and people will be nice to you if only things were like that people lose their jobs because their bosses realize what ass holes they are and the bosses who sack you because youre caught using the wrong language are the bosses who only take on black workers in menial roles
the term pc as used in the last few decades was defined by people like gary oldman if i was to try and name the concept it would be something pithy meaning language affects how people think its pretty obvious really language taboos have been around as long as there has been language get used to it
oh dear the author cant even put the context from the interview which would render her synthetic i hope outrage pointless what a surprise me blogger with a huge chip on their shoulder finding ways to take a slightnot pc language is widely viewed as an encroachment on individual freedom thats because it is just because a few jobsworthsvips have decided whats offensive it means apparently were not allowed to say what hell we want must be a wet dream for wannabe stasi that occupy cif churchill said fascism would rise again under the guise of antifascism how right he was this article and uaf are ample proof
free markets in the uk have a laugh when youve read a book on capitalism let me know no not been forced to have a gay marriage but had to live through marriage being destroyed by the leftso thanks for being one of the many with no standards
i spoke to a jimi hendrix lookalike in  he told me that the newampnbspampnbsp pc language that was emerging was rubbish he was black and proud to be black it was his skin colour as for em later me then bme they appear to be white lefty constructs surely his first name is relevant but the language of pc requires the separation of people into racist subgroups
when the very first paragraph of the article willfully distorts what oldman actually said it doesnt the relevant interview section puts it beyond doubt i learned yesterday that the term for this type of gainsaying is gaslighting you really can learn something from articles so yes there is always a point in reading on
she never the less might be a little grateful and she has despite her protestations done quite well out of it
the left hypocrisy usa cant use the word coloured for a black south africa coloured is a recognised racial designation you cant use black in some circlesyou cant use nier unless you are blackyou cant use faot unless you are gayyou cant use binman they are hygiene techniciansair hostesses is banned stewardesses came next now too its banned now its flight attendantmankind for human kindsecretary to personal assistant to administrative managerheadmaster to lead teacher what the hell is a lead teachergirlfriend to partnerhusband to partnerbusiness partner to partnerfat to size impairedshort to height impairedstupid moronic dipstick to liberalnext year all of these will offend someone else its endless
homosexuality very specifically refers to sexual orientation nothing else transgender is a separate issue although included in discussions of lgbt but that is a broad group rather than an issue of sexuality itself as to debating we could debate whether the earth is flat but to what end its an issue that has been settled as has homosexuality it exists what else needs to be said any debate is solely done as part of an attempt to perpetuate discrimination against gay people
pc language and the ideology that underpins it is almost cultist and yet we must all moderate our views at the dinner table for fear of upsetting you
is unreconstructed those who didnt learn anything from their time in the gulag
again what we see here is propaganda at it s best this guy isnt just against political correctness it s about double standard and yes political correctness is apply with double standard not equalyif a white men says anything that sound hatefull to some people he will be hang on the public place to be stoned by everybody meanwhile minorities can go around and say everything they want even the most hatefull things and no one condems them this is pathetic and not just at all that kind of double standard political correctness must be fought not followed the day political correctness will be apply equaly to everybody no double standard maybe it would be a good thing but until that happen political correctness is pure brainwashing serving only a handfull of manipulator not the majority of the peopledont believe if you are a white men go on a public place and say nigger check what will happen next send a black person screaming crackers you wont see the same thing applying to the black person hatefull comment vs the white person hatefull comment so participating in the double standard political correctness we have today would only be participating and breeding injustice
you live in a county mostly shaped by thatcherites and consumers and free markets if your local radical left wing vegan freecyclers have forced you to undergo a gay marriage you have my sympathy
i am superior to you in that i am more sensitive to the nuances of language and behaviour the whole thing is absolutely true but what i find really funny about it is that the people most obsessed with pc language i have met are by far the ones least sensitive to language and its various nuances
the persistent rightwing offensive  ermany of us on the left wing hate political correctness so its not a left versus right issue in fact ive always thought of pcness as a right wing idea since its usually the liberal fraternity who use it to shout down debate
agreed language crime is just a heartbeat away from thought crime
i agree its bizarre it happens over and over people say nasty or just plain vile things about others then complain about being victimised when they receive criticism its an undoubted good that social attitudes have changed that it is considered bad manners when somebody is derogatory about another person it isnt true no matter what bullies like to think that everybody secretly agrees with them on the contrary its not only the targets of homophobia or racism or misogyny who find it odious it seems to be creeping back into popular discourse this awful climate of opinion towards anybody considered inferior somehow from unemployed adults to drug addicts to people who are overweight or disabled or foreign its not acceptable to talk to or about people as if they were not human everybody is entitled to a minimum level of dignity and respect
do people whose families have been in dorset for  years have some moral obligation to relinquish their local identities because some guardian columnist whose family has been here less than  years wants a piece of it sorry can you be specific about what guardian columnists want the people in dorset to relinquish i am currently in lyme regis on a business trip and have seen no signs that the locals are suffering under the tyranny of guardian columnists and their dictats might pop into a thai restaurant tonight see if the locals are content to eat foreign muck
grow up 
the rhetorical inversion of language as symbols is nothing new the greeks did it the roimans did it the northern irelanders have made a speciality of it so why wouldnt the reactionaries do it really while i sympathise with okolosies feelings this is a lost cause and a demonstration of putting the cart before the horse or language before the fact pc just drives bigotry underground causes it to learn new techniques of subversion making it harder to pin down harder to prevent and much much harder to educate awaythis is one reason for not over reacting to vebal cases of bigotry likely committed by the uninformed rather than those with a genuine agenda of bigotdy it is a case for reacting firmly and decisvely when facts of bigotry take place sticks and stones it is a case for policing equal access to professional and social advancement so that those laughed at today have the last laugh tomorrow
isis could bomb every town and city in this country and would not come close to the damage inflicted and being inflicted on this country by the radical left and their constantly dissatisfied weapon political correctness
i dont find the idea of political correctness at all left wing it may have been introduced by people who might describe themselves as on the left but they are more the new labour types who are really only interested in control rather than any socialist principles
pc can be used as a concept to raise awareness and effect positive change in society for many people who experience negative treatment and conditions but like many things in life it has its pros and cons and is full of pitfalls it seems to me that attitude comprehension and a firm grasp on reality are key to keeping it constructive equality cannot be attained by making oneself out to be morallyintellectually superior tolerance is not about demonisation prejudice or rejection democracy is not being practised if you ignore dismiss or shut down some sectors of society adhering to pc principles is a difficult challenge that is beset by pitfalls and misuse being perceived as pc is an appealing image to many but sincerity and integrity would be required in order to avoid it being mere token lipservice to the latest fashionable causes thats a tall order but a valuable ambition not to be confused with closed minded people using pc to justify their own collection of prejudices
good question that should be directed at mrs okolosie who claimed or evenually tickboxed at the pcs hugging pet list you cant even call gay men faggotsracist sexist ableist and homophobic more seriously if society is a moral battlefield as nietzsche said and there is no a moral but rather morals a debate about the change in the public perception as well as professionals such as the dsm editors regarding homosexuality is not that illegitimate moreover since homosexuality is an all encompassing term that includes transgenders for instance a discussion about the ethical considerations concerning medical procedures or mutilations without a physical justification is a kind of a public discourse you cannot rule out can you
a lot of things radical leftwingers say offend me in fact most of what this nobody has typed but i dont cry into my drink i just carry on and make people respect me by working hard being a good father and husband and not expecting respect because of my sex or colour of my skin
oldman says somethingsome people goes crazy most dont notice or careoldman apologises for nothingsome people still not happy media created shit storm now successfully converted to click bait
one of the major problems with pc is how it is affecting young people who dont have the background knowledge to understand where it comes from and so lack any meaningful framework within which to grasp why it exists for example in discussing the black character of crooks in steinbecks of mice and men during english classes pupils have objected to the use of the word black this has happened several times in several different places therefore a fuller understanding of racism is difficult to attain likewise i was in a history class where a pupil accused a teacher of racism against the nazis when the crimes of the nazis came up for discussion i kid you not the right will use the term pc and abuse it but in some ways it really has led to complete disconnection and frightening examples of censorship and threats should a teacher be afraid to use the term black when discussing africa slavery or black characters in literature that really is mad
the question is why ever do actors think their thoughts are incredibly insightful when their career consists of saying someone elses words this is asked whenever an actor or anyone in the arts voices an opinion some people disagree with they are asked their opinion by journalists journalists ask them this because large sections of the public are interested in actors lives actors authors and musicians do not call the bbc or cnn and ask them to clear a space on the  oclock news so they can air their opinion however an actors opinion is neither more nor less valid than another persons a persons opinion shouldnt be dismissed simply because their career consists of saying someone elses words almost every career can be reduced to a pithy summary a persons opinion should be dismissed or engaged with solely on the content of that opinion
we now know what he thinks not if youve only read this article you dont
a lot of times people who make comments about jews are targeting the ethnicity rather than the religion the same applies to a lesser extent with muslims as many of those who most froth at the mouth about muslims really hold much the same attitude toward anyone who looks middle eastern be they muslim hindu sikh or atheist its often a shield for racists to hide behind pretending that race isnt their target
it is a whole heap of prejudices in its own right mostly against various groups such as evangelical christians and practicing catholic christians that hold to their beliefs so any right wing brit who cant stand catholics is pushing his politically correct agenda as he rants about them in the pub but if i then defend catholics in response to a vicious attack from this bloke am i not being politically correct too
private individuals with limited resources suddenly confronted with the amassed and aligned resources of militant minorities used to intimidate and repress views they prefer not to have to engage with in open debate examples of this and what issues should have been the subject of debate
pc language and the ideology that underpins it is almost cultist like a religious movement humourless certainly dangerous and unforgiving it is also often used in a dishonest way with a discourse more appropriate to the salem witch trials and certainly the recourse by the twittering class to hounding individuals is like a mob baying at a pubic execution i am not surprised people are now not taking it seriously as it is the only refugee of rather second rate ppe students
those who hanker for the good old days where you could slag off anyone and they ought to be able to laugh it off usually miss the good old days when people seemed a bit more polite i think its more about where insisting rightly on people treat each other with mutual respect changes into an overbearing linguistic puritanism where peoples conversation is obsessively picked over for minute signs of contagion worryingly about this is emphatically not the same as nostalgia for the good old days when you could leave a flaming cross on your neighbours lawn and it was all seen as a bit of fun
exactly were being made to treat other human beings as such regardless of race gender sexual orientation what bloody horrible thoughcontrol and if we dont we get told that its bad how properly north korean but using slurs to demean and threaten entire sets of people has nothing to do with the way language shapes thought of course only political correctness
political correctness is all that is left after the dream of socialism has died
pc really stands for publicly courteous as in essence thats what it means people arent pc in private both a good and a bad thing but in public discourse we have a duty to speak as we would wish to be spoken to ie not to knowingly cause offence its a simple moral equation
nonsense thats precisely what a social consequence looks like only famous people or those in positions of power are ever hammered to quite that extent anyway and frankly as they are in a position of greater influence so must they also be held to a higher standard
and in fact some of the ones you mention and others as well were in some times and places considered the politically correct alternative and then they fell out of favour i recently saw someone decry the term homosexual as pejorative as well and attack an apparently nicely intentioned person who used it i think trying to not hurt others feelings is important and people should try and speak precisely but i dont really blame people for feeling it isnt really worth it to bother at times
no ones policing their language actually language is being policed byerthe police hate speech legislation much as i find it ridiculous that wealthy white straight males can claim to be bullied by pc i think that lola absolutely hits the nail on the head here what is needed is a rejection of the anodyne compromise that political correctness has become once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures believing in equality and the fundamental changes that are required to realise it means working on ourselves as individuals at the level of language and the institutions that sustain our unequal society simply minding your words isnt enough and when we say it is we leave the values of the term open to lip service and this is why hate speech legislation was a mistake it leaves the aims that lie behind the idea of political correctness discreetly to one side whilst simply policing language for example a magistrate who regularly hands out heavier sentences to young black men would rightly lose their job if they called a defendant by the nword but the bias of their sentencing simply gets a free pass
exactly the writer does not provide full es but cherry picks words and then distorts their use out of the context of what oldman really said
political correctness has always struck me as being essentially right wing in character since it imitates chillingly the manipulation of language and behavior the imposition of taboos and restrictions on free speech that are the trademarks of all fascistic regimes
the accepted vernacular is victims of alcohol dependency 
so youre suggesting the manchester thing wasnt in fact oldmans handiwork
cool story bro
well hes a damned marvelous actor but he does seem to be challenged on the inhibition control front
so happy to have been your th recommender there billy
to be politically correct is to be right haha wonderful non sequitur
i dont think the poster wasnt suggesting that she should not enjoy those rights and freedoms i think the poster was suggesting that her attitude toward the country that gave her those rights and freedoms has been a tad shall we say ungrateful and hypocritical which mumsnot has a perfect british right to point out
when the very first paragraph of the article willfully distorts what oldman actually said is there any point in reading oni havent much sympathy for what oldman did say but to lie about what he said is utterly selfdefeating and hypocritical which is in fact what oldman was talking about hypocrisy
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as in if you tell a whopping great lie about someone in a column everyone will believe you particularly if you are very liberal about the appropriate use of ation marks
the sole point about political correctness is that in effect you are saying to others look i am more sensitive than you are i am more civilised more sophisticated am capable of more sympathy and kindness more analytical empathy i am superior to you in that i am more sensitive to the nuances of language and behaviouretc etc and whats the problem with that sensitivity civilisation sophistication sympathy kindness empathy are these not what makes us human do we want to be less of them are we supposed to be quiet when others are uncivilised unsophisticated unsympathetic lack empathy are unkind
a greater equality of material start in life greater equality of opportunities to which your inherent abilities can be applied where inequality will come out of course b no one grants it which is why people have had to take it over the years certainly in economic terms many countries manage to have much lower levels of inequality than the uk less poverty less differences in health outcomes less differences in educational outcomes based on background
having just read what gary oldman said in the playboy interview and as a jew i dont really find it that insulting he was after all telling some truths we all have and willl at some point use a term or an expression about a particular group that is insulting and hurtful saying that he was silly to hilight mel gibson who after saying fucking jews which is at the limit of the forgiveness stick went on to blame us for the all the worlds wars which is antisemitism and on a different level of shitness
the problem is not so much social consequences as the consequences for private individuals with limited resources suddenly confronted with the amassed and aligned resources of militant minorities used to intimidate and repress views they prefer not to have to engage with in open debate
the first examples of political correctness adapting phrases and meanings to influence political views or change they way we think stems from the us military and had a distinct militaristic bent now so many of these pc terms are so embedded in the lexicon they are rarely questioned of course being militaristic and of the right they are not deemed pc because bizarrely populist conceptions are that only the left engages in such behaviour if interested read noam chomsky syntactic structures  funded by the us military and thereafter almost anything else he has written in particular the use of language by the military during the first gulf conflict the first televised war
the celebrity sausage machine ingredients anything may contain traces of artificial colouring
hes bemoaning that if he did drunkenly run down canal street shouting fags that he might be subject to criticism for it but he hasnt said anything even remotelylike that youve once again put words in his mouth and sentiments in his head
you actually did claim it you specifically said differences between the sexes have been eliminated not by changing our biology thank god but by disallowing gendered words you seem really keen to defend the use of the word spastic as the correct way to refer to certain types of people it comes across as at best someone who doesnt want language to evolve in which case youre fighting a losing battle at worst you come across as a huge bigot again youre fighting a losing battle why you think your personal liberties to use plain english which from what youve posted here seems to consist largely of various slurs should be more important that the personal liberties of people who want to live in a society where people are treated equally and respected i dont understand
its really uncool to say all that especially in an interview behind closed doors with your mates fine say what you like we all do so youre in agreement with g oldman about hypocricy then
if its a lie why did the bbc cancel its programme if its a lie why has everyone who expressed the opinion that multiculturalism might not be right for every county everywhere all the time been called a racist im no particular supporter of ukip on the contrary i have repeated endlessly in countless threads that is farage and ukip are the not the creations bad british people but of tonedeaf governments and the pc brigade who insisted that there was only one way to view vast changes to britain in a short time their way farage is a snakeoil salesman but his opportunity has been handed to him by labour and the tories who condescended to the views of people already here who thought silly arses that they had a right to have a say in what kind of country britain should be id be the last person to deny that racism exists but it exists in both directions the pc brigade is only indignant about the racism that runs in one direction and does have only one view of multiculturalism and rapid immigration the force of that opinion backed by cynical to indifferent government policies did cut off any possible debate on that topic
its slippery there are at least three types of political correctness the first is thinking about and using language to reflect basic politeness a desire to treat others as one would wish to be treated and to avoid causing them unnecessary discomfort the second version is a chimera evoked by oldschool bigots who like oldman sometimes reach enough awareness to be realise that their bile insecurity and shaky sense of entitlement will much to their detriment be exposed when held up to the light then theres the third version a weaselly unreflective usage by those ignorant enough to believe that their views are so beyond question that there can never be legitimate grounds for even the most nuanced dissent to these new bigots any disagreement can only ever be racist sexist islamophobic etc or most comically in the case of one of the weaker columnists in this paper a sure sign of misogyny
i have to tell you that not everyone had good manners back thenif fact some people were quite bad mannered in their use of racial insults in school playgroundsnot to mention the ill mannered people who refused black people or irish as tenantsim no fan of pc speak since it smooths over nasty thoughts and thingsbut please dont pretend that things were better before it was invented
the depths this newspaper goes to selectively choosing single words from an interview the n word the c word and then adding spin to them to make them fit your standard tired message
i like the way you say that a word cannot be racist in itself but then go on to write certain ways in a sort of code as if the word itself is so toxic you cant write it strange
if you grew up in the time before pc you grew up in a time when racial epithets were commonplace ah now i find that a very unfair assertion political correctness i would say didnt really exist as a concept before the eighties but i never never heard my parents using a racist word my white parents living in a white area of newcastle whod had little contact with other races but came from a decent background where treating people with respect was a standard i think i can extend what im saying to many other people so racial epithets were not as common as you imply not everyone in s britain was a racist
the left steeped in a totalitarian worldview loves to control thought language and expression on its terms actually the first examples of the thought action language came from the us military they are now so embedded in the lexicon that we accept them without questioning their political nature if interested read noam chomsky syntactic structures  funded by the us military and thereafter almost anything else he has written
i guess fleeing from uganda is more or less the same thing as being thrown out by a dictator on racist grounds which is what happened to heri guess going to the one country that offered them sanctuary wasnt much of a choice
as eric arthur blair george orwell observed thought shapes language as language shapes thought with political correctness we have a system of language which tells us which views or phraseswords are acceptable and which are not political correctness is no more than a complex form of throught control if it were used in north korea we would be jumping up and down about freedom of speech
chill babyx
physical assault on a group of people based upon their beliefs im sure theres a term for that
i think the devil is already out of the bottle on this one
the guardianistas actually view orwell as a culture hero despite invoking many of the tactics of the totalitarian government orwell created its as if orwell wrote a piece of fiction that couldnt possibly form the basis of all our law and culture in the uk in  isnt it so we end up with muslim fantatics being tracked by the totalitarian guardian reading graduates at gchq instead of everyone just ing orwell and letting the muslims say whatever they like whenever they like or put it this way all of the right wing newspaper websites operate a policy of comment moderation and editorial content control despite everyone having read orwell at school
welcome to the forum of its praetorian guard
there has always been some form of political correctness it just changes formidiots hark back to a time of freedom when you could happily call someone a nr but of course then you really coulldnt swear or talk about sex or say you were gay or criticise the royals you actually could not say these things not liker now where you can say pretty much anything although some people mught complain about you saying it which is not youll be surprised to hear censorship just when was this pcfree time of freespeech please
political correctness is not just about language policing although the last chapter of  on newspeak shows just how sinister that can be it is a whole heap of prejudices in its own right mostly against various groups such as evangelical christians and practicing catholic christians that hold to their beliefs as this article shows it allows no criticism anyone who dares to criticize it is immediately vilified and put in the same category as out and out racists
naacp ok coloured person racist person of colour this years cool expression i wouldnt exactly go so far as to call this situation confusing but theres hardly a hairs breadth between the last two still i find it remarkably easy not to offend people and i dont like the whole oh you cant say anything these days thing
yes it does seem to have been taken out of context although overall think the article makes a good point about how things have got turned around in this regard that being pc is now considered by many to be boring and hypocritical and that people who would try to ensure they dont offend others are now somehow in the wrong and it has to be said gary oldman does come across as an apologist for the antipc lobby even if hes doing it through the medium of ing others
yes but most people with serious concerns about immigration are bigots and closet racists they just get upset about being told they are such because they lack the honesty to be upfront about it respectfully i disagree with this premis
yasmin ab says extremely hateful things about the white working class that would have her done for hate crimes if she chose to say the black working class like what she endlessly spreads antibritish nonsense whilst enjoying all the rights and freedoms britain provides her yaz is british why should she not enjoy the rights and freedoms all british people enjoy

i can see why youre struggling but trust me the gender of nouns is the least of your concerns right now
because french like many other languages requires nouns to have masculine or feminine endings ah not quite right david the nouns themselves are either masculine or feminine its the endings of the adjectives that change in order to agree with the nouns
the fact a woman now prefers to be called an actor rather than an actress is not necessarily a progress it just tells that actor now sounds more professional than actressin spanish la profesora would never accept to be called el profesor in french some women want to be called la professeure while others opt for le professeur or even la professeur which is grammatically incoherent in english a feminine form for professor was not even considered
we could abandon the obnoxious and sometimes confusing use of they for a singular as practised by those appalling hacks austen thackeray defoe bagehot caxton and shakespeare
where was the outrage in an essentially gentle pisstake besides in yr head
the suggestion in then only looks preposteroussince we are talking only about nouns that refer to people we dont need to abolish all gendered nouns no point in stopping a tree from being masculine for exampleyou just have to create new words that describe jobs positions etc with random genders other gendered languages do thatin portuguese for example the word for spouse cônjuge is always masculine so even if you are a married to a woman you would still refer to her with this masculine noun and all the masculine pronouns and adjectives that it would requiresimilarly the word for person is feminine so when we talk about a random generic person we usually use she when someone is lost they usually ask for directions becomes when the person is lost she asks for directions everyone knows this person can be a man but it is referred to as she because of the grammatical nounits similar to royal titles your highness is used to address both princes and princesses but the word highness is feminine is most romance languages so adjectives etc have to be feminine to agree with the noun even when addressing a prince so you say votre grandeur est généreuse not généreux regardless if youre speaking to a prince or a princess
because french like many other languages requires nouns to have masculine or feminine endings i have often wondered about this le and la malarkeyi meanwhen something completely new is invented like the internet or a fitbit or a drone who is it that decides if its going to be a boy or a girl
french is a great language to learn but it is unpleasant to listen to as it is very nasal how much longer can it survive 
they is no more confusing as both a singular and plural word than you
i have spent so long learning france and ensuring the correct agreements and gender i will be upset if they just get rid of them at least the french academy uses the word gender in the right context unlike the guardian which regularly confuses gender with sex
one way to deal with this is to have an alternative form that covers everyone députées given that the pronunciation is identical anyway a possible solution would be to spell both versions dépyté but i suppose the immortelles would rather impale themselves on their pens than consider a sensible reform of french orthography kel dommaj
why tamper with the worlds finest language
thats a tricky one youd have to say les conducteursrices fouslles
non
what for it seems that having gender neutral words does not prevent english speaking countries from being drowned in harassment issues it does not make a big change in the view men have on women apparently
no the academy will lose against french speakers its utter bollicks that any institution can control a language
yes found it on line  nov and indeed by willsher
if this is the way its going why stop there why does every bloody noun have to be either masculine or feminine other than objects which inherently have gender eg man woman scrap the le and laand use a more genderneutral pronoun instead
no stop fcuking with the language
man city ladies should be woman city im actually surprised theyve not already done that
this republican would get rid of princess as a title as well as all the other tags that toffs use to get credit deference and their boots licked
the academy is a ridiculous antediluvian pile of sexist bollocks but the fabulous thing about all languages is that ultimately only users control them not unis teachers schools or academies language is the true face of democracy
maybe easier if one could understand your french
 members of the académie mr s so are there six vacancies if so dont put yourself forward for election not after this shallow piece of clickbait which is outshone by the much better news report on the matter some days ago from a gdn correspondent in paris kim willsher i think
why not use brackets instead of hyphens
i thought the academie abolished unnecessary circumflexes sorry hats a few years ago
just order two of everything problem solved
sorry guardian i think youll lose against the academy however right you think you are
its not even changing the languageonly an orthographic convention
gender for verbs french doesnt have them either polish does thoughyou wouldnt pronounce it differently the two words are pronounced the same way anywayin portuguese we write deputadosas if we have to say it we say deputados e deputadas
in french nothing is neutral even a chair is feminine while an armchair is masculine go figure there is nothing to figure this is a feature of almost all indoeuropean languages and is probably an echo of the original highlyinflected language millennia ago
our lefty municipal council has been using this style in its official publications for ages its hideous and so laborious to read
isnt the issue only about nounsanyways it could be done by writing fousolles fouolles fousfolles etc and pronounce by saying both words fous ou folles or fous et folles
das weis ich bereits
people of france you have nothing to lose but your gender markings the people of france are to assume an androgynous look 
technically it wouldnt even be a change in the language since these words are already pronounced the same its only an orthographic convention as all orthography is didnt these guys read their saussureanyways why not use a bracket députées thats how we do it in portuguese
there are neuter definite amp indefinite articles amp nouns in german but to add to the complexity they have feminine amp masculine too
headline bien sûr is correct in french sur means on or in relation to a masculine word is the adjective for sour
we are ok with losing our gender markings but we are very attached to our accents so please can we have a hat on sûr in the headline
i dont think anyone actually wonders that english is however generally regarded as one of the most difficult languages to learn despite its lack of genders and cases
no i cant but it was a french teacherlanguages historian who told me so i will ask again next time i see her i was fairly sure she said later than th century though
although ships are supposedly she the us navy seems to be very keen on naming them after men do these ships eg the uss ronald reagan still get referred to as she is this progressive or retrogressive its hard to know these days
youd probably get a whole lot less grief if you stopped flouncing around in that kilt too
well i cant disagree with that motivation i admire your esprit excuse me i have to go now to find an italian to argue about food with
any background though im interested where it all started
davids arrogance and cultural supremacy is mind bogglingi think the article is meant to be somewhat lighthearted
have these people gone complètement fou  fous or in the spirit of the proposed reforms fo u lle s i think
english has got rid of poetess and the like and actress is becoming rarer seamstress seems to have gone but that is probably because there arent any now but ive not come across anyone yet who wants to get rid of princess even though princesses now have equal rights of heredity to the throne what english does need though is a neutral personal pronoun for when you dont know the gender of the person being talked about then we could abandon the obnoxious and sometimes confusing use of they for a singular now often used even when the gender of the person is known
députées looks ridiculous would be slow to type i have no idea how you would pronounce it such that you heard an editional e of course if you are hearing the current plural you cannot hear a difference between the feminine amp masculine forms in english we are thankfully spared genders for verbs but we used to have various feminine forms for some nouns such as actress amp manageress it is not uncommon for women to be called actors now and i cant remember the last time i heard someone referred to as a manageress that sort of linguistic evolution is sensible amp i doubt any woman would regard it as a male take over why not just have a single word député amp have done with it students of french would be hugely grateful if genders amp adjectival agreement were dropped too
womens laughter
youre laughing but one of the things that would make my life so much easier as a scot living in france would be the abolition of gender in language les cochins vont vollés
the italians changed historia to storia
can you give any information about this alleged li ive studied french from the th century to the present and have not come across it
the french academy is railing against moves towards a genderneutral style but language always blends and changes without any loss of expressive powerthis sounds as though the whole of france was up in arms demanding the introduction of genderneutral linguistic constructions such as députéeswe live in france and this revolt has totally passed me by guess i must pay closer attention then
i though that being a smartass for my first comment would have been appropriate im supposed to be a pedantic french damn it i read the guardian to keep my english rustfree mostly and to be entertained by the brexit series given the absence of coverage in european new outlets
québec has been doing it for years but of course with the wrong accent 
no it comes from the british sailors
if france isnt a more sexist nation why does does anyone think that changing the language will make a difference
so towards the end of  the breakthrough year of outrage journalism the guardian gears up the game by getting properly outraged by the grammatical gender constructs in a latin languageoh my god there are sexist implications in a continental speech what on earth shall we do go hide in the cellars ban foreign stuff oh wait lets exit the eu altogether that will fix stuff
it is not about gender neutrality it is meant to be inclusive of both genders and certainly not a third one that would be neutral in french nothing is neutral even a chair is feminine while an armchair is masculine go figure probably another patriarchal heritage those old men of the académie are prone to defend comfortably installed into their armchairs but the french administration is in no way bound by the decisions of the french academy personnally i find this technocratic language horrible and impractical though while députées is workable consider sénateurrices in english senator is from latin senator which is masculine the feminine form is senatrix i bet you will not see senatorrix any time soon
since all nouns have a gender in french it is a lot harder than in english davids arrogance and cultural supremacy is mind boggling why not tell the french to speak another language altogether maybe english which is a lot better than that stupid foreign
merde
although you did take sufficient notice to choose this very foreign editorial to make your very first comment since registering with the foreign guardian
same as all nations then 
is klingon gender neutral im thinking of learning it
and accidentally killing someone of the female gender is going to be called womanslaughter
the academie is good fun let the bon temps roll
why are ships and vessels she does that come from french
rabelais is rolling in his grave
frankly there are easier ways to achieve that goal keep the simpler masculine gender and call it neutral in this situation hyphens are an insult to the eyeand btw  to you stuart 
it should do what you tell them guardian like the rest of the world oh
no the french nation is patiently awaiting guidance from the guardian
they cant possibly do this it would render most of the jokes in allo allo incomprehensible
after a comment i made the other day suggesting li as a gender neutral alternative to le and la with corresponding gender neutral endings for nouns ive since been told that a neutral li existed in french several centuries ago i wonder if it was the academie which did away with it
the deeper problem being being french
no the push for gender neutrality comes from exclusively from a class of academics with nothing important to do
does anyone know what proportion of french people actually want their language to become genderneutral or genderinclusive have there been any surveys
they should stop shilly shallying about and just speak english 
the groups and endings thing is a symptom of the deeper problem that nouns themselves are gendered le mot but la parole as he says its not just a french thing not likely to change any time soon
i for one one dont but i dont take notice from foreign editorial on my language in foreign newspapers either
and people wonder why english is the worlds lingua franca irony noticed btw
adding a dash or two wont get the pute out of députées
we need to change history to herstory when discussing past events involving women
britain is moving further into the atlantic with brexit which should logically make anglosaxon political correctness even easier to resist unless distance makes the heart grow fonder
i fart in your general direction
zut alors
sacre bleu
do the french actually take any notice of the french academy
one radical solution of course is for members of the academy to become reformers rather than reactionaries and eliminate masculine and feminine forms altogether lolz
le petomaine encore 
malefemale terms can be a problem in english legal language in wills for example talking about unborn children and so on american lawyers have a term for it they say male embraces female
i recently learned that the french call an electoral list that alternates men with women to ensure gender equality a liste chabadabada from the wordless vocals to frances lais famous soundtrack to the film un homme et une femme
totally with you for keeping our difference
whilst i agree with the original poster they may want to consider the fact that english offers a simply delightful range of arbitrariness and illogicality mostly to do with spellingpronunciation and stress patterns of its own to rival the french not to detract from french exceptionnalisme of course
en péril mortel in mortal danger thanks for translating that for us not being a native speaker its hard to know whos right although i will say that the causes of linguistic change are rarely topdown
most of the spanish masculine words ending in a come from the greek like telegrama remember those
i wonder if that has anything to do with the germans being a bit unsure whether butter is masculine or feminine
the swiss use octante for  but the belgians use quatrevingts four s as do the frenchwe used to do this in english of course four score years and ten is identical to quatrevingtdix
why not just focus on meaningful changes instead of obsessing over symbolic ones there is no need for gender in language to affect anything that actually matters whether people are called députés or députées actually makes no difference i dont get why we worry so much about language instead of behaviour id guess its because its simpler
english is primitive as compared to french
six mps one man and five women would be called députés not députées the way to deal with this is to have an alternative form that covers everyone in my view it should more likely bedéputéeeeees but this way masculine still prevails as it comes first
the french do have a thing about their definite articles a french parent cannot just call his or her children by shouting enfants non non it must be les enfants
well yes i googled greek origin words in spanish i thought there was a suggestion in an earlier post that all the greek imports into sp with a ending were masculine
i rather like the rather ingenious spanish solution that you sometimes see in print eg chicsltigt which combines both the o and a of masculine and feminine endings the sign is called arroba and chicarrobas hermanarrobas etc has become a bit of a thing in our house
there were jokesi thought it was a documentary
la suède of course
ok jeff if youre writing french you need to leave a space before the exclamation marks same goes for question marks colons semicolons surtout is one word and différence takes an acute accent having said that i applaud your sentiments
anyone know the french for shillyshally
as long as people have a nose good moaning i ave good nose sorry couldnt resist
lordinateur ffs
surely the fact that the word woman has the word man in it creates some sort of issue ditto person and son
best thing with french country names are either feminine or masculine and preceded by a definite article la france langleterre fem la grandebretagne fem la finlande le maroc la nouvellezélande le luxembourg la russie le brésil largentine fem le suède but le danemark and there is a reason why it is as it is i think this part of french language is specially enjoyable leat at least languages be the last place where you find arbitrary silly and illogical things especilly since these things have been forbidden everywhere else
i have often wondered about this le and la malarkey try german der die and das which decline to den dem or des in some cases
i didnt think we were talking about tampering with english if we are im all for it
but surely only girls wear dresses right jokes
its bien sûr actually or was that a deliberate mistake made in a spirit of antipedantry to match the article perhaps
like doctor actually doctress or doctoress did exist it just isnt used nowadays perhaps its time to reintroduce it for one particular fictional timetravelling crossgenderregenerating person
all those words are greek every one
you mean la langage
just be glad that french noun and adjective endings do not chance according to case like they do in german or polish or russian or many other difficult languages
the queen in jersey is still refered as le duc and certainly not la duchesse because the duchy of normandy under salic law required the sovereign to be male so they do as if she was a he an early case of transgendering i suppose
not to mention septante but whatever happened to octante
yesi have discovered it is also swiss frenchthank you for clarifying my comment
guardian please note that such articles illustrating how laughable institutions proposing something else than the why bother with anything other than the english language doxa one day on the académie française another day on the as of non english speaking music on radio and so on belong to the daily mail only you could be subject to accusations of plagiarism if you carry on like this
 why not just use latin normal usage 
pedantette
people of france you have nothing to lose but your gender markings mais non cest terrible ça vive la langue française vive les gender markings et sur tout vive la diffèrence
the distinction isnt really anymore helpful than in any other gender neutral job termthe actor in the role of lady macbeth the actor in her latest role is no different from doctor or writer the use of feminine job distinctions is nearly always a way to give a less serious veneer to the job and given the treatment vof many actresses in the industry its high time it was gone
yes and brussels is in belgium
sistema idea tema música política gramática historia some masc some fem who knows why
its not easy the presumed lack of hard rules suggests that but the exceptions to rules indirect requests syntax prepositions phrasal verbsamong many other oddities are very hard to get right or at least to pass oneself off as proficient as a native speaker anecdotal judgements are no match for the vast experience from linguists and teachers who will confirm that if english was so easy the elt business wouldnt be generating bn annually

oh get a gripit was a light hearted look at how institutional control of language doesnt work in the endf for comprehension
non
i would agree with that it was only when my wife and i started giving informal english lessons at the local equivalent of a community centre that i realised just what an illogical language it is just to take one example you can almost always be confident that a french word will be pronounced the way its spelled no such luck with english im pathetically grateful that english is my mother tongue and that it was french i was obliged to work in on the subject of the article all our odd students  classes from beginners to almost fluent and everyone else we know regard these proposals as a complete farce intended only to give the fonctionnaires something to do
i remember trying to explain to my older brother decades ago that cows are feminine and milk is masculine in french because that made sense to somebody or other
i stand corrected
well it couldnt be womanchester city because that would be silly
ever read the awful german language by twain
qapla
you now should write godgodess help us all to be pc just kidding
fcuking  intentionally or not that is brilliant
theres equality a la pay and conditions of work respectful treatment etc and then theres equality a la political correctness at all costs and an overwhelming urge to throw the baby out with the bathwater this is most definitely a case of the latter french is a beautiful language especially when spoken and written correctly and is as rich as english in the right hands all languages have anomalies and french can be maddeningly anomalous but to eradicate its gender roots for the sake of currentday over sensibilities is just crass so vive lacadémie française feminine for making this standyet another step too far towards all things homogenous and equal
you peopleit calls for raising your voice when used

single european currency single european language cmon thats progressive
chapeau two articles and counting on something that isnt even getting any coverage in france nor does the heavyhanded humour wash it just reads as monolingual monocultural arrogance the default mode of lecturing the french on how to run their country what do you call someone who speaks two languages bilingual three trilingual just one language british or us american now lets try an other one that is more current the catalans should not be allowed to speak their own language cos its complicated whos going to write that one
exactly a distinction between actor and actress is actually quite helpful to the observer it informs it tells us perhaps what kind of parts they may play and more pc norms are depressing the uk is a particularly bad case ok apparently to avoid calling a person of colour bk but also perfectly ok to treat them like shit pc is the last refuge of the social coward hypocrisy run amok
nouns not verbs my mistake
the french academy has tended to enshrine exiting language usage and from time to time it has been ignored by the majority of the population i remember the mild distain induced in some french friends by my use of the term nonante i learned french late in life in brusselsthis is however quite a change from existing practice and i doubt it will have much impact except at the fringes of the language
problema is from greek
learn to what levelenglish sentence structure is hard
men who dont wear them always have a problem with men who do
one of the great things about different languages is their little quirks i love the fact that in spanish for example most words ending in a are feminine but certain ones arent dentista and problema for a start i understand the latter is from the latin so ends with an a but how they determined in the first place whether they should be male or female is beyond me
thats not necessary in the same way that its not necessary to distinguish case as youve just used it from case as in a piece of luggage the correct meaning is obvious from context
le chat est sur la tablehope this helps
greek is the worlds finest languagenowhere have i advocated any tampering with anything anywhere i merely pointed out that users control language and its changes not institutionsfrench is quite safe from me i dont use it
like doctor not however of the slightest of concern to sanewell adjusted women who do not require pc attack dog protection on everymission in society in a world where millions are starving abused sold into slavery being bombedto bitsdoes it really matter to anyone but the pcinsane chattering classes that some words do not have a specific feminine form which is seemingly considered almost criminal in some liberal circles god help us all oops another red rag there
some nouns do have endings that show gender
even the french revolution did not manage to scrap the academy
this wikipedia page has some examples sire votre majesté estelle prête pour la fête sir is your majesty ready for the party but in french you actually say sir your majesty is she readyfeminine for the party
what a load of old bolleaux
once ms word has this kind of thing on autocorrect it will be a lot easier
latin americans are starting to do this with the term latinx versus latino latina i personally cant stand it but also cant disagree with the notion that language is everchanging and fluid and owned by those who use it i may just have to get used to that x
who decides what is feminine and masculine anyway i always figured these were just labels used which had little actual gender to them
aussi longtemps quil y aura des français
have they tried this on audio books yet reading out loud in classas a man i am a bit confused as i consider myself une personne sometimes une victime once upon a time une sentinelle my pet mouse a male is une souris and king george vi was referred to as sa majesté he was not une brute
ive lived in france for almost  years ive never found the language unpleasant to listen to and i find nasal a very strange description of it
its not an editorial its a light hearted article
really most esl speakers ive talked to say its pretty easy with the only tricky points really being the nonphonetic spelling and the phrasal verbs i even had a french speaker claim it was a lot easier for him to learn than italian was which surprised me
the french first look if it has balls
language speakers dont really take much notice of the pronouncements of institutions when it comes to lang rules which is why all languages change adapt and evolve over time users own language not institutions
at least in this case the circumflex is necessary to distinguish sûr from sur
is this progressive or retrogressive transgressive
as long as french have fun with it

dont forget the space between the s of alors and your exclamation mark 
when i first came to the uk from nz i found the use of love and darling and whatnot really got my back up how insulting but i slowly came to realise that they werent generally used as a putdown shopkeepers bar tenders the person asking for directions by contrast i think in a professional situation the use of these terms is still unacceptable and quite often a deliberate way of demeaning people
im guilty of this i often call women love in my defence its because i have northern roots and that was a frequently used term interestingly i have heard many women using the word girls for a group of women
and i often here women describe former boyfriends as a bit of a bastard what are the rules
regina sponge
what do you call a group of your pupils
victoria sponge sounds vaguely sexist to me best to refer to it as a sovereign sponge to be on the safe side
its alright luv no one is likely to be relaxed enough around you to refer to you with a sexist term of endearment i suppose we should stop referring to groups of grown up men as the boys too i know you mean well but i dont think your view helps much
wait a second dear and love are both terms older women frequently use towards men the other day someone told me off for using the word feisty claiming that it was only used towards women and had negative connotations but again throughout literature feisty is often used to describe men and is generally used in a positive sense lively determined and courageous also are we allowed to use words like boisterous
first world problems
everybody round here calls each other lovei would be incredibly sad if the term faded out due to articles like this one girlsboys if that offends you im afraid youve lost the plot ive lately become confused by every article referencing actors as male and female i understand why totally but why do the oscars still have a best actress award surely they should all be in the same category
connotations of a giggling gang of teenagers i do think of that as mel and sues comic schtick
as a school teacher myself i learn my students names and just use them instead
is treacle ok
could we have the officially approved list then i dont want to be accused of wrongspeak
i refer to the men at work as the boys theyre all in their s they do not find this offensive amongst friends and colleagues terms of endearment are largely just that terms of endearment i dont even mind someone in the supermarket calling me love or pet because that too is a term of endearment theyre being friendly not try to patronise me a man shouted fat whore at me as i walked home from work last week i did object to that
maybe a victoria sponge too far on this one
alright luv
oh please
its ok as long as you fart beforehand got it
weve had this one already httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejulstopcallingwomengirlsitseitherpatronisingorsexuallysuggestive
how about guys what plural forms will the guardian allow
i actually have some sympathy for the individual referred to as dear darlin or love unless it is by a nurse or an elderly shopkeeper but boys and girls in the plural are how the opposite sexes commonly referred to each other in a jovial group sense be it at a weddingfamily function or a worklace training day
couldnt agree more in a sense he was expressing the very thing this artical rants about not that anti pc comments are bad more that he is aknowledging people do say stupid things and moreover perhaps deserve the right to reflect and perhaps realise this i agree with the ideas of language modelling and how we can contribute to a better sociaty by thinking a bit more about the power of our words i also reserve the right to say something stupid because quite frankly i am but human
youre wrong even where elements of pc are enshrined in law it is logical to expect politicians to be influenced by the culture around them if politicians were really the source they wouldnt be tripped up by it themselves so often i should know after all i am a leftist with a mildly authoritarian streak but my politics are very very far from being represented much in actual government and law
good articulate article im fed up with me partner being picked on for being different and my kids for heing half differentits always the middle class that whinge against pc for working class people we have always had immigrants and many of us are anyway
yes it does give us a break we can all read it and its pretty straightforward stuff please enough of this nonsense
gary oldman is an idiot but dont let that stop anybody from taking his complaints seriously and then being as the article says banal a useful instance for reflection yes all drunk celebrities are super useful to banal reflection in fact all news stories should start with celebrities right now merely  of them do we have to do better fight for equality by talking more about famous people thats what i say man the barricades the ones around the red carpet and never take your eyes off the limo
our world has gone to hell declared gary oldman in a recent interview with playboy magazine these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman but he did not exactly say that did he and so not reporting exactly what he said and the sentiments behind it you show yourself to be someone who ignores the truth and prefers to obsfucate what has been said for your own meansi will remember your name for the future and out in the do not believe anything this person writes
nonsense leftist pc is now enshrined in english and eu law its assuredly a government imposition of a culture it is a secularised replacement for christian ideas around the dignity of humanity
i dont think the poster wasnt suggesting that she should not enjoy those rights and freedoms i think thats exactly what the post suggests whether it was meant is open to debate suggesting she should either stfu or somehow only make positive noises because of the freedoms britain provides her with seems pretty straightforward and then the posters repeats the same meme because yaz chooses to live in britain which was created by white folk i mean dear me
the delegate sitting next to me put up their hand and said in such a context there is nothing unpc about identifying the sex of the person concerned maybe they forgot or just couldnt tell
and yet if you wrap us your intolerance in religion it will be aggressively defended atl at cif
well im going to exercise that freedom of speech and say that everyone who voted for ukip is selfish and racist oooh you are brave i hope you dont end up in the tower for treason or something
i call this patriotic correctness
people in pubs are often rude to each other particularly in drink why should rudeness to some sections of society be more weighted than others reality is that we can all with a misplaced comment look or laugh cause offence to someone looking for trouble some pubs attract rougher clientele than others avoid the dodgy ones is my advice
how come that seldom applies to the bigotry in religion
why has everyone who expressed the opinion that multiculturalism might not be right for every county everywhere all the time been called a racist im unaware that this is true so ukip are the creation of the pc brigade and theres me thinking they have been harping on about being antieu since  with no great successuntil they decided to go fullon antiimmigration in  and crossed a fairly obvious line at times who in the pc brigade is only indignant about racism as you suggest
not really many sites use a word checker that automatically deletes a post if an offending word is found
im all for political correctness as many other posters have pointed out it is with some exceptions just a case of being polite there is a big big difference being polite has always been a choice however being unpc can mean losing your job or landing in court
i think your post is complete bollocks
bullshit its just politeness and respect for others if its just politeness why are the words negro and coloured people which were once considered perfectly polite vide naacp now condemned as politicall incorrect it is an attempt to control language and by changing the terms of reference making it more difficult for outsiders to discuss particular issues its got nothing to do with marxism its an attempt to control the terms of discussion you can see it at work politically in terms like bedroom tax versus spare room subsidy
one usually dines with like minded people though doesnt one mate
good post king penda its the massive hypocrisy about these so called forbidden words that gets on my wick
so it is being confronted thats all i said
facts are sacred but comment especially atl is usually factfree
ethical considerations concerning medical procedures or mutilations without a physical justification is a kind of a public discourse you cannot rule out can you by your logic all surgery is mutilation and of course that is not the case antitrans people are bigoted period
whereas once condemning sexist and racist language and behaviour was a commendable endeavour it is now a pejorative shorthand for oversensitivity and nonsense whose fault is that its the fault of the author and people like her with their incessant bleating about imagined sexism and racism if theyd only reserve their moaning for the small number of genuine cases they might find people a bit more receptive
you mean that uri oldman is not russian
political correctness and other attempts to restructure language artificially have failed because you cannot impose the changes that are mentally demanded as a brief example the term special needs is now frequently used as term of abuse
so do you want the people expressing their disgust or whatever at oldmans actorly confusions which remember were not just held but printed and no doubt paid for so much for censorship are having disagreeable opinions do you want to put a stop to them if not what exactly is your point
when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots yeah well some peopleactually grow up and dont get into rages gary problem solved
the view of political correctness as humourless language policing is so normalised it can be used as a cover for bigoted language i agree to an extent but sometimes the guardian moderators strengthen the argument of those who hold this view by being rather too keen to delete comments they dont approve of id rather have the racists out in the open personally
political correctness i would say didnt really exist as a concept before the eighties but i never never heard my parents using a racist word however its quite likely at that time that your parents would use words like negro or coloured which at the time were perfectly polite but have now been declared poltically incorrect and people are censured for using them
he was absolutely compelled to get on his knees and beg forgiveness when his comment about jews controlling hollywood caused the shite to hit the fan and he came under attack from the adl etc for perceived antisemitism if he ever wanted to work again this mea maxima culpa was required
you are taking the term too literally if anything politicians tend to lag behind what is pc pc is a cultural thing rather than a governmental thing
political correctness is just another word for politeness and i should imagine most of us were bought up to think being polite is a good thing whats wrong with using words that are offensive its wrong because its impolite using such language is oafish i dont use racist or sexist language because i think being polite is actually important and a good thing
unlike a lot of people on this thread it seems i dont believe that there is any possible justification to what gary oldman said but he doesnt represent any countervailing bigotry he has marked himself as being so out there that he is now unemployable in a mainstream film because reasonable minded people will avoid him in the same way they would avoid a mel gibson film he doesnt represent any backlash just a solitary island of bitter prejudice most people would never think the things that he said and therefore are in no danger of ever saying them no matter how drunk
i said it earlier but its worth saying again because its an obvious fact that nonetheless gets ignored all societies at all times have some form of political correctness the daily mailtypes who selfpityingly whinge about the supposed oppression of pc gone mad tend to hark nostalgically back to the good ol days when one could call a spade a spade a time when you were literally actually censored if you swore in print or broadcast when homosexuals were not just not allowed to talk about themselves honestly but went to gaol if the were found out when interviewers grovelled obsequiously to governments and noone was allowed to mention sex or swear whats that if not a different form of pc gone mad i challenge any of the woe is me im cruelly im censored crowd to find any time or place when you could say as much about pretty much anything as you can now endlessly complaining that you cant say this that or the other in response to the reaction to someone saying exactly this that or the other publicly in print is not just disingenuous but idiotic its not censorship its someone challenging something bigoted or stupid that you said if you dont like that tough its called freespeech funnily enough
the person writing this article would probably firmly agree with police spending half of their time trawling social networking sites for offences against language huh the police will look into your complaint if your neighbour is posting abusive messages about your daughter or your mum on facebook would you thank me for suggesting that the police should let you sort your own trivial problems out
i think this might be a case for the guardian readers editor to take a look at as it does seem to be deliberate misrepresentation
is it nice being free of control but when you dine out and speak your mind does anyone ever threaten to punch your lights out
people having their own disagreeable opinions somebody needs to put a stop to this
political correctness is a phrase which simply describes one application of what we used to know as politeness this stemmed from having enough self respect to respect others true but pc gone mad is something else it is a synonym for malice deliberately mising or distorting someones words in order to make them appear racisthomophobicunpatriotic etc when the original statements were nothing of the kind you cannot judge language independent of its context and tone
political correctness is dead long live the thought police
god i hope not political correctness is about control control of thought processes and attitudes by those like miss okolosie who would have everyone conform to a political dogma not a moral standard not me thanks you may bugger off out of my head
rap music has played a large part in normalising the term nigger to people brought up programmed to think that there is no such thing as race when you have people of european origins criticised for using the term which is all over mtv and the music and film media it looks like you attack someone because of who they are rather than what they said in this case oldman is off message for the neoliberal thought police and so he is castigated and mised for putting forward an opinion or maybe just musing on some thoughts about what he feels he experiences in hollywood someone who is on message or trendy with the hollywood and us liberal establishment like tarantino gets praise for littering his dialogue with all manner of racial slurs probably because it proliferates the favoured liberal narrative on race and politics in the us proportionality and a bit less hysteria would help a great deal however this kind of badly misrepresented article is largely a symbol of why the establishment left is so regressive and cultish only chanting the same old dogmatic slogans to each other in some massive circle jerk
thats actorist
as tony h has hopefully told him its an honest program best of luck gary every cripple to his own way of walking
except that sophistry doesnt mean the shouting down of debate and individuals
what is needed is a rejection of the anodyne compromise that political correctness has become i agree one of the effects of it is that the point of what oldman was saying gets completely ignored ie in effect that the anodyne compromise that pc has become turns us all into hypocrites and all the pc brigade can see is what he said by way of examples about how some people refer to other ethnicreligious groups the wider point being that we all have at least at some time harboured or voiced what would probably be in pc terms unacceptable ideas or language so to be getting all puffed up and self righteous when someone else is perceived to have done the same is just hypocrisy the correct response to these propositions is to examine whether they are true or not or to what extent etc and respond accordingly not castigate the speaker and have him apologise and shut up in future and forevermore lest he utter a taboo word what he said pretty much accords with what is needed is a rejection of the anodyne compromise that political correctness has become the irony
hi i read the article look at this from para  these days people wont take a simple joke about being a nigger or a fucking jew according to oldman its considered bad form to name women especially those in positions of power fucking useless cunts and when in a rage you cant even call gay men faggots its not exactly thin end of the wedge stuff your few naughty words this is deliberately seeking to bully or psychologically wound other people because of ways in which they are different to gary oldman he of the magnificently white skin the proud and proudly uncut member between the legs and the superior sexual preference its not even anywhere near every bit of your life totallitarianism at least not half as much as the alternative which you clearly endorse would be which is that if you are in a wheelchair or are black youve bloody well got to smile along when funny aquietnight and his friends call you a monkey or a spazz
we can live safe in the knowledge that the person writing this article would probably firmly agree with police spending half of their time trawling social networking sites for offences against language
he seems to be arguing with himself id leave him to get on with it if i were you
i wrote about socalled political correctness some time ago herehttpwwwhuffingtonpostcoukalastairroderickindefenceofpoliticalc_b_html attacks on an allpervasive thought police are usually made by someone whinging about how they are the last oppressed minority because they are not allowed to make jokes about others completely ignoring the fact that truly great comedy is on the side of the oppressed not on the side of the bully and certainly not on the side of the mildly inconvenienced btw pc is not synonymous with the left there is a rightwing political correctness too the monarchy armed forces the idea that business is anything other than benevolent these are all above reproach and criticism is met with the same lack of humour the jeremy clarksons of the world assume is characteristic of the looniestleft black lesbian disabled social worker
actually its quite possible to be a zionist without being jewish lots of nonjews are zionists while many jews are not so of course it is possible to criticise zionism without criticising jews as jews
the problem is not so much social consequences as the consequences for private individuals with limited resources suddenly confronted with the amassed and aligned resources of militant minorities used to intimidate and repress views they prefer not to have to engage with in open debate  define militant how can a minority intimidate and repress in our society or is it just being a dick when you spout hatred and prejudice you mentioned minorities as if to be in a minority is somehow a bad thing why   how can minorities galvanize amass as you say and still be described disparagingly as minorites insignificant as far as your concerned which minorities galvanize together to oppress you which minorities piss you off more to the point is it all of them
i find many of these pc terms to be perfectly cromulent words
the damage inflicted and being inflicted on this country by the radical left hilarious the nhs is in danger we have the worst inequality in the industrial world apart from the us our kids dont have jobs but lets blame people who have never been near power
you are supposed to feel guilty if you have a  oz soda instead of a somewhat acceptable  oz by their rights you should be having a glass of water sorry was that a joke when parents try to stop their children smoking its yet more politically corectness imposed on them by left wing nazis you cant take assault rifles into conservative hq and shoot up posters of john major while dressed up as jimmy saville and singing praise for the killers of lee rigby yet more left wing nanny state pc mind control in a world gone topsy turvy
i guess most people do know how to use irony to take the piss out of the pc gone mad brigade
just because a few jobsworthsvips at the daily mail have decided whats offensive it means apparently were not allowed to say what hell we want must be a wet dream for the wannabe nazis working for the daily mail group more proof churchill was right innit
did you hear the one about person a person b and person c
i commend the mcgb for its stance a bit late in the day given the tens of thousands of fgms that have been carried out in britain but to borrow a phrase from another religion joy in heaven at the repenting sinner and all that 
who defines what culture should be the guardian
the other reason ukip has done well is that it is seen as distinct from the other parties who are more or less entirely composed of the professional political classes who have never known life outside university pr journalism and the party machinery ie the westminster bubble the political classes are fanatically intolerant of anyone whose views are not on message so just by challenging that ukip win a few hearts and minds terrible prejudice on racial religious and cultural grounds exist between minority groups in britain mirroring various places around the world eg hindu caste system tamil v singhalese middle eastern religious intolerance african tribal clashes etc etc occasionally these tensions make headlines eg the terrible murder of damilola taylor most often they are ignored by the press yab included to give her her due occasionally she speaks out against sharia law and its effect on women more of the same please yab as your bete noir rod liddle said shame there arent more muslim feminists
well written hope those fuckers didnt track change it to death too much lola
there can be hope for humanity so two gay men are minding their own business in a leeds pub and four youngsters can come in and overturn the established rules by being rude and this to you would be hope for humanity so exactly when would you like me to start calling your daughter that slag over there
it is and always was far less to do with politics than with commonsense societal good behaviourat the heart of this is not saying a few naughty words or a tactless joke it is the extremism of the pc crowd that extends beyond language and into every bit of your life down to the point you are supposed to feel guilty if you have a  oz soda instead of a somewhat acceptable  oz by their rights you should be having a glass of waterthese little totalitarians want more then a pleasant good morning as a greeting and that is what makes them so repulsive
yep spot on many thanks
he apologised to try and avoid being persecuted and excluded from employment for discussing opinions that are now viewed as illegitimate by powerful forces in society
yab might have had few options at the time of the expulsion though as i understand it she might have chosen the subcontinent nowadays she has the rest of europe to choose from under eu rules as well britain gave her sanctuary and the right of free expression funny how she despises the place not saying it isnt her right i just find it odd its my right of free expression to say my partner is an awful person theyre not btw but if so it would be a bit odd for me to stay with them if i did 
we can say what we like and we dont need the guardian and its ilk telling us what we can or cannot say if people say something offensive the natural response to such statements should prevent a repeat
recalcitrant resistance to what it is really about a wish to root civility and fairness in society will only continue to sound as wornout as oldmans rehashed antisemitic stereotypes all i see is selective ing people taking things literally when that is clearly not the intention and twisting words to make a trap for fools as kipling put it this is not about making a fairer society this is about destroying the lives of good people because you dislike them
one of the problems with political correctness is that it fails to realize that reality also constructs language and even your attempts at reconstruction come up with as many new words to describe say an ethnic group suffering from prejudice every one of them will take on the negative connotations of the prevailing culture over time and need to be replaced
not sure what any of this has to do with the left in particular think pretty much everyone in the uk uses terms like girlfriend and boyfriend still do right wing gay men want me calling them faggots in a restaurant pretty fucking sure they dont
i was aware of it in the s it used to be called ideological soundness and was a far left construct good manners are not enforced by law but by an agreed set of standards that are broadly respected by members of society regardless of class we now live in a society whose notion of diversity is that some parts of society can use words and ideas such as the n word or religious even racial supremacy whilst the majority community can be prosecuted through the courts for using the same words or ideas
pc does encroach freedom of speech you expunge prejudicediscrimination by intellect and not via supposition think paul robeson and clr james et al
like the passage ed by rod liddle in his book that they mentioned in the clip which started it all or like the passage ed by owen jones in his book on chavs of course she should enjoy the rights and freedoms all british people enjoy including the free speech she isnt always keen on others having but its incongruous that she should so relentlessly attack white british when it is they who created the country in which she prefers to live its a bit like me moving to singapore and enjoying the low crime rate and wellordered society whilst endlessly attacking the singaporeans for anything and everything in yab fashion
not a decade ago but getting on for  years what precisely do you think there is to debate these debates have already been had rehashing them with nothing new to bring to light seems redundant thats not protecting a pc pet thats acknowledging that a debate would only serve by those who would have their flat out wrong beliefs as being equivalent to a position settled for decades i mean its a bit like asking slavery good or bad
its a little disturbing to me the extent to which she has misrepresented what he said if i had read this without first having read his actual comments i would have come to a totally erroneous conclusion about them
yeah she was rather horrid mick jagger the other week saying that a man his age shouldnt have a  or whatever yearold girlfriend espesh as his former didnt die that long ago frankly none of yabs business
they mark the points at which we can openly discuss how far we have yet to go what often happens is an eyerolling harrumph about the pc police basically you are seeing a reconstruction of the victorian value system with an endless array of s version of you cant do that you cant say thisit would not surprise me at all if the generation following the millennials start uprooting this rigid pc social system and start acting down right rude after endless chastisement during their upbringingthere can be hope for humanity
well if you do find yourself in a situation where it is fine to hurl racist abuse then why not whats the worst that could happen
i see and hear people coming out with daft threats all the time because i hang around with drinkers unfortunately some of the threatening behaviour translates into action fabricant as an mp knows better then to joke about hitting women or he should do hitting women does nothing for anyone
maybe but honestly who the heck has never said something that shouldnt have been said i dont think ive ever used a racial slur but the other day lost my temper badly and told my daughter she was being a little shit totally inappropriate and i wasnt even drunk
but had to live through marriage being destroyed by the left your marriage was destroyed by the left all marriages were destroyed by the left the right didnt do anything to destroy marriage the right didnt do anything
precisely as earlier noted the public changing mood has the historical cultural scientific etc value as the question about why people used to perceive a notion of flat earth ten thousands of article if not more have been written about the causes for the copernicus revolution and many more would be added in the future equally a change that just a decade ago led to a criminal conviction and an enforced castration evokes no less important debate all the more so given the relative approaches towards it around the world and even within the british society unless you adopt the writers view that the pcs pets are privileged and must be treated differently
no not been forced to have a gay marriage but had to live through marriage being destroyed by the left your marriage was destroyed by the left thats terrible cant quite understand how it could have happened but im sure youre right
in my experience those that throwup their hands and bemoan the fact they cannot say nigger or fucking jew anymore in any context are typically both a bit thick and are the type of person who blames their problems on anyone but themselves ie if not immigrants then catholics if not blacks then irish etc etc
language crime is just a small step towards thought crime thats some crazy logic youve got going on there thought crime is explicitly crime that you only think about but never enact thought crime is that category of crime that is entirely inside and never leaves the imagination of the nonperp saying something is an action saying something makes it leave the head and enter the outside world your beef seems to be about whether the thing is petty or not well guess what the term petty crime exists for that incidentally bully for you for not minding being called paki and queer i think that your requirement that everybody else be equally calm about being insulted is a greater legal imposition than requiring people to simply watch what they say would you draw the line to the left or the right of calling a paraplegic yearold a flid
once it was about recognising that language has the power to construct reality as do social structures its almost an aside but i think this is a singularly important point that most people have either forgotten or possibly more likely never knew
usa cant use the word coloured for a black south africa coloured is a recognised racial designation yes in south africa coloured is a specific racial group it doesnt mean black south african which is a different racial group in the us the word coloured to describe african americans is viewed as derogatory and your point is
ice cube and his cohort in nwa can use the n word from now till doomsday giving no offence but that doesnt give some cow poke from the wilds of gloucestershire or white south london to go round thinking he is part of the ghetto unless he is of course which oldman aint
gary stepped in it and then put his foot in his mouth he should know better whats the alternative political incorrectness calling people derogatory names is not acceptable i never heard anybody called offensive names at my home when i was a child my children did not hear that sort of language and neither do their children derogatory speech may be more the custom of the people who are basically insecure in one way or another and feel threatened by the other some of the most homophobic people i ever encountered turned out to be gay and came out years later its pathetic really oldman is a good actor he should probably not do interviews and hollywood is run by corporations
it doesnt have to be offensive language in that sense everyone has said things they didnt really believe lashed out in anger in order to hurt someone with words done something hypocritical said something drunk they wouldnt have sober if anyone has experienced anything like this they should really be able to extrapolate using their imagination to other kinds of situations where another person has done something similar we dont really know what was going on in the head of the clearly falling apart mentally mel gibson but we should be able to imagine something about what that might be like and then we should probably say there but for the grace of god go i and leave it be
its now very common to hear people say im rather offended by that as if that gives them certain rights its actually nothing moreits simply a whine its no more than a whine i find that offensive it has no meaning it has no purpose it has no reason to be respected as a phrase i am offended by that well so fucking what stephen fry fry is right here that is not a problem with being pc in itself however it is a problem with people misunderstanding what it is all for the individual finding whatever offensive is i think misunderstanding the purpose of ruling certain epithets out of bounds it is not about the word in itself but as it says atl a way of challenging particular power structures which are backed up by prejudice if it increases politeness then i suppose thats relatively harmless but i dont think that was ever the end point of the exercise the person who says i am offended by that would say if they understood what you just said is part of a system of oppression and by using that systems language you are implicitly supporting it
phew
schools solved this problem years ago with the use of parentguardian on permission slips
there is nothing wrong with a heterosexual twoparent monoracial family thanks for clarifying that for us
sexism is like racism homophobia or xenophobia you will see it everywhere if that is your intention as this writer plainly intends yes he does and hes come up with a pointless and vaguely desperate article it would only have a purpose if the english language was unique in having pejorative words to describe women
spinster in the modern day isnt a negative word lonely old spinster is along with lonely old bachelor
your example doesnt stand up because it reveals another inequality a wronged man is a figure of fun in the same way as a man beaten by his girlfriend is a figure of fun it is terrible for the person involved and not funny at all but the historical humour comes from the fact that men are strong and should be able to control their women if they fail they are weak and can be laughed at the norm is male power and those that fall short can be ridiculed the female example is different a wronged women is a passive victim of male action she isnt expected to do anything about it she hasnt failed in her role she hasnt moved from the feminine norm of weakness and so it isnt funny the inherent problem for everyone is that men have to be leaders and women have to be submissive if we move away from those norms we have sissies pansies harridans nags scolds and much worse cuckold is just another example
fascinating and sad
reminds me of that dictionary scene from malcolm x
i did over and over again until i got it right i thank you
you odsplut
i guess bias against an ideology is fine if you share bias against that ideology
why would an english speaking journalist working for an english language newspaper write an article about the evolution of particular words in zulu it wouldnt be of interest to many readers i guess on the plus side it wouldnt result in the all these idiotic kneejerk comments that seem to be along the lines of har har bloody guardian  lefty theyre going to abolish my words
manwomanwomen prefer to be called wolets start the reform
interestingword and name capture kidnap slut is of course a untidy women doesnt do the housework etc but whats the male version a male who is untidy and disheveled why its a corbyn
not sure i even accept that all he does is point out that language isnt the problem if we find sexism or misogyny its because it is there in society and the article barely even refers to feminism other than in the initial example on which he is quite measured
just in case you have read the article and really didnt understand it the point is that the words chosen did not start off as pejoratives they became pejorative the argument goes because words that are associated with women in a position of authority or freedom from male authority become limited either to authority in a sexual setting or pejorative or both thus male chauvinist pig would only be an equivalent if it had once been a neutral or positive term and if the behaviour it condemned was seen as masculine rather than merely boorish though this is much better expressed in the article so i suggest you read it again also very few people the term male chauvinist pig unironically as opposed to the masses of people who imagine it spurtling forth from the strawfeminist dommes of their fevered imaginations

dutch courage is not an insult to the dutch but refers to english mariners needing a few drinks before daring the walk across the wooded dunes from den haag to scheveningen where robbers lay in wait here are a couple of alternative origins httpwwwhistoryextracomqadutchcourage
wanton and brazen is best though if theres a choice
none of the examples you cite has undergone a slide from a standard english meaning into a derogatory meaning the meaning of boy to refer to a juvenile has not changed it has by extension been used for other purposes some to belittle others to indicate comradeship or group solidaritykeep trying
the history bit is interesting its the conclusion of therefore sexism that is the problem also we cannot consider the article in isolation there was the article yesterday and the complaining about the dictionary before that as well
its a bit shaky if you have to go on what you think hes implying and even then acknowledge he isnt implying abolition to be fair the emer otoole article was less measured than this one and id accept more criticism of that though even there i think its not about abolition of politically wrong words just about advocating care in the usage of language on these issues
its not really a surprise that language can be loaded with connotations that change over time i remember the times when diversity was a neutral purely descriptive expression or multicultural
what does louche mean
you arent new to verbal jousting are you well done david
i have to say her grasp of wittgenstein was pretty poor we can at least agree on that on some levels agree with the way that you have described her position political correctness can indeed go mad but on the other hand the fact we no longer feel its ok to describe people as poofters ners and so on has to some degree been part of a remaking of a slightly more tolerant society one can argue about causation and about how far to take this but on a basic level i think care with language is just about manners and respect
before it became a buzzword to be reported on in the guardian i had called men and women bossy as well as been called bossy if i seemedyou knowbossythis is kinda like how loads of guardian articles and their like suggest that people use the phrase boys will be boys to excuse rapists which i have never ever seen interestingly if you google the phrase boys will be boys you get a mumsnet page about climbing trees and then dozens of articles from opinion writers bemoaning this fictional trend
it is indeed i just couldnt find a good translation into english of the epigraph to nikolai gogols the government inspector which hits the nail really
picking one book to confirm your own prejudices is hardly the sign of a balanced argument of you were studying for a degree and told your tutor that your conclusions were based on reading one book theyd dump your essay in the bin
language reflects the realities of life through the ages male dominance and gender specific roles even more true in other languages across the world
but we speak english rather than latin and as the article aptly explained the meaning of words can change over time
a lot of people fail to see the difference between merely highlighting a relatively minor issue and exaggerating it i dont see a call to arms here no one is suggesting we burn dictionaries or even rewrite them a lot of people also fail to appreciate that a relatively harmless symptom can be the result of social attitudes and that if there is a problem it is not really that the dictionary says rabid feminist but the underlying attitudes and assumptions that lead to that im pretty quick to dismiss articles that try to make a nonissue into a huge problem and it is especially a problem with feminism but this article is about language as much as feminism and i find it quite interesting too
a thcentury word meaning a female infant or a young unmarried woman quickly acquired negative connotations from the late th century in langland and chaucer it is used to mean a wanton woman a mistress indeed how intolerably sexist it is that a word means the same thing that it has meant for more than  years someone really ought to have a stern word with this chaucer fellow and explain that he doesnt live up to st century standards
i think there is a social bias against women not as extreme as some seem to think exists but bad enough which goes back a long way and is reflected in the language however of the examples given above i would argue that the only one where the oedoup are displaying sexism is rabid with the other words the change occurred socially a long while ago tart seems to be the most recent shift and the relevant examples are going to show that cultural bias it would certainly seem to imply the language has veered at least a bit toward sexism against women but thats because the society which birthed them veered toward sexism against women theres also the issue of derogatory words used exclusively of men excess of testosterone is often used to explain extreme male displays and i cant think of a female equivalent does gigolo courtesan why does pimp seem worse than madam as a noun but acceptable in some subcultures as an adjective a little balance would be helpful
macho man invariably used ironically to mockboy in reference to an adult man is patronizing or a reference to servitude whereas girl is used in many different wayscock dick wanker dickhead man upgrow a pair now someone is going to side step that these words refer to men by suggesting that its not as bad as the dreadful female counterparts little do they know that they are perpetuating the stereotype that women need protection from mean words but men can handle it
the university of warwick article supported activists in preventing someone from speaking at the university who might further inflame discrimination and bullying of muslims it was a fair call it was not about progressive islam it was about speaking out against islam as a religion and it was felt by those who lodged the protest that in light of already fractious and difficult circumstances for muslims it would be better the speech not be made now you might argue this infringes free speech but free speech is not a free for all respect and responsibility including understanding the social context in which youre speaking is important re the nawaz article i have responded to kevster above but suffice to say opposing one exradicals particular approach to deradicalisation which there is much evidence against it has to be said does not equate to an attack on them or on the concept of reform itself
but actor is masculine for purely grammatical reasons btw apparently there was a latin word actrix but theres no record of it meaning actress just stewardess or fem plaintiff ltltltthey cannot be actors for anatomical reasons
he really made a balls up of this article still maybe he isnt feeling too well theres a lot of man flu going around at the moment cant really blame him for feeling rough what with living under the eurocentric patriarchy and all
french and spanish languages have masculine and feminine nouns to say businesswoman in chinese you have to say female businessman wouldnt surprise me if english is one of the least sexist languages in the world
the dictionary reflects the usage thats rather the point of a dictionary if youre aware the usage has changed why would you be surprised that the dictionary has too
surely the writers intention is to ask why have the meaning of these words become more negative and the point being made is that it is because sexism and misogyny are deeply ingrained in traditional esp patriarchal thinking so deeply in fact that we see it revealed by most of the comments even in its mildest form of dismissal as irrelevant to the commenter
language evolved over time also rabid feminist was used by a female feminist so was womanmade surely that should be celebrated in the guardian
but i really dont understand the virulent reaction to this artice theyve probably read the other  or so articles about the oed and just cant take any more
your laughter seems hollowalmost bitteryou maybe want to watch that those men will all pass you by
thats an old one to be sure 
why choose feminist over say rightwinger communist or fan though put it through googles ngrams rightwinger does not come up at all fan is way ahead of feminist and communist is even rarer
we have reached peak guardian
the content of the article has been known for a long time at least in academic circles for example both wife and girl used to be applied to both males and females they were gradually applied only to females and at least in the case of girl acquired pejorative meanings eg you runthrowhit like a girl the notion that language reflects social attitudes and particularly the attitudes of the people who decide how it is to be used is common sense for much of history the people who wrote dictionaries and determined usage fowlers modern english usage anyone indeed the people who could write at all where mostly male so how can anyone be surprised that english reflects some longstanding attitudes towards women the sticking point appears to be when people openly object to some traditional usages that is when they try to join in the determination of usage hence a large number of comments on the article with responses such as this subject is not important that would be demonstrated by echoing silence not  pages of comments no whataboutery usage isnt a problem look at that shiny problem over there it happens to men too noticing social influences on language means that the noticers are determined to police everybodys speech everywhere as part of building a totalitarian state people calm down really where does the article propose or even imply any of that another nice demonstration of lewis law dictionary definition httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermlewislaw
she also mentioned male stupidity which im guessing is somehow different than stupidity regardless its always refreshing to see blatant sexism in a comment about how bad sexism is
rabid leftwingers
and then change it to o
bachelor for spinster more like dirty old man or pedo far worse than spinster
why dont you add them here a list of male terms that used to be equal to their female counterpart but are now used to denigrate
expunged i love itplease give me more how fantastic and on a rainy wednesdayexpungement expungent expungification expungee
brazen surely
im british and in my s i accept that manageress along with words such as authoress may have been more common in your grandparents era but i have never heard it used it would certainly sound very odd indeed and more than faintly sexist in reference to a current situation i havent even come across it to my memory in novels by the time it was common for women to be managers referring to professional women with the ess suffix was dying out
look up pedant
can we not use the word posh or ascribe language to social statusok then
i dunno i reckon a feminist can really only be a female and that the men who say they are this are either deluded or trying to entice a modern female into their bed how about a new word for men who proclaim to be feminists femenists kind of taken already by those halfnaked ukrainian tarts with flowers in their hairfehehehemenistoscan noone fix this one
bint is a respectable term in arabic but not in english bimbo is a respectable word in italianit just means male child
im finding it hard to think of any words that are used to describe men which have undergone similar pejoration what examples did you have in mind
to all those who are accusing the writer of this article of being a wee bit selective with his examples i recommend dale spenders book man made language where there are many more examples and in depth discussion on this issue it convinced me
welcome to politically correct new speak we will soon only be allowed to say something is double plus good or double plus bad in proper ingsoc newspeak it is double plus ungood
when did you go to school 
we had a fascinating thread going about selective reporting and media prioritisies above sadly it has been nixed i wish some tech head would setup a way to restore deleted comments
a few articles examining how wealthy women guardian journalists for instance only relate to working class women on the basis of hiring them to do their drudgery for them might be better than this dreck
i dont have a lot of time for modern feminists but i really dont understand the virulent reaction to this artice i found it quite interesting i guess the main question is is this a highly selective and biased choice of examples in order to peddle a certain opinion or is it a general truth that the language veers towards sexism against women
entirely different use of words of course
racism homophobia transphobia fat shaming its literally all in there
why not right winger or communist so youre fine with describing a proponent of an ideology as rabid so long as its not your ideologyyou shouldnt show your hand all at once
indeed and we were accepting its use by girls it was its use by boys that was under debate
once again can someone explain to me why the phrase rabid feminist is in any way sexist a feminist can be a man or a woman or anything in between and proponents of absolutely any ideology can be rabid also what were the sexist definitions that this article mentions it was only the usage of the words that caused controversy
may i suggest that you are confusing men with people who give a shit
how about the capital letter i also david surely this blatant phallic form should be immediately expunged from the english language
interesting article and if were decent human beings than our language should reflect that but of the eight words chosen theres nothing i can see thats insulting apart from hussy and tart and how many people use those terms anyway id argue theyre probably on the wane looking at it from a male perspective although im not a bloke the term bastard is generally used to describe a man one thinks little of when its original term was to describe a child born out of wedlock its also similar phonetically to the egyptian goddess bastet is there a link if so it would be a tenuous one but bastardbastet is an example of how david shariatmadaris principles can be applied to all genders or groups
seeing at how many men enjoy denigrating women socially and through their media not sure where the author gets his hope from 
apparently in the past confirmed bachelor indicated gaiety
i think you have seen the answers of other commentators and of course for more examples you could ask female friends
i remember reading wench in thomas hardy i think it was the mill on the floss where wench is used to refer to a young girl so not always with negative connotations
i believe the term feminist used to have serious meaning cant be having that in a society that now resists all meaningful progressive change
great example of male stupidity make mine a blue razor blade
haha all these men in this comment section who try to make this article about themselves again all the injustices they perceive against them its all about them apparently
not so sure about that he does the usual thing of conflating any perceived criticism of feminism with misogyny feminism is an ideology not a gender after all
of course there are absolutely no words in the english language that are attributable as insults to men are there what kind of narrow minded blinkered world do you live in
i think youre right that its hit a nerve but maybe wrong about which nerve its hit
eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the english language youve really done nothing more than show us  words with usage that has changed from positiveneutral to negative are there no words describing men that have changed in a similar way im not suggesting that there are any im simply suggesting that you have not made your case until youve shown this has only happened for words describing women or that it has happened significantly more often to words that describe women until then this has simply been an interesting lesson in the change in use of a few words
master in the form you are talking about never replaced the other definition though so i wouldnt agree that it was a reduction in status it also never became lower in status than the female form its also pretty old fashioned now men of all ages are really just referred to as mr whereas women are miss until they marry and become mrs thats why people use ms because miss is seen as if not derogatory then still a reference to being defined by your marriage
margaret thatcher katy hopkins
totalstrangers point and i suspect you know it was they were highlighting the fact we hadnt moved in language you listing of the transformation in circumstances for women socially ignores this thread is primarily concerning itself with language use totalstranger even es chomsky your motives are suspect
wenches should always be buxom and a hussy isnt a true hussy unless shes wanton
do you use the word exclusively to describe girls does anyone here instead of saying i once heard a girl called bossy so its only used about girls does anyone here think that the word only means an excessively controlling girl rather than an excessively controlling person
rabid i didnt think anyone would be brave enough to suggest guardian
bad example those words all have multiple uses arent derogatory in nature and they arent words which of themselves are associated exclusively with women youve just provided examples of sentences that focus on men given away entirely by the fact that every sentence contains he man etc you can remove all references to he him man and it becomes impossible to know what gender the sentences refer to theyre very uncooperative and aggressivethey were a depraved person who had abused their two young daughtersetc the words in the article are used exclusively about women and are all entirely derogatory and dont have other meanings or uses outside the derogatory use against women you can take the words entirely out of context spinster hussy tart etc and instantly know that its referring to a woman
the dictionary is a mirror of societyno use breaking the mirror its necessary to reform societymoreover the problem isnt really the wordeverything is context
queen used to mean woman so became elevated and specialised i think this disproves the sexist claims of the article
yeah with all that terrible misandry men only earn more than women because of their inherent genius b

funny the guardian has loads of articles about serious stuff so how come you found the time to read and comment on this one
yeah but we all know the most offensive one
i also havent seen articles about why christianity is so homophobic and why its supports slavery
oh and re mistress it was part of petrarchan language to describe the female object of male affections we slowly lost the marvellous leman for that women used lord in this way too so its transfer to refer to the corresponding party in an adulterous liaison is not such a large step particularly as mrs stepped into the breach to refer the the wife of the master
what a load of white knight bollocks
sorry posted by accident meant to finish withbut its not opposite to being in the white but the red so would that indicate a hierarchy of racism or a just be a coincidence
gay seems to have changed its meaning again my students use it to describe things that are a bit lame or generally rubbish my mum says it means cheerful or brightly coloured
to be fair a lot of derogatory terms which were only used for women ive heard being slung at men too calling each other tarts slags and fannies in banter and jest maybe theyve become terms of endearment in a way
tart is used more often to describe men than women in my experience
and as for rabid i think the vast majority of population at least the ones who can speak english would probably first associate it with dog
as far as put down words are concerned english is a remarkable language having just about every tool in the box my is fave is strumpet a fantastic word sadly under used
one of the points of oxford dictionaries part of oxford university press oup is to show how words are used in the real world the author did not disagree and highlights it in the article that was not the point of the article

anyone who thinks to control a language as rich and diverse as english is on a fools errand further leftist pc attempts to outlaw words or expressions are not going to get much headway either the language will evolve as it sees fit
desperate attempts to be offended tend to make one look like a bit of a knob male inspired pejorative
no one uses spinster any more alas its been replaced by catlady
still use wench as a slang term in the black country its not really derogatory though and ive not me many who take offence at it
you never hear a woman called a dick a twàt a nobend a prîck a wànker a fùckwit an âsshole a shîthead a bästard or a tôsser i think their list is rather twee
that post says to be more about you issues than the validity of the argument
it hasnt yet occurred to us that making an insane song and dance over the fact that the word rabid was once placed next to feminism might actually reflect something of a fanatical obsession with feminism and policing the way it is perceived policing by whom the feminists or the antifeminists who seek to undermine feminism by associating it with pejorative adjectives such as rabid i think the great majority of this policing you speak of is done by the latter group and this is where the usage comes from
im yet to see an article about why islam is so misogynistic i suppose the english language is an easy target its not going to behead anyone for having a go at it
another great patron of the age of victim puts pen to paper  use these until you have found your own again

there are plenty of pejorative terms for men as well bastardwankerdickheadguardian reader
not to mention the strumpets of yore nor the neiges dantan
im sure its not just words for women that make the pejorative journey how about churl originally just a word for someone who made their living on the land ie a peasant but thats been pejorated too now a rude and meanspirited person and of course gay which we blithely promoted as a positive word for homosexual much to the older generations annoyance is now being used by youngsters to mean something like feeble or ineffective i cant complain about that too much though because naff was originally gay slang for straight
im a proud muslim british but bruv arabic is more sexiest than english and that is a fact
the word fuck seems to holding its ground and thank fuck for that although no doubt the pc feminist brigade will no doubt be onto soon enough as being a word allied to male domination
my good friend dick would beg to disagree with your analysis
all brilliant words in my opinion particular favourite has got to be tart
rogue originally a vagrant now any man whos a hit with the ladies
when your argument can be turned on its head with ease its a sign of a naff argument why shouldnt rabid feminist be used youre a damn sight more likely to come across one of those than a rabid communistas for nagging and shrill i suspect even most women would acknowledge its a female trait far more than a male and shrill involves a highpitched voice which most men dont have
i came across courtesan in fairly recent account of the profumo affair and ward trial it seemed as if the authors were trying to find the least pejorative expression
you can say the same about paedophilia right its only a problem if youre looking at it

id love to be upgraded to caveman they call me a dinosaur
dictionaries record actual word usage and the oxford demonstrates usage at various points in time by giving contemporary examples dictionaries are an information repository not a social engineering tool
this is all double plus ungood seriously theres a controversy and oxford dictionaries are under fire because of one academic hoping to make a name for themselves on twitter of course oed responded in the classically bad way first of all they bothered to respond and then they apologised the twatterati now spell blood and will demand a human sacrifice if only the guardian could get half as outraged about current situations affecting women i wont name them for obvious reasons
excellent article can we have another on class please the progression from unemployed to skiver from humanitarian to rabid leftie being examples

as are all the words for female genitalia including the one perceived to be the most insulting
strumpet now youve got me thinking of the landlords daughter not to mention the strumpets of yore
sorry will but were on a mission here to change the dictionary we no longer want the dictionary to oversee usage we want it to actively encourage and discourage certain usage and outright erase some words you see language is powerful and we want to harness that power to make sure our particular worldview is reflected in the lexicon it hasnt yet occurred to us that making an insane song and dance over the fact that the word rabid was once placed next to feminism might actually reflect something of a fanatical obsession with feminism and policing the way it is perceived contrast our outrage over this with our reaction to something like oh i dont know hundreds of women being sexually assaulted in a german city centre and youll see that we have our priorities firmly in order and as a result its clear that a pejorative adjective placed next to the sacrosanct noun feminism

the thing is that there are equivalent masculine terms that you could say are derogatory bloke being a nameless man dork a modern word for men that is insulting etc the list of negative words for men is nigh endless also if you want to say that a language is sexist look at the words with double meanings look at spanish and its words you have things like esposas which doubles up as wives or handcuffs to marry cazar in spanish is very similar as to hunt and in music etc they are indistinguishable these are the marks of a truly sexist language minas in south america means mines mines or women plumbing the depths indeed just because there are words for women that are not used for men does not make a language sexist these are descriptive words and one cannot expect all to be positive it is natural that some are negative thats just how men and women are the true mark of a sexist language is the common words that are also specifically used to denigrate women personally i see english as a militarysporting language we have many common words like compound shield information are you in formation that show our true roots

thats fine for the has rabies definition of rabid
the gay bachelor could now have a civil partnership of course
in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world why choose feminist over say rightwinger communist or fan though as if not quite convinced by its own explanation the oup is now reviewing the example sentence for rabid to ensure that it reflects current usage why is it more acceptable to insult those groups the only one out of that list id say that gets used with rabid as much is communist and thats probably not as up to date i dont think the dictionary writers should be making decisions based on whose politics they find more tolerable
members of the british artmed forces used to refer to falkalnd island natives as bennies after the eponymous crossroads character once crossroads arrived on the islands and they realised the inherent insult in the name the islanders complained the servicemen were told to stop using that name they changed it to stills because as far as they were concerned the islanders were still bennies i like orwell a fiercely intelligent man who is much missed in writing as this piece testifies but language always finds a way

the authors argument is a fallacy all languages have derogatory words of various types whose use reflects society abolish them for ideological reasons and new forms would spring up quickly it is the way words are used that is negative not the fact they exist changing words is about more than editing dictionaries or arguing on twitter
well blow me down who would have thought that society in the middle ages through to the late th and early th centuries was inherently sexist
